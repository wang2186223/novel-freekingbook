###Chapter 1: Rebirth

"Ugh—"

Luna White gasped as a sharp pain shot through the back of her head. Instinctively, she reached up and felt a lump the size of an egg. Darkness swam before her eyes, and the pungent stench of manure—cow and pig—filled her nostrils.

"Am I... dead?" she murmured.

Memories flooded back. She remembered the moment Maya White had run her over with a car, the venomous hatred in that woman’s eyes. But if she were dead, why could she still feel pain?

The familiar grunting of a sow from the nearby pigpen made her shudder.

Her eyes snapped open.

In the dim light, a tattered calendar hung on the cracked earthen wall. The date—July 8, 1985—burned into her vision like a brand.

"Did I... go back in time?"

Luna stared in disbelief at her calloused yet slender hands. This was her eighteen-year-old body, fresh out of high school.

Fragments of her past life flashed through her mind. That summer, her grandmother Clara White had beaten her bloody with a fire poker for refusing to leave the village and work in the city like the other girls.

"Ungrateful brat!" Clara’s voice still echoed in her ears. "Your brother Ethan sends his army pay home to feed us, and you dare dream of running away?"

Luna clenched her jaw. Last time, she had lain unconscious with fever for three days. When she woke, Clara had lied, telling her she’d failed the college entrance exams. Only years later did she learn the truth—her acceptance letter had been tossed into the bamboo grove behind the mountain.

"Not this time," she whispered, digging her nails into her palms. "No one will fool me again."

Her head throbbed, but she couldn’t afford to pass out. She needed to treat the wound before it worsened—just like last time.

But the village doctor wouldn’t help her. Everyone knew Clara was too stingy to spare a single coin.

Then, realization struck.

"Supernatural Ability..."

In her past life, after being sold to a gambler for marriage, she had fallen off a cliff while escaping. At the brink of death, an inexplicable power had surged through her—healing her injuries and granting her the ability to cure others.

"Guess I’ll have to die again."

Gritting her teeth, she pushed herself up and spotted the rusted sickle in the corner. Its blade gleamed coldly in the dim light, as if beckoning her.

Luna took a deep breath and gripped the handle.

Pain seared through her, yet a bitter smile curled her lips. If fate had given her a second chance, this time, she would make every tormentor pay in blood.

"Clara White... Jack White..." She spat their names like poison. "Just you wait."

The sickle sliced across her wrist. Blood gushed out. Darkness swallowed her vision—but her smile only widened.

This time, she would rewrite her destiny.
###Chapter 2: Filling the Belly

Luna White pushed open the creaky wooden door with effort, already breaking into a sweat from the few steps to the doorway. Her legs trembled weakly, and her stomach burned with hunger.

In this household, she was nothing but an unwanted burden. Her grandmother, Clara White, and uncle, Jack White, constantly berated her as a "freeloader," denying her even the right to eat at the table. Every meal, she had to crouch in the corner of the kitchen, waiting to scavenge scraps.

Her cousins—Maya White and the others—never left her anything decent. At best, she got half a bowl of watery cornmeal porridge or a chunk of rock-hard steamed bread. Wheat-flour buns? Forget about it. Often, she had to dilute the leftovers with water and scrape the pot clean just to make a meager "meal."

The most ridiculous part? In her past life, she had never even thought of stealing food. Day after day, she slaved away in the smoke-filled kitchen, dizzy with hunger from the tantalizing smells, yet still foolishly obeyed the rules. No wonder she had withered into this skeletal frame, ready to collapse at the slightest breeze.

Serves me right for dying so miserably last time, Luna thought bitterly. No brains, no backbone—who else would die but me?

By her count, she had been unconscious for a full day. That old hag Clara wouldn’t have bothered bringing her food. Right now, filling her stomach was the top priority.

Leaning against the wall, Luna slowly made her way outside. The damp, low-ceilinged adobe hut didn’t even need a lock—who would steal from a "worthless burden"? The rest of the White family lived in bright, sturdy brick houses.

The moment she stepped into the yard, she ran into Maya. This cousin, just a month older, was plump and fair-skinned, her chest already full—the picture of a young woman. Meanwhile, Luna looked like an underdeveloped scarecrow.

"Stop pretending to be half-dead!" Maya rolled her eyes. "Grandma just hit you a few times. Hurry up and cook! If she comes back from work and finds you lazing around, you’ll get another beating!"

Truthfully, Clara had checked on Luna that morning, realizing she’d gone too far. She’d told Maya to handle the cooking, but the girl had burned the porridge and sliced the pickles as thick as fingers. Now that Luna was moving again, Maya was quick to dump the responsibility back on her.

Luna watched coldly as Maya sashayed back to her room for a nap. In this house, she was treated worse than a dog. It wasn’t until her past life, when Jack let it slip, that she learned she wasn’t even a White by blood. She was the child of "capitalist roaders," entrusted to her adoptive parents, John and Mary White.

Her adoptive parents had treated her as their own, and her older brother, Ethan White, along with her two sisters, had genuinely cared for her. But none of them had known that the nineteen dollars sent monthly as her "living expenses" had all gone into Clara and Jack’s pockets—while she starved.

And the stupidest part? She had helped cover it up! Every time her siblings visited, Clara would dress her in clean clothes for show. And like an idiot, she had played along, thinking she shouldn’t burden her family.

Not this time.

Luna marched straight into the kitchen, easily locating the flour jar. She could find Clara’s hidden food stores blindfolded.

Soon, a pot of steaming noodle soup was ready. She cracked two eggs into the broth and sprinkled it with fresh green onions. The tangy aroma of pickled cabbage made her mouth water.

After downing a bowl, strength seeped back into her limbs. Wiping her mouth, Luna’s gaze sharpened.

From now on, no one would starve her again. Every debt would be repaid—down to the last cent.
###Chapter 3: A Fateful Encounter

Luna White set down her chopsticks and wiped her mouth. In her past life, her supernatural ability had awakened only in a life-or-death situation. This time, she had no choice but to gamble.

She had to obtain this power, even if it cost her life.

The risk was great, but worth taking.

Without strength to rely on, how could she protect her family? How could she make those who wronged her pay in blood?

She strode out with purpose.

The White family’s courtyard sat at the heart of the village. The image of Liupan Village from decades ago was still vivid in her mind—only the mayor and the security chief’s homes were made of brick, while the rest were mud huts that needed fresh plaster every year.

The backyard housed the pigpen, which also served as her "bedroom." The two pigs were the family’s most valuable assets, and she was probably the second most valuable "property."

The chicken coop in the front yard held a few hens—the family’s "little treasury." Feeding them was her chore, but she never got to taste the eggs.

Maya, Ethan, and Bai Zhuang each got one egg a day, while she didn’t even get the shells. On holidays when a pig or chicken was slaughtered, a bowl of vegetable soup with a few drops of oil floating on top was her greatest luxury.

Yet even that meager portion was something Clara White begrudged her, always finding excuses to send her away.

Just as she stepped out the gate, she ran straight into her grandmother, Uncle Jack, his wife, and Bai Zhuang, returning from the fields.

Bai Zhuang, twenty years old and as burly as his name suggested, cared nothing for Luna’s well-being. His only concerns were the harvest and Lisa Wilson—his future wife.

At the thought of Lisa, Luna’s eyes turned cold. In her past life, that lazy woman had bossed her around relentlessly, even making her wash menstrual rags. Later, she was sold off to a gambler—all because Lisa wanted the dowry money.

The moment Clara spotted Luna, her sharp eyes narrowed. "Worthless girl! Why aren’t you working? If you can stand, you’re coming to the fields this afternoon—or no food for you!"

Jack frowned. He was known as the village’s "nice guy," obsessed with his reputation.

"Luna," he said with feigned concern, "your grandmother only disciplined you for your own good. If you’re feeling better, join us in the fields this afternoon. It’s harvest season."

Luna smirked. This "kind uncle" was a master at playing the saint while letting others do his dirty work.

"Uncle," she said loudly, ensuring the nearby villagers could hear, "Grandmother beat me bloody yesterday. I spent the night in the pigpen, and I’m in pain all over. I need to see the doctor—I won’t be able to work this afternoon. Maya’s sleeping at home. Why not send her instead?"

She paused deliberately. "I wouldn’t want to die sick and bring shame on you for mistreating your niece."

Clara exploded. "You ungrateful brat! A few smacks and you need medicine? Do you think it grows on trees? If not for your uncle’s kindness, you’d have starved long ago!"

Jack’s face darkened. Since when had this girl become so sharp-tongued?
###Chapter 4: The Truth Revealed

Jack White rubbed his hands nervously, tugging at Clara White’s sleeve with a troubled expression. "Mom, calm down. We’re family. As her uncle, I couldn’t just let her starve. At least I managed to put her through high school—I did right by my late brother and his wife. She’s just a kid—should we really hold a grudge against her?"

He turned to Luna White with a practiced look of paternal concern. "Luna, I know you’re upset about failing the college entrance exam. But I really can’t afford to send you back for another year. We barely scrape by on what these fields bring in, and your cousins are at the age where they need to get married. Everything costs money..."

His words sounded noble, and the villagers watching nodded in approval. Everyone knew Jack was the most honest man in the village.

Seizing the moment, Clara lunged forward and pinched Luna’s arm hard.

"Listen to this, everyone! We raised this ungrateful brat, fed her, clothed her, and just because we won’t pay for more schooling, she holds a grudge! Yesterday, I gave her a couple of slaps—what parent doesn’t discipline their child? And what does she do? Today she runs off to the clinic for medicine, trying to make us look like monsters in front of the whole village!"

Tears streamed down Clara’s face as she played the victim perfectly.

The villagers’ expressions toward Luna shifted instantly. Who would’ve thought this quiet girl had such a spiteful heart?

"Don’t take it to heart, Auntie. She’s still young and foolish."
"Jack’s got it hard enough raising his own three kids, let alone his niece..."
"Luna, your grandma only hit you because she cares..."

Jack waved his hands humbly. "Enough, everyone. She’s still my niece. I’d sell everything I own before I let her suffer."

Another round of praise rose from the crowd.

Then Luna let out a cold laugh, her eyes red when she lifted her head.

"So that’s how it is... Uncle, I misunderstood you." Her voice trembled. "All this time, I thought my schooling was paid for by Ethan and Iris. Every time Ethan came home, he said he sent Grandma fifteen dollars a month from his military pay. Iris and Maya each saved two dollars from their in-laws’ households to contribute. They said no matter how hard it was, they’d make sure I got an education..."

Her words exploded like a bomb in the crowd.

Clara’s face drained of color. Jack broke out in a cold sweat. They never expected her to know about the money!

The women who had just defended them now looked disgusted. In the countryside, a soldier’s income was substantial—nineteen dollars a month added up to over two hundred a year!

And yet, Luna’s life had been one of relentless labor: chopping firewood before dawn, washing clothes and cooking after school, working like an ox during harvests... The villagers weren’t blind.

Luna wiped her tears. "I’ll go ask Iris where that money really went."

The crowd erupted in murmurs. Someone whispered, "No wonder the Whites built a new house and bought a bicycle these past two years..."

Clara’s legs gave out, and she nearly collapsed to the ground.
###Chapter 5: The Truth Revealed

Jack White's heart skipped a beat. Luna's words were practically pushing them into the fire.

If the whole village found out about this, wouldn’t they be pointing fingers and cursing them behind their backs?

He quickly stepped forward. "Luna, I swear I had no idea about this! I never saw a single cent of that money. You can’t accuse me like this!" With her older siblings gone, he could spin any lie he wanted.

Luna's lips curled slightly. "You didn’t take the money? Of course I believe you. In that case, someone must have been stealing it. My brother told me he sent the money through the post office every month. I’m going to the mayor to find out which greedy postal worker dared to embezzle our family’s money!"

She counted on her fingers. "From age 14 to 18—four whole years. That’s at least a thousand dollars, enough to build a house!"

Jack’s face turned pale.

This girl was determined to make a scene!

Luna wiped her tears and turned to the villagers. "Uncles, aunts, you have to stand up for me! My brother and sister worked so hard to send money home, and some thief took it all. Because of that, I’ve gone hungry, shivered in the cold, and never had a single new piece of clothing."

She pointed at her patched-up dress. "Look at this—it was made when my parents were still alive. It doesn’t even fit anymore. I’ve had to sew scraps together just to cover myself."

The villagers murmured among themselves, their gazes shifting toward Jack with suspicion.

Luna made a show of turning to leave. "I’m going straight to the mayor. That thief is going to jail!"

Jack lunged to stop her.

If this got investigated, the post office withdrawal slips would show their signatures!

He shot Clara a desperate look.

The old woman stomped her foot. "You stupid girl, stop lying! I took the money!"

The crowd erupted.

Just moments ago, she’d been bragging about how difficult it was to raise her granddaughter—now she was admitting to stealing her living expenses?

Luna pretended to be shocked. "Oh! So you took the money? You should’ve said so earlier—I almost blamed an innocent person."

She timidly held out her hand. "Then… since I need to see a doctor now, it’s only fair you give me some money, right? After all, it’s my siblings’ hard-earned cash."

Only then did the villagers notice the huge bump on Luna’s head and the bruises covering her body. They immediately started scolding Clara.

"Aunt Clara, are you trying to beat this child to death?"
"Take her to a doctor now, before it’s too late!"

Clara scoffed. "Country kids aren’t that fragile! She’ll be fine after resting a couple of days!"

Luna suddenly swayed, and Aunt Laura caught her.

"Oh my! This child is burning up with fever!" Laura gasped.

Jack knew he had to act fast.

"Mother! Why didn’t you say anything sooner?" he feigned distress. "Quick, give me two dollars—I’ll take Luna to the doctor."

Clara reluctantly dug out the money, but before she could hand it over, Luna snatched it from her grasp.

"Thank you, Grandma. Thank you, Uncle." Luna clenched the bills tightly, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.
###Chapter 6: Locking Horns

If those two dollars fell into Uncle Jack's hands, they wouldn't even buy a single fever-reducing pill. The rest would surely vanish into his pocket.

Luna White saw right through it. Every time her siblings secretly slipped her pocket money, Maya White had sweet-talked or tricked her out of it. Now her pockets were emptier than her face.

This was her own brother and sister's hard-earned money—why shouldn't she keep it?

"Uncle Jack, I can go to the clinic by myself. It's not convenient for you to tag along for injections and IVs," Luna said flatly, cutting him off.

Jack White frowned. Since when had this quiet niece suddenly grown a backbone? Her eyes were sharp as knives, her words quick and precise, and her tears came on command—as if she were a completely different person.

Clara White panicked. "Luna, give the money to your uncle. What if a young girl like you wastes it? Two dollars is too much just for a doctor's visit!" She couldn't make a scene in front of the villagers, so she forced herself to speak gently.

Luna smirked. If the money went to her uncle, how much would actually be left?

"Grandma, this money is from my brother and sister, right?" She deliberately raised her voice. With so many witnesses, would the old woman dare deny it?

Clara's face twisted before she managed a strained smile. "Of course... but your siblings worked hard for that money..."

"Exactly!" Luna swiftly tucked the bills into her pocket. "Spending it on me is what they'd want, isn't it? I'm eighteen—it's not like I'm going to buy candy at the clinic!"

Clara glared, but the money was already in Luna's possession. She couldn't snatch it back in public.

"Fine... go and come back quickly," the old woman ground out between clenched teeth.

Luna walked away without a backward glance. At least now she wouldn’t have to drag her feverish body to the clinic—she could finally relax.

The villagers dispersed in small groups. Humiliated, Clara was about to unleash a string of curses when Jack yanked her inside.

"Mom! Don’t embarrass us out here!" His face was dark with anger. If word of this got around, his reputation as the "kind uncle" would be ruined.

The moment they entered the yard, Clara plopped onto the steps in a huff. Ethan brought her a basin of water. "Grandma, wash your face."

"Dad, the water vat's almost empty," he added, lifting the lid with a frown.

Just as Fanny Hao stepped inside, she heard this and flew into a rage. "Where the hell is Luna? Why hasn’t she fetched water yet?"

"Mom, she went to the clinic," Ethan murmured.

"What? Where’d she get money?" Fanny’s voice shot up an octave. "Mom! You can’t spoil her like this! We don’t have money for her to see a doctor—we still need dowries for Ethan and the others!"

Clara, already fuming, exploded. "That was her own brother and sister’s money! If you want some, go ask your own family!"

Fanny froze. Since when had the old woman ever defended Luna?

Jack shot her a venomous look. "Get in the kitchen and cook! Stop gossiping!"

Fanny scurried off, but a sudden scream erupted from the kitchen—
###Chapter 7: The Secret Plot

"That wretched girl dared not cook?" Clara White yanked open the pot lid, her chest tightening at the sight of the empty iron pot.

Maya White had been lounging in her room but bolted into the kitchen at the commotion. "Impossible! I saw Luna go in there myself!" She stamped her foot in frustration.

Jack White kicked over a washbasin, the deafening clang silencing the entire household.

"You were told to cook, and you slacked off!" Clara jabbed a finger at Maya, though she knew the truth—Maya had shirked her duty the moment Luna woke up. Hadn’t she considered the same?

Maya retorted defiantly, "Who knew she’d grow such a spine? Eating our food, living under our roof, and acting like some pampered lady?"

Before she could finish, Jack slapped her hard across the face. "Get in there and cook!"

Maya froze, clutching her stinging cheek. Her father had never laid a hand on her before.

Clara pulled her granddaughter close, wincing at the swelling on Maya’s face.

"Grandma!" Tears streamed down Maya’s cheeks. "It’s all that jinx’s fault! The moment she woke up, I got hit!"

"Enough," Clara nudged her toward the kitchen. "Your father’s in a foul mood. Go help your mother."

When even her grandmother refused to take her side, Maya stormed off, her braid whipping behind her.

"You went too far," Clara scolded Jack. "What if you ruined her face? How will she marry now?"

Jack’s expression darkened. Luna’s defiance today unsettled him. That girl was smart—what if she actually got into university?

"Think about it, Mother," he muttered. "If word gets out, what will the village say? Ethan’s engagement is set, but what about Maya and the others?"

Clara gritted her teeth. "That little wretch has lost her mind today! Two dollars for medicine! Tonight, we’ll break her legs!"

A calculating gleam flashed in Jack’s eyes. "Keep an eye on the mailman these next few days. We’ll need more money from Ethan too. As for the engagement..."

"Don’t worry," Clara sneered. "The moment that Acceptance Letter arrives, I’ll tear it up and toss it into the hills! We raised her—it’s time she paid us back!"

Just then, Clara’s daughter-in-law burst out of the kitchen, shaking with rage. "Mother, look! Not only did she skip cooking, she stole flour and eggs!"

In her hands were unmistakable shards of eggshell.

Clara’s vision swam. So, Luna was staging a rebellion.

"Just wait," the old woman hissed through clenched teeth, her grip on the cane turning her knuckles white.
###Chapter 8: The Egg Incident

Luna White dragged her heavy feet into the village clinic. The village doctor, Dr. Steven Davis, had once been a barefoot physician, roaming the countryside with his medical kit for years. When the government mandated every village to establish a clinic a few years back and no suitable candidate could be found, the mayor and villagers agreed to let Uncle Steven take the role.

He took her temperature, his frown deepening. "103.1°F!" he exclaimed. "Any higher, and you’ll fry your brain." The wound on the girl’s head was caked with dirt and dust—clearly infected, causing the fever.

After administering a fever-reducing injection, Dr. Steven counted out a dozen pills and pressed them into Luna’s hands. "Two pills, three times a day," he instructed. "Keep the wound dry and rest." He sighed, knowing his advice would likely fall on deaf ears. The White girl was notorious in the village for her relentless work ethic—no one truly expected her to slow down.

Luna thanked him and pulled money from her pocket. Dr. Steven hesitated—villagers usually settled medical bills at year’s end. He accepted fifty cents and handed back the remaining change.

Stepping out of the clinic, Luna felt slightly lighter. Sweat soaked her clothes, as if carrying away some of the fever. She carefully tucked away the remaining dollar fifty, already planning her next steps as she walked.

Her Acceptance Letter should arrive any day now. That life-changing document Clara White had stolen from her in her past life—this time, she would secure it no matter what. Did they really think she’d keep slaving away for the Whites? Not a chance!

But getting the letter was just the first step. Though the state provided subsidies, travel expenses and supplies still needed to be covered. The Whites would never pay, and her sisters’ families were barely scraping by. The memory of her eldest sister falling off a cliff searching for her and her second sister wasting away from illness in her past life sent a sharp pang through her chest. This time, she would protect them all.

Her supernatural ability! She suddenly remembered the power she’d gained later—the one that could bring the dead back to life. If she could reclaim it, her siblings would never suffer again.

When she returned to the White family courtyard, the household was gathered under the persimmon tree for dinner. Not a single glance was spared for her as she entered. Used to the cold reception, Luna called out, "Grandma," and turned toward her room.

"Stop right there!" Clara slammed her chopsticks down, dishes clattering.

Luna froze, her peripheral vision catching the neighbors eating in their own yard next door. The gate stood wide open—an easy escape if needed.

"What is it, Grandma?" she feigned ignorance.

"How dare you ask!" Clara’s beady eyes narrowed. "Was it you who took the flour? Did you steal the eggs? Such greed at your age—what will people say about our family?"

Luna smiled. "You knocked me unconscious yesterday and left me without food or water all day. When I woke up at noon looking for leftovers, there was nothing. Don’t Maya and the others get flour and eggs when they’re sick? I thought that was the rule, so I made myself some noodle soup." She deliberately raised her voice. "Or am I not allowed to eat that when I’m sick?"

"You worthless brat!" Clara shrieked, hopping in fury. "How dare you compare yourself to Maya? You’ll eat us out of house and home!"

Jack White’s expression darkened. He’d just told the whole village that morning that the old woman had taken Luna’s money—accusing her of freeloading now would only make him look like a liar.
###Chapter 9: Bloodstained Truth

Luna White curled her lips into a cold smile, her gaze shifting between Clara White and Jack White. "Grandma, that’s not quite right. The whole village heard you admit today that you’ve been taking 19 dollars a month from my brother and sister for my living expenses." She paused deliberately. "Even if I ate eggs and fine flour every day, that money would be more than enough."

She turned to Jack, her eyes sharpening. "Uncle, do you also think I’ve been freeloading? Then let’s settle this properly. There are 365 days in a year, and I’ve worked in the fields for at least a hundred of them. Every pig and chicken in this house—who do you think fed them? So, I don’t even deserve an egg?"

Luna slammed her hands on the table, rattling the dishes. "Let’s make this clear today! If you think I eat too much, Grandma, give me back the money, and I’ll move back to the old house right now!"

Jack’s face darkened. His timid niece, who never dared to speak up, was now challenging him to his face.

"You ungrateful brat!" Clara shrieked, her rheumy eyes darting around. "That money is my pension! It’s got nothing to do with you!" Spotting a carrying pole in the corner, she grabbed it and swung at Luna.

Luna had been ready for this. She needed to take the hit—only blood would expose the truth about the White family to the whole village. She deliberately angled herself toward a metal hook. With a sickening tear, her sleeve split open, revealing a deep gash.

"Ah!" Blood soaked her sleeve instantly. Clutching her wound, Luna bolted out the door, her wail piercing the night. "Help! Murder! Mayor Clark, help me!"

The first to rush out was Aunt Laura from next door, who nearly fainted at the sight. "Good heavens! This—this is going to kill her!" She caught Luna as she swayed, her hands coming away sticky with blood.

More villagers gathered as word spread. Luna slumped in Aunt Laura’s arms, her voice weak. "It’s my fault… I shouldn’t have eaten that bowl of fine flour… shouldn’t have mentioned the money Ethan sends…" She coughed violently, spitting blood. "But I… I didn’t know… Uncle was making my brother pay for Grandma’s pension…"

The words exploded like thunder among the crowd. Elderly Mrs. Wright, a respected figure in the village, hobbled forward with her cane. "Jack White! Have you no shame? Making your nephew and niece support your mother—are you dead or crippled?"

Jack turned ashen. He never expected his meek niece to set such a trap for him. As the villagers muttered and pointed, he reached for Luna. "She’s delirious with fever! Come on, Uncle will take you to the clinic—"

"Don’t touch me!" Luna shrieked, recoiling as if from a monster. "Last time you said that… you locked me in the woodshed for three days…" She deliberately revealed old bruises on her arm, sobbing hysterically. "I’ll wait for Mayor Clark!"

Right on cue, George Clark pushed through the crowd with Security Chief Paul Jackson. Luna’s vision darkened—she allowed herself to faint, satisfied.

The play had succeeded.
###Chapter 10: The Mask Comes Off

Jack White glanced down at the gruesome wound on Luna White's arm—the flesh torn open, blood dripping. His eyelids twitched violently as he quickly put on a pained expression, his eyes reddening instantly.

Aunt Wang finally relaxed. It seemed she had misjudged Jack earlier. After all, everyone in the village knew his reputation for kindness. How could he possibly do something so heartless? There must be more to the story.

"What's going on here, Jack? Heard someone's about to die in your house?" Mayor George Clark and Security Chief Paul Jackson rushed over, gasping at the sight of Luna's bloodied arm.

"Good heavens! Luna, what happened?" George hurried forward. "Tell me what's wrong, and I'll make it right!"

Though village squabbles were common, things turning deadly was serious. As mayor, he couldn’t afford such a scandal.

Jack forced a smile. "Mayor, Chief, sorry to trouble you. Just a disobedient child—I’ll take her to get treated right away. We can talk later... Ah, kids these days, so distant..."

"Go now! In this heat, infection is no joke!" Paul frowned. "If Old Steven can’t handle it, take the tractor to the county hospital. Jack, I’m warning you—even if she’s not your blood, you’ll face the law if this turns fatal!"

Jack nodded repeatedly. Hearing the mayor’s softened tone, he sighed inwardly in relief. "Don’t worry, Mayor. I’ve treated Luna like my own all these years. Come on, Luna, let’s—"

Luna’s eyes turned icy.

She knew Jack too well. The Whites cared deeply about appearances, always putting on a show for outsiders. If she left with him now, this would be swept under the rug. They’d spin some story—say she stole food—and the whole village would brand her ungrateful.

After this, no one would stand up for her again. And that old witch Clara would only torment her worse.

"I’m not going!" Luna shoved Jack away, shrinking back. "Grandma said the money from my siblings is for her retirement—I don’t deserve to spend it on medical care. I’ve been freeloading at Uncle’s for four years. Stealing flour and eggs today was wrong..."

Her voice cracked. "I just thought... if I was sick, I could eat something good for once. If I’d known it was Uncle’s family’s food, I’d never have touched it..."

Jack’s face darkened.

This wretched girl was airing their dirty laundry in public! Every word was a slap to his face.

"I know I’m unwanted..." Luna wiped her tears. "I did all the chores, just to please you. But no matter how hard I worked, I could never be as loved as Maya, always dressed up like a princess..."

She tugged at her faded, patched clothes—sleeves too short, fabric worn thin. "These were from my parents. I’ve made up my mind. I’ll go back to the old house. I’d rather starve than beg here again!"

The villagers finally noticed Luna’s tattered clothes—while at the gate, Maya stood smugly in a brand-new floral dress.

The crowd erupted.
###Chapter 11: The Saboteur

In the rural 1980s, who didn't wear the same clothes for years? Patches upon patches were common—hand-me-downs from elder siblings to younger ones, and when garments became utterly unwearable, they'd still be repurposed for shoe soles. But Maya White from the White household? Just days ago, Clara had been boasting through the village about making new clothes for her daughter's upcoming matchmaking.

Today, Maya wore a pristine white floral blouse, brand-new khaki trousers, and those eye-catching black canvas shoes with white trim. What village girl wouldn't envy her? Everyone knew the Whites had Ethan, their soldier son, who never lacked fabric ration coupons. Then there was Luna beside her—her worn-out black shoes revealing two toes!

"Aiyah, why does Ethan's fabric allowance only buy new clothes for his cousin while his own sister dresses like this?" muttered Aunt Elizabeth.

"Exactly! In dead winter, Luna fetches water at dawn, gathers pigweed, tends chickens, and washes the whole family's laundry at night..." added Mrs. Laura.

"And Maya? All she does is crack sunflower seeds and gossip!"

Jack White burned under the neighbors' pointed stares. Luna seized the moment, clutching her tattered hem with trembling hands: "Uncle... I know I'm no match for Maya... but Grandma was going to beat me to death! If I hadn't run out, would you have told everyone I died of illness?"

The words struck like thunder. Jack jumped up, frantic: "Luna! How could you think that of me?"

Before he could finish, Clara lunged, seizing Luna's arm—directly on a fresh bruise. Luna gasped, tears welling.

"Clara! Still resorting to violence?" Aunt Elizabeth yanked her away.

Clara trembled with rage: "This wretched girl lies! I just hit her a little too hard—"

Luna shoved up her sleeve, revealing mottled purple welts: "Too hard? Last night, just because I refused factory work, you beat me half to death with a fire poker!" She turned to the crowd: "Four years—I haven't eaten cornbread, just dishwater leftovers..."

The villagers erupted.

"Starving a child in 1985?"
"The Whites have grain to spare!"
"Treating blood kin worse than a stray?"

Luna wiped her tears, voice breaking: "Mayor Clark, I'm eighteen—let me return to my own home!" Her mind was clear—if she stayed, her uncle would sell her family house by year's end.

Jack went sheet-white. Clara screeched: "You ungrateful—"

"Raised me?" Luna's gaze turned razor-sharp. "Grandma... am I even a real White?"

The question doused Clara like ice water.
###Chapter 12: The Key Dispute

Luna White's words exploded like a bomb, instantly stirring up the crowd. The villagers exchanged uneasy glances—no one had expected the White family to treat an orphaned girl so cruelly behind closed doors.

"Oh my God! This isn't raising a child, it's outright abuse!" Aunt Zhang gasped, covering her mouth.

"Exactly! Luna isn't even Jack White's own daughter. How heartless can they be?" Aunt Wang chimed in indignantly.

Tears streamed down Luna's face like broken pearls, her voice trembling. "The aunties are right. During holidays, I had to wait until they finished eating before I could soak cornmeal buns in leftover broth. Grandma said... said I didn't deserve better."

Her frail body shivered slightly, her threadbare clothes making her appear even more pitiful.

"Bullshit!" Aunt Li stamped her foot angrily. "Jack White, your family has seven able-bodied men! You sell pigs and grain every year, yet you'd deny this child even a bite of decent food?"

"Damn right!" Mrs. Zhao planted her hands on her hips. "If my family had nineteen dollars, we'd make dumplings for Luna every single meal!"

Sweat dripped from Jack's forehead, soaking through his shirt. He glanced around furtively, the villagers' furious stares making him squirm.

"Luna..." He feigned remorse. "Uncle had no idea! Your grandma told me you—"

"No idea?" Luna cut him off with a bitter laugh. "Every time Grandma beat me, it was in front of the whole family. You had no idea? That I'd get beaten if a single steamed bun went missing? You had no idea?"

Her voice suddenly rose. "Uncle, please just give me the key. Let me live on my own—it's better than being beaten to death!"

Clara White exploded at this. "How dare you defy me! I'm your grandmother—everything I do is for your own good! Want to leave? Over my dead body!"

Her wrinkled face twisted into something terrifying as she glared at Luna.

"Grandma..." Luna's voice shook. "Are you really going to drive me to my death?"

"Ungrateful brat!" Clara spat. "Mark my words—if you dare leave, I'll kill myself right here! Let the whole village see how you drove your own grandmother to her grave!"

Jack theatrically grabbed his mother's arm. "Mom, don't say such—"

"Get off me!" Clara shoved him away. "After all these years raising her, this is how she repays me? A viper in my bosom!"

The crowd could no longer contain their outrage:

"This is outrageous!"
"They're going to kill that poor girl!"
"Jack White, have you no shame?"

Luna stood at the center, her slight frame swaying unsteadily. She bit her lip until she tasted blood.

That key—she would get it today, no matter what.
###Chapter 13: The Push

Clara White's wrist suddenly throbbed with pain. She turned to see Luna White's chillingly cold eyes staring back at her. The girl's grip was like an iron vise, her nails digging deep into Clara's flesh.

"You little brat! Have you lost your mind?" Clara gasped through the pain.

A cold smirk curled at the corner of Luna's lips. "Didn't you say you wanted to die to make me look bad? Didn't you want to brand me as unfilial?" She yanked Clara forward, dragging her toward the village outskirts. "Come on, I'll make your wish come true!"

Clara stumbled as Luna pulled her along. Jack White tried to intervene, but Luna dodged him effortlessly. She moved with terrifying speed, hauling Clara like a vengeful spirit.

"Help! She's trying to kill me!" Clara shrieked.

Mayor George Clark paled when he saw the direction they were heading—the village reservoir, deep enough to drown an ox.

"Luna! Let's talk this through!" George shouted, rushing after them with a group of villagers. "I'll make sure justice is served!"

But Luna had already dragged Clara onto the dam. The wind howled, and the dark water below looked menacing.

"You wanted to die, didn’t you?" Luna's voice was eerily soft. "I'll jump with you. Let the whole village see how you drove your own granddaughter to her death."

Clara's legs trembled. She never actually wanted to die—she’d just been trying to scare the girl.

"You're insane! A complete lunatic!" She scrambled backward, desperate to escape.

George and the villagers were closing in. Seizing her chance, Clara twisted free—and with a sudden, vicious shove—

SPLASH.

A deafening silence followed.

Clara blinked, only now realizing what she’d done. She spun toward George, cowering behind him. "Mayor, save me! She was trying to kill me!"

George's face turned ashen. "Quick! Someone get in the water!"

Jack shoved Clara away, his voice shaking with fury. "Mom! You pushed Luna in!"

Clara stood frozen. She stared at her hands, then at the empty dam. A violent shiver wracked her body.

Beneath the dark water, Luna smiled as the icy lake swallowed her.

That push?

Exactly what she’d wanted.

###Chapter 14: Between Life and Death

Luna White never expected Clara White to be so strong.

A violent shove sent her tumbling toward the water like a broken kite. The wind howled in her ears, her heart pounding as if trying to escape her chest.

Splash!

The icy water swallowed her whole. The cold stabbed into every pore, the pressure crushing her ribs like a hammer. She thrashed, but her limbs felt leaden.

Am I dying? Her consciousness dimmed.

The darkness of the depths swallowed the dam's outline. Her lungs burned, memories of her past life flashing before her.

Then—a shadow cut through the water.

Andrew Smith had been training his recruits at the base of the dam. Summer flood drills were routine, but today, disaster struck.

"Someone fell in!" His pupils contracted.

The figure plunged like a leaf, vanishing into the churning current.

"All units, move!"

Twenty young men dove in unison. Andrew shot forward like a swordfish, straight for the impact point.

Visibility was near zero. On his third resurface, he finally glimpsed a pale flutter of fabric.

Luna felt iron arms lock around her. Through the haze, she saw frantic eyes, short hair drifting like seaweed.

Whoosh—

The moment they broke the surface, darkness claimed her.

Chaos erupted onshore. Mayor George Clark arrived with villagers just as Andrew hauled the girl onto the bank.

"She's not breathing!" someone screamed.

Andrew dropped to his knees in the mud, pounding on her back. Her face was ghostly pale, lips tinged violet, strands of riverweed clinging to her skin.

"Back up!" He barked at the gawkers.

Fingers probed her icy mouth, clearing the blockage. He scanned the crowd. "She needs CPR. Any female volunteers—?"

The crowd retreated as one.

"I'll do it." Without hesitation, he pinched her nose and bent down.

"Good heavens!" A woman peeked through her fingers.

After a dozen breaths, Luna convulsed, coughing up bloody water. Her chest finally rose.

"She's alive!" George mopped his brow.

When Luna opened her eyes, a sharply angled face filled her vision. Water dripped from his jawline onto her cheek—scalding despite the chill.

"Easy." His voice was rough. "Andrew Smith."

Then she remembered—the name from her past life's newspapers. The youngest flood-control hero. Now, his camouflage dripped onto her, refracting sunlight like scattered gems.

###Chapter 15: Taking Charge

"Sir, here's a towel!" A student hastily handed over a dry towel.

Andrew Smith took it but didn't use it on himself. Instead, he removed his camouflage jacket and wrapped it around Luna White. The girl was drenched, her thin summer clothes clinging to her body, revealing her curves. He frowned—this crowd was too large, and he wouldn't let her be humiliated.

Luna coughed violently, her fingers clutching the front of her shirt. She could feel the familiar power stirring within her—her supernatural ability had returned.

But she wouldn’t use it now. She wanted everyone to see the proof—her disheveled state was undeniable evidence that Clara White had pushed her into the water.

"Luna!" Jack White rushed over, genuine tears in his eyes this time. "You scared me half to death!"

Mayor George Clark also exhaled in relief and quickly stepped forward to shake Andrew’s hand. "Thank you so much, young man! If it weren’t for you—"

"You’re the mayor?" Andrew cut him off, his gaze sharp.

"Yes, yes. I’m George Clark, mayor of Willowbrook Village."

Andrew pointed to the dam. "We saw someone push her in. That’s attempted murder. The police should be called immediately." His voice was calm, but it sent a chill through the crowd.

Jack panicked. If this went to the police, how would his family ever hold their heads high in the village again?

"It’s a misunderstanding, sir!" He wrung his hands anxiously. "Just a family quarrel. My mother didn’t mean to—"

Mayor Clark chimed in, "That’s right, young man. It’s just a domestic matter..."

Luna sneered. Of course. As long as no one died, who would care about an orphan like her?

Clara lunged forward, arms outstretched to embrace her. "Granny was wrong! But you threatened to take me down with you—"

Luna shrank back, her voice barely a whisper. "I... I slipped..."

Andrew’s frown deepened. She was clearly lying.

"Even if it was an accident, there should be consequences." He fixed his gaze on Mayor Clark. "Where are her parents?"

"The poor girl lost them years ago..." Sweat beaded on the mayor’s forehead. These military cadets weren’t easily fooled.

"Mayor." Andrew raised his voice abruptly. "You need to handle this fairly today."

Mayor Clark stiffened, then turned and barked at Jack, "You heard him! Hand over the keys to Luna’s house right now, or your family won’t get a single grain of relief rations this year!"

Jack’s eyes darted around. He could agree now and figure things out later...

"Now." Andrew’s voice was icy. "We’ll go with you to get them."

Luna’s head snapped up, meeting Andrew’s steady gaze. He gave her a slight nod, as if to say: Don’t worry. We’ve got you.

Her nose stung, and she rasped, "Sir... could you help me clean up my house?"

Andrew bent down to help her up, the scent of soap and sunlight clinging to his uniform.

"Listen up," he called to his students. "We finish what we start."

The wind over the dam suddenly felt warm.
###Chapter 16: I Want to Go Home

"Ah!" Luna White cried out in pain, her face instantly turning deathly pale.

Clara White had her granddaughter's arm in a vice-like grip, her nails digging deep into the flesh. The unhealed wound on Luna's arm was torn open again, the waterlogged skin now an even ghastlier shade of white, fresh blood welling up where Clara's fingers had left deep marks.

"Stop!" Andrew Smith seized Clara's wrist with such force that she yelped and let go.

Clara flinched at his sharp command. "W-what's wrong with disciplining my own granddaughter?" she blustered. "This girl has no parents—if it weren't for me and her uncle raising her, she'd have starved to death! Now she's grown wings and refuses to come home. Do you know how much that hurts me—"

Andrew ignored her excuses, tearing open Luna's sleeve. The gathered villagers gasped in horror.

The slender arm was covered in bruises—old wounds layered with fresh ones, mottled purple and blue. The most shocking was the jagged, still-bleeding gash where the skin had split open.

"Mayor!" Andrew's voice was ice-cold.

George Clark hurried over, his face darkening when he saw Luna's injuries. "Clara White! Are you trying to kill her?"

"Who doesn't discipline their children?" Clara retorted stubbornly. "I raised her father the same way—"

"Enough!" Andrew snapped. "Mayor, we must report this. Under Criminal Law Article 260, severe abuse of family members carries a sentence of up to two years in prison."

Clara's legs buckled, nearly sending her to the ground. Since when was disciplining a child against the law?

Jack White pushed through the crowd, sweating profusely. "A misunderstanding! Just a misunderstanding! My mother is old—she doesn't understand these things..." He turned to Luna with a forced smile. "Luna, come home with Uncle. No one will lay a finger on you again."

Luna shrank behind Andrew, her trembling fingers clutching the hem of his shirt.

"Miss White," Andrew said gently, "what do you want to do?"

The girl lifted her tear-filled eyes, her voice barely audible. "I... I just want to go home." She glanced at Clara's ashen face and added, "Grandma is old... I won't press charges."

Andrew raised an eyebrow. This girl might seem fragile, but she knew exactly where to strike.

"Mayor?" He gave George a meaningful look.

"Of course! I'll arrange for her house to be prepared immediately!" George wiped his brow.

Jack wrung his hands. "No need to trouble the soldiers—we'll handle it ourselves—"

"No trouble at all." Andrew cut him off, turning to his cadets. "Men, is helping our fellow citizens part of serving the people?"

"Yes, sir!" The twenty-odd young men answered in unison, startling a flock of sparrows from the trees.

Jack's face turned green. He had hoped to stall, but these soldiers weren’t giving him an inch.

"Lead the way," Andrew said with a faint smile. "Perfect chance for the cadets to experience rural life."

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground. Luna quietly wiped her tears, the ghost of a smile touching her lips.

###Chapter 17: I Don't Want to Die

Clara White hunched her shoulders, not daring to speak another word. How could she? These people could actually send her to jail.

Mayor George Clark beamed, his heart swelling with pride. Officers from the military academy coming to the village for development work? This was a monumental political achievement. He eagerly led Andrew Smith toward the village, chatting animatedly along the way.

Jack White kept his head down, his expression dark.

A village woman supported Luna White, sighing in pity. "Poor child. Those without parents always have the hardest lives."

Liupan Village wasn’t far from the reservoir—just a ten-minute walk.

Mayor Clark brought the group to Luna’s old family home. Unoccupied for four years, only Ethan White had bothered to tidy it up during his rare visits. The interior was barely livable, but the exterior walls were crumbling.

The mud-brick house couldn’t withstand the elements. It needed a fresh layer of mud plaster every year, but with no one to care for it, the place looked especially dilapidated. The house stood alone at the foot of the mountain, the nearest neighbor over a dozen meters away.

Andrew frowned at the heavy padlock on the door. The door itself was intact—Ethan had made repairs whenever he returned.

"Where’s the key?" Andrew demanded coldly.

Jack jerked his head up, meeting Andrew’s sharp gaze. Panic flashed across his face. "I—I’ll go find it!" He turned and bolted.

Clara had already vanished. Not a single member of the White family remained.

Mayor Clark rubbed his hands awkwardly. Dealing with such troublesome relatives was exhausting. The group stood idly outside Luna’s house.

Half an hour passed, and Jack was nowhere to be seen. The mayor’s expression grew increasingly grim.

Luna glanced at Andrew’s stern profile and knew the Whites had thoroughly humiliated themselves.

She tugged lightly on the mayor’s sleeve. "Uncle, maybe we should break the lock? We can’t keep everyone waiting forever."

The mayor hesitated. "That… doesn’t seem right. Breaking into private property is—"

"This is my home!" Luna’s voice was clear. "How is returning to my own house trespassing?"

The group finally realized—of course, this was her home!

Andrew raised a brow. The girl was sharp. How had she been bullied so badly?

"Alright!" The mayor slapped his thigh. "It’s your house—you decide!"

Jack came panting back, empty-handed.

"Mayor, I can’t find the key…" He forced a smile. "Maybe we should call it a day. Once I find it, I’ll clean up—"

Before he could finish, he noticed the odd looks everyone was giving him.

"Break it," Luna said firmly.

Jack flailed. "Luna, the lock is perfectly fine—"

Andrew waved a hand, and two cadets stepped forward with tools.

"Uncle, since you can’t find the key, breaking it is simpler." Luna moved closer to the mayor. "Next time, Grandma might not 'accidentally' hurt me—she might actually kill me." She deliberately revealed the wounds on her arm.

Andrew remembered her injuries and immediately ordered, "Get the medic. An infected wound can be fatal."

Patrick Lewis hurried off.

The mayor waved impatiently. "Enough! This was Luna’s parents’ house. If she says break it, we break it. How dare you talk about being wronged? If not for the soldiers, this child would be dead today!"

Jack retreated, his face ashen. He knew—once that door opened, the house would never be his again.

With a loud clang, the padlock fell to the ground.
###Chapter 18: The Crumbling Home

A loud bang shattered the lock. Luna White stood at the threshold, her eyes slightly red.

This was the home where she had lived for fourteen years. Weeds choked the yard, though they only reached ankle-height—clearly, her brother Ethan had come by recently to tidy up. The main door was locked tight. Luna pulled a key from around her neck—the one Ethan had given her before he left, urging her to visit when she could. But when had she ever had time? The Whites had squeezed every minute from her.

In her past life, once she left, she never returned.

The key turned, and the door creaked open. Thick dust coated the interior, settling over tables and chairs like a shroud. The sleeping mat on the kang was rolled up, and water stains from leaks marred the ceiling, dried mud streaking the table in patchy patterns.

Half the stove had collapsed, and the pots and pans had been stored away in cabinets. The water jar bore a gaping hole. The entire house felt lifeless.

The small room she had shared with her sister was even worse. Most of the wall had crumbled, leaving only the courtyard wall stubbornly standing.

With a soft creak, she pushed the door open. Cobwebs stretched across the frame, and dust swirled in the air. A rat darted past her feet, making her stumble back.

Jack White smirked. "Mayor, does this look like a place anyone could live? I’m only thinking of Luna’s well-being."

George Clark frowned. The house was indeed in ruins, and Jack’s words held some truth.

"Luna," Jack feigned concern, "come back with me. Forget the rats and spiders—what if there are snakes? I promise your grandmother won’t lay a hand on you again."

Luna shook her head, voice trembling. "Uncle, I won’t go back. I can live without a stove, but this was my parents’ home—my brother’s only home. I can’t let it rot away." She turned to the villagers and bowed deeply. "Please help me. This is all my parents left behind."

Her plea struck a chord. Who among them didn’t have children? Who wouldn’t understand a parent’s love?

Andrew Smith stepped forward. "Neighbors, let us students lead the way. Those in engineering, repairs are nothing to us." He turned to his classmates. "Split up—some fetch carts, others dig clay. We’ll fix the roof and courtyard wall by tonight!"

Mayor Clark rallied the villagers. "Don’t just stand there! Every bit of help counts. Let’s make sure this girl has a place to sleep tonight!"

The crowd sprang into action.

A medic tended to Luna’s wounds. Without anesthesia, the needle piercing her flesh sent cold sweat dripping down her back. She could have healed herself—her supernatural ability could revive the dead, though each use left her shivering as if plunged into ice.

But not today. The entire village needed to see her injuries, her pain. Only then could the Whites’ lies be exposed.

For this home, she would endure anything.
###Chapter 19: A New Home

Andrew Smith rolled up his sleeves and climbed onto the roof with practiced ease. The gaping hole in the thatch required immediate attention, and the villagers had already brought straw and clay to help with repairs. He mixed the straw into the mud, first patching the hole with wooden planks before layering on the mud mixture and finally securing the tiles in place.

Meanwhile, Luna White busied herself inside the house. The brick bed still functioned, so she cleaned it thoroughly before laying out a straw mat. Pushing open the two simple wooden windows, sunlight flooded the room, revealing its emptiness—only a wobbly table and a peeling wooden chest remained.

"Uncle Jack took all the good things," Luna muttered with a bitter smile. She opened the chest and pulled out her family's bedding, damp and musty from neglect. Carrying it outside, she found the villagers had already strung up a clothesline for her.

By sunset, the house was finally livable. As Andrew descended the ladder, Luna quickly brought him a basin of water.

"Captain Smith, wash up," she said sincerely. "Thank you for all your help today. Once the kitchen is fixed, I’ll invite everyone for a meal."

Andrew shook his wet hair, grinning. "Sounds good. I’ll bring the students to celebrate and finish the courtyard wall while we’re at it."

Mayor George Clark approached with an invitation. "Captain Smith, join us for dinner at my place."

"Another time. We need to get back to the school," Andrew replied, straightening his collar before leading his students away.

Turning to Luna, the mayor offered, "Come eat with us, girl."

"Thank you, Mayor, but I still have more to sort out here," she declined politely. Hesitating, she added, "Actually, there’s something I wanted to ask..."

George sighed. "Some matters are best left alone, child."

Luna understood he meant reclaiming what her uncle had taken. Forcing a smile, she said, "Have a safe walk home."

After seeing him off, she closed the gate. The yard was quiet except for the chirping of crickets. Taking a deep breath, she finally allowed herself to feel it—she was home.

Under the dim light, she spread out the sun-warmed bedding. The quilt still carried the day’s heat. Lying on her long-lost bed, Luna closed her eyes in contentment.

It felt good to be alive. The day’s events—her rebirth, the dangers, returning home—seemed like a dream. But the future would be brighter.

Her fingers brushed the silver needle hidden under her pillow, and a faint smile curved her lips. Tomorrow, her revenge would begin.
###Chapter 20: Between Life and Death

Luna White curled up under the blankets, her body utterly exhausted, yet sleep eluded her. Her mind replayed scenes from her past life like a relentless film reel—anger, resentment, bitterness, and her final, desperate struggle.

She clenched her fists in fury but accidentally tugged at the wound on her arm, hissing in pain.

"Now's not the time for this," she murmured to herself.

The most urgent matter was testing whether her supernatural ability still worked as it had before. Closing her eyes, she placed her uninjured right hand over the wound. A familiar warmth surged beneath her skin, swirling before gradually fading.

She didn’t dare remove the bandages. The villagers were watching. If the wound healed too quickly, suspicions would rise. As for the gash on her forehead, she decided to leave it untreated.

Then, a familiar suffocating sensation seized her. The side effects were coming. Her feet turned icy, and all sound vanished—even the barking dog next door.

Her senses dulled, her body limp as a deflated balloon. Cold seeped from her core despite the summer heat, leaving her shivering under the thick quilt. She remembered a foreign film she’d seen in her past life, where the heroine had a similar ability—except she had a love interest to keep her warm.

Luna had no one. She would endure this long night alone.

"At least... the ability is back..." Her teeth chattered, but she couldn’t help a faint smile. This time, she would save her brother and sister. She would change their fates.

There was always a price. Fate was nothing if not fair.

Dawn had broken by the time Luna finally drifted off. When she woke, her limbs were still stiff and cold, but the chill had receded. She rubbed her feet vigorously, coaxing blood back into them.

"A new day begins," she whispered, inhaling deeply.

After tidying the bedding, she pushed open the creaky wooden door. The mountain air was crisp, scented with earth and grass.

Food was the immediate concern. Mayor George Clark had promised her fifty pounds of cornmeal, but that wouldn’t last. Harvest season was near, yet her grandmother Clara White would never share the yield. And school started in September...

"The acceptance letter!" She jolted. Last time, it had been sent to her uncle’s house and hidden by Clara. She had to get it first this time.

A knock sounded at the gate.

Luna opened it to find Mayor Clark with Security Chief Paul Jackson and Women’s Committee Head Amy Miller. Jackson carried a sack of flour over his shoulder.

"Mayor, you’re here early..." Luna’s eyes reddened—not an act. She truly had nowhere left to turn.

Mayor Clark reassured her, "Don’t worry, your uncle’s family will provide their share after the harvest—"

Before he could finish, Jackson’s face drained of color. He clutched his chest and collapsed. The flour sack hit the ground with a thud, sending up a cloud of dust.

"Paul!" The mayor and Amy rushed forward.

Luna’s chest tightened. Her medical training from her past life recognized the symptoms instantly: a heart attack.

"Don’t move him!" she snapped. "It could be cardiac arrest—moving him could kill him!"

Amy grabbed her arm. "You know medicine?" Then, remembering Luna’s father had been the village doctor, she added, "I’ll fetch the doctor. Stay here!" She sprinted off.

Mayor Clark hovered helplessly. In mere moments, Jackson’s eyes rolled back, his breathing growing fainter.

Luna bit her lip. Save him or not? Using her ability meant enduring agony. But if she didn’t...

Jackson’s lips were turning blue.

"No time to wait for the doctor." Resolved, she pressed her hand discreetly against his chest.
###Chapter 21: Between Life and Death

"Quick! Lay him flat!" Luna White's voice was urgent as her fingers immediately found Paul Jackson's pulse.

George Clark fumbled to lower the man onto the stone slab at the courtyard entrance. Paul's face had turned ashen, his lips purple, his chest barely rising.

"Heart attack!" Luna's fingers twitched. "If we don't act now, it'll be too late!"

Beads of sweat rolled down George's forehead as he shakily checked Paul's breathing. "He's... not breathing!"

A scream pierced the air from outside the courtyard. Clara Clark stumbled in, her face pale. "What happened to my brother?" She lunged toward Paul, but Luna grabbed her arm.

"Don't touch him!" Luna snapped. "Moving him now could kill him!"

Clara turned on George, gripping his collar. "You said it was just a drink! How did it turn into this?"

The crowd stirred as Dr. Steven Davis was dragged into the yard by Amy Miller. Kneeling, he pressed his stethoscope to Paul's chest—then immediately paled.

"It's too late..." Dr. Davis shook his head. "A heart attack. Even if we rush him to the hospital now—"

"Bullshit!" Clara shrieked hysterically. "My brother's only forty!"

George suddenly seized Luna's wrist. "You recognized the symptoms—you must know how to help!"

Luna pressed her lips together. "I need acupuncture needles..."

"I have them!" Dr. Davis hastily opened his medical bag but lowered his voice in warning. "Girl, this isn't a game..."

Luna took the needles and scanned the crowd. "Everyone, step back. Get me a curtain."

"Move! Now!" George barked.

Within minutes, a thick cloth curtain was rigged up in the courtyard. Before stepping behind it, Luna caught fragments of murmurs:

"Can she really do this?"
"She's Dr. White's daughter—maybe she knows something..."
"What if she kills him?"

The curtain fell, shutting out all eyes. Luna took a deep breath, the silver needles glinting in her fingers.

Ten minutes later, the curtain was yanked aside. Luna emerged, her face ghostly pale, lips trembling. "He's... stable..."

Clara was the first to rush in, then burst into sobs. "Paul! You scared me half to death!"

George, eyes red, directed the others. "Quick, carry him inside!" He turned and bowed deeply to Luna. "Girl, this debt—"

Luna couldn't speak, only waving weakly. Her hands shook uncontrollably—she couldn't even hold the needles steady.

Dr. Davis took them from her, eyeing her skeptically. "He's really alive?" Without waiting for an answer, he hurried after the crowd.

The courtyard emptied in moments, leaving only Luna slumped against the wall, sliding slowly to the ground. The setting sun stretched her shadow long across the stones.
###Chapter 22 Warmth

Luna White trembled as she shut the front door, collapsing against the wall. Even wrapped tightly in a quilt, she couldn’t stop shaking. She had pushed herself too hard treating Paul Jackson—his illness had been severe, forcing her to take risks. Now, the cold had seeped into her bones, leaving her nearly frozen.

"Damn it..." Her teeth chattered, her breath visible in the frigid air.

A sudden pounding echoed at the door.

Luna didn’t even bother lifting her head. Who in their right mind would come knocking in this weather?

But the knocking persisted, relentless, as if determined to break the door down.

Gritting her teeth, she dragged herself to the entrance—just as a figure vaulted over the courtyard wall.

"What the—" Anger flared, but then she recognized him.

Andrew Smith.

The man stumbled slightly upon landing, clearly not expecting to be caught. Their eyes met, and the air between them froze.

"Luna?" Andrew rushed inside in three quick strides. "What’s wrong?"

His icy fingers brushed her forehead before jerking back.

"No fever..." he muttered, pressing a hand to his own forehead for comparison.

Luna shrank back. "I’m fine. What do you need, Captain Smith?"

Andrew’s ears reddened at his own forwardness, but the sight of her blue-tinged lips overrode his hesitation. "Do you need a hospital?"

"No." She shook her head, teeth clattering. "Just... cold."

All she wanted was a sip of hot soup. The thought alone nearly brought tears to her eyes.

Andrew frowned. "How long has this been going on?"

"J-just started..." Her voice trembled uncontrollably.

Without another word, he turned and left. Burying her face in the quilt, Luna longed for the warmth of her siblings. If they were here, they’d hold her close...

Footsteps returned.

"Drink this." Andrew crouched beside her, holding a steaming bowl.

She looked up as warmth enveloped her face. Her hands shook too much to hold the bowl, so he steadied it for her. The ginger-infused syrup slid down her throat, spreading heat through her limbs.

"Mmm..." She sighed like a contented cat.

A faint smile touched Andrew’s eyes. He pulled a hot water bottle from his coat and tucked it into her arms, carefully adjusting the quilt before heading to the kitchen.

Luna drifted off, cradling the warmth. When she awoke, the house smelled heavenly.

"Awake?" Aunt Laura entered with a bowl of noodles. "Eat while it’s hot."

Clara Clark followed, eyes red-rimmed. "This is my fault... I shouldn’t have let you exhaust yourself."

Luna stared at the two poached eggs floating in the broth. "This is too much—"

"Eat!" Clara scowled. "Compared to my brother’s life, what’s a couple of eggs?"

Aunt Laura chuckled. "Her hens lay plenty, don’t worry."

The three laughed together. Luna took small bites, warmth slowly returning to her body. Outside, the clatter of tools echoed—Andrew and his men were repairing her house.

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting dappled patterns on the floor.
###Chapter 23: Schemes

After finishing her meal, Luna White felt much better and decided to get out of bed. Stepping into the yard, she saw Andrew Smith leading a group of villagers in repairing the collapsed walls of her house. The mud bricks were neatly stacked, and even the courtyard wall had been raised by half a meter. She couldn’t help but smile.

This instructor was truly thoughtful.

Once the work was done, the villagers gradually left. Andrew washed his hands and noticed Luna leaning against the doorframe, smiling at him.

"Feeling better?" he asked, noting the healthy flush in her cheeks—her fever must have broken.

Luna nodded. "Thank you, Instructor Andrew. I really appreciate it." She meant it. In her past life, no one had ever treated her this kindly.

"Just doing my duty. Our unit is training nearby, so don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything." His gaze fell on the bandage wrapped around her arm. "Need help changing the dressing?"

"No, no!" Luna waved her hands quickly. "The aunties are helping me."

No way was she letting him see—her wound had already healed. The bandage was just for show.

"Alright. Let me know if you need anything." Andrew grinned. "Serving the people, after all."

After seeing him off, Luna exhaled deeply. What an eventful day.

She looked around and noticed the sack of cornmeal had been moved into the kitchen, the water barrel was full, and the firewood was neatly stacked. Even the furniture inside had been repaired.

She suddenly remembered she still had his hot water bottle. Well, she’d return it next time.

For the first time in a while, she felt at ease. Life didn’t seem so bad after all.

She decided to go find the mailman. Letters were rare in the village, and the mailman only came once a day at noon. If a family received a letter, it was always a big deal.

Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the White household was suffocatingly tense.

Maya White hacked at pig feed while cursing under her breath. "That wretched girl, she deserves to starve to death!" Her hands were stained with pig feed, and the stench made her want to vomit. These chores had always been Luna’s job.

Jack White and Clara White sat in the main room, faces dark with anger. Ethan and Bai Zhuang were out in the fields, but the three adults were too ashamed to step outside.

Yesterday’s incident had spread through the entire village. If they went out now, they’d be met with scornful glares. Jack had never been so humiliated in his life.

"Are we just going to let this go? That house..." Laura White ground her teeth. They had planned to sell it soon to pay for Bai Zhuang’s bride price.

Clara snorted. "She can run, but she can’t hide. After raising her all these years, it’s time she paid us back." To her, Luna was nothing more than a bargaining chip.

Jack took a deep drag from his pipe. "Mother, let’s put the house aside for now. The whole village is watching." He narrowed his eyes. "The priority is marrying that girl off. We’ll get the bride price and keep the house."

Laura’s eyes lit up. "Exactly! Find her a wealthy family—the bride price could be at least two hundred. Then the house is still ours!"

"I’ll go see the matchmaker," Clara said, standing up.

"Wait." Jack stopped her. "Have Laura check with her family first. You keep an eye on the mailman—make sure you intercept that acceptance letter."

Laura jumped to her feet eagerly. "My sister-in-law knows a few rich families who pay well!" She grinned, already picturing the money in her hands.

The family exchanged satisfied smiles, as if Luna’s fate was already sealed.
###Chapter 24: A Dog's Mouth Can't Spit Ivory

Luna White jogged to the village entrance and spotted Robert Thompson, the postman, riding his vintage bicycle with its iconic frame. The green mailbag on the rear swayed as the wheels bumped along the dirt road.

"Uncle Robert!" Luna waved vigorously.

Robert braked sharply, planting one foot on the ground, his face creasing into a grin. "Well, if it isn’t little Luna! Waiting for your acceptance letter?"

"Uncle, I need to ask you something." She panted, her cheeks flushed. "If my letter arrives, please don’t give it to my grandmother. Bring it straight to me."

Robert frowned. "What? Is Clara causing trouble again?"

"She doesn’t want me to go to college. She wants me to work instead." Luna bit her lip. "I’m afraid she’ll hide the letter."

"Outrageous!" Robert smacked his thigh in frustration. "Don’t worry, I’ll make sure it gets to you. Getting into university these days is no small feat—your grandmother’s lost her mind!"

Luna bowed repeatedly. "Thank you, Uncle!"

Watching the postman ride away, Luna exhaled in relief. Now, the most pressing matter was scraping together enough money for the trip to the provincial capital. She considered asking her sisters for help, but if that failed, she’d have to borrow from door to door.

As she turned to leave, she nearly collided with Maya White and Lisa Wilson. Maya’s eyes burned with resentment, the blisters from that morning’s scalding still throbbing.

"Well, well, if it isn’t our little scholar," Lisa sneered, blocking Luna’s path. "No greeting for your sister-in-law?"

Luna shot her a cold glare. "Move."

"You fatherless, motherless brat!" Maya shrieked. "If it weren’t for our family, you’d have starved to death!"

Lisa pretended to mediate. "Maya, don’t be like that. We’re family—"

"Family?" Maya spat. "She’s a jinx! An ungrateful wretch!"

Luna suddenly seized Maya’s wrist, squeezing hard enough to make her yelp. "Say that again."

"L-Let go!" Maya whimpered, sweat beading on her forehead.

"Yesterday, the whole village heard your father admit it—nineteen dollars fed your entire family. So who owes whom?" Luna stepped closer, her voice low. "If I hear another filthy word from your mouth, I’ll rip it to shreds."

Lisa stumbled back, startled. When had this girl become so fierce?

Maya, unable to break free, finally cowered. "F-Fine, I won’t say it again!"

Luna shoved her away and strode off without a backward glance. Behind her, Maya’s tearful curses followed: "Just you wait! My father will deal with you!"

The setting sun stretched Luna’s shadow long across the ground. She clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. In this life, no one would ever bully her again.
###Chapter 25: Shut Up

Lisa Wilson lunged forward, yanking Maya White aside as she inspected the red marks on her wrist. Turning to Luna White, she spat, "Luna, have you lost your mind? This is your own sister! So what if your siblings gave you money? Can you survive on your own? What good is money without family?"

Luna smirked, shaking off Maya’s grip. "Who do you think you are? Just because you’re engaged to Ethan, you think you can lecture me? Money means nothing?" She swept her gaze across the onlookers, raising her voice. "Ask anyone in this village—if they had this money, would they take me in?"

She stepped closer to Lisa, enunciating each word. "Meanwhile, my own grandmother and uncle took my money and left me starving and freezing. Why?" A bitter laugh escaped her. "Because your family’s dowry and bride price came straight from my pockets!"

The rush of finally speaking her truth sent a thrill through Luna. She was done swallowing her anger.

"You—you’re nothing but a shrew!" Lisa’s face flushed red. She hadn’t expected Luna to fight back like this.

"A shrew?" Luna arched a brow. "Want to see what a real shrew looks like?" She shoved Lisa aside. "Out of my way!"

Lisa staggered, tears welling up. "You’re disgusting!"

Luna didn’t even glance back. "Go ahead—give your family’s money to your uncles first, then come preach to me." She paused. "Otherwise, shut up."

Lisa gaped. Was this really the same Luna who used to let everyone walk all over her?

"She… she’s lost her mind!" Lisa turned to Maya, voice trembling.

Maya scoffed. "Oh, she’s definitely crazy! Yesterday she dragged my grandma to the reservoir, threatening to jump!" Her eyes gleamed as she leaned in. "And when they pulled her out, that soldier—"

"He kissed her?" Lisa gasped.

"Right in front of everyone!" Maya whispered dramatically. "Mouth to mouth! Who’d want her now?"

Lisa’s eyes narrowed. "If word gets out, your family’s reputation—"

Maya paled. "That jinx! Mom needs to marry her off, fast!"

"No rush." Lisa linked arms with Maya, smiling sweetly. "We’ll find her the perfect match." She lowered her voice. "I know a few men from the mountains…"

Maya brightened. "Yes! The poorer, the better! Let’s see how long she keeps acting so high and mighty!"

The two exchanged conspiratorial grins, already picturing Luna’s miserable fate.
###Chapter 26: Worth

Luna White couldn’t care less about Lisa Wilson’s meddling with Maya White. The 1980s were nothing like the old society—Clara White might be domineering, but she had no say in Luna’s marriage. Even if Jack White himself intervened, it wouldn’t matter. Freedom of marriage was written into the constitution.

No one could force her. Unless they drugged her like in her past life.

But this time, she had awakened her supernatural ability early. She’d like to see if Clara could pull the same trick again.

Returning to her courtyard, she found the lock broken from yesterday’s incident. She hadn’t replaced it yet—she couldn’t afford to. Aside from that bag of cornmeal, there was nothing of value inside. The villagers wouldn’t bother stealing from her, so she had left the gate slightly ajar.

But now, it was wide open.

Luna’s striking brows furrowed slightly. Her eyebrows were unusual—unlike most girls’, which tapered toward the ends, hers were sharply defined, like brushstrokes in calligraphy, with a slight upward tilt at the edges. They contrasted sharply with her delicate features.

Someone was in her yard.

Luna walked in without a flicker of emotion.

After dying once, what was there left to fear?

Clara Clark and Mayor George Clark were there with members of the Clark and Jackson families, hauling things around. When they spotted Luna, they froze mid-motion.

"Luna, you’re back early?"

Luna stared at the brand-new bamboo mat and low table in Clara’s hands, the new iron pot and kitchenware by the stove, the sacks of flour, fresh meat, vegetables, and eggs. She was speechless.

"Quit dawdling! Hurry up and finish!" Clara didn’t waste time, rushing over to Luna in quick strides.

"Luna, this is just a small token of our gratitude. In ancient times, saving a life would’ve meant repaying you with everything we own. Times have changed, but the sentiment’s the same. Compared to what you did for my brother, this is nothing." Clara spoke rapidly, afraid Luna might refuse.

Last night, the old patriarch had made his stance clear: This girl is extraordinary.

After they’d taken Paul Jackson to the county hospital for a full checkup, the doctor had been baffled. "What exactly are you here for? This man’s in perfect health—full of energy. Why waste a hospital visit?"

Paul had been just as confused. He’d had high blood pressure and mild cerebral thrombosis. During his New Year’s checkup, the doctor had explicitly told him the conditions could only be managed, not cured.

Yet after Luna revived him, he hadn’t even taken his blood pressure medication. By all logic, he should’ve been dizzy and weak by now.

"Doctor, are you sure there’s nothing wrong?"

The doctor had laughed. "You’re a funny one. Most people pray they’re healthy, but you’re hoping for an illness?"

"But the high blood pressure, the thrombosis, the risk of heart attack—"

"Relax! You’re in better shape than a twenty-year-old. Perfect blood pressure, clean brain scans, flawless ECG. At this rate, you’ll live to a hundred."

Paul had bolted back to the village like he’d seen a ghost, leaving his sister, wife, and kids behind at the hospital.

"That girl’s a miracle worker!" he’d exclaimed the moment he stepped through the door.

After hearing the full story, the old patriarch had simply said, "She’s a divine healer. We must look out for her from now on."

Clara and George hadn’t slept all night. Being able to cure illnesses was one thing, but bringing someone back from the brink of death and erasing years of chronic conditions? That was something else entirely.

It was easy to add flowers to a brocade, but hard to send charcoal in the snow. Right now, Luna was at her lowest. Befriending her now might mean saving their own lives someday.

At dawn, the two families had sprung into action. The Clarks and Jacksons were influential in the village, with dozens of relatives between them. Now, all of them were bustling around Luna’s courtyard.

"Thank you, Auntie." Luna didn’t refuse.

Clara beamed. "That’s more like it! From now on, you’re family—our daughter, niece, whatever you want to call it. If anyone dares bully you, we’ll break their legs!"

"Yes!" the crowd chorused.

The courtyard buzzed with laughter and chatter, lively and warm.

A faint smile touched Luna’s lips.

People had to prove their worth, after all.
###Chapter 27: Housewarming Feast

Luna White insisted on keeping Mayor George Clark and Clara Clark's families for dinner. With the ingredients they'd brought, she swiftly prepared a lavish spread.

"Auntie, may I borrow your table?" Luna efficiently borrowed a small round table from the neighbor, along with a few stools. The dishes and utensils were also gathered from nearby households.

Two tables were set up beneath the jujube tree. George and Clara Clark gaped at the feast before them.

"This girl can really cook?" they exchanged glances, silently impressed by how well Jack White had raised his daughter.

Paul Jackson stared at the braised pork, swallowing hard. "Uncle, let me fetch you some liquor!"

George smacked the back of his head. "More like you want a drink, eh?"

Clara chuckled and pulled out two dollars. "Go buy two jugs of rice wine and two bottles of liquor. Don’t waste Luna’s hard work."

Paul snatched the money and dashed off.

The kitchen wafted with mouthwatering aromas. Clara stood at the doorway, rubbing her hands. "Luna, don’t overdo it. These were meant for you, not us!"

Luna emerged with a large bowl, flour dusting her cheeks. "Auntie, there’s another bowl inside. Bring it out—one for each table, fair and square!"

"My, your skills outshine even the village chefs!" Clara praised.

Luna smiled faintly. "Keep flattering me, and I’ll get a big head."

Just then, Paul came rushing back—with two others in tow.

"Captain Andrew!" George stood quickly. "Perfect timing for the housewarming! Have a seat!"

Andrew Smith handed Luna rice wine, canned goods, and powdered milk. "A small token."

She accepted graciously. "Then I won’t stand on ceremony." She carried the gifts inside.

Clara hurried to set extra plates while George poured Andrew a drink.

"Regulations forbid alcohol," Andrew declined politely.

George laughed. "Rice wine doesn’t count! Just a sip."

Seeing Andrew’s resolve, George didn’t press further.

When Luna returned, she found Andrew seated beside her. She sat down without a word.

Andrew tried a slice of boiled pork and brightened. This was better than the army mess hall’s cooking!

Luna raised her rice wine and stood. "Thank you all for celebrating my new home. Bottoms up!" She downed it in one go.

"Bravo!" George slammed the table. "If a lady can finish hers, we men can’t back down!" He chugged a full bowl of liquor.

"Luna, I owe you an apology." George’s face flushed. "From now on, if you need anything, come to me. I won’t let that grandmother of yours bully you again!"

It was the first time the mayor had taken her side so openly. Luna thanked him with a smile.

As the feast wore on, every dish was devoured—not a drop of broth remained.

Clara clung to Luna’s hand. "Come to us anytime you need help!"

Between bites, Andrew stole glances at Luna. Despite the praise, her expression never wavered.

Once everyone had eaten their fill, George and the others were too drunk to walk straight. Andrew and his student helped carry them home.

As Luna cleared the dishes, a pair of strong hands suddenly reached for the stack.

"Captain Andrew, you don’t have to—" she protested.

He stacked the plates efficiently. "Many hands make light work." His student quietly joined in.

Under the setting sun, their three shadows stretched long across the yard.
###Chapter 28: Uninvited Guests

Luna White was washing dishes with her head bowed when Andrew Smith efficiently wiped the tables and chairs until they gleamed, stacking them neatly to the side. They couldn’t identify which neighbors had lent the furniture, so they had to leave it there for Luna to return later.

"Let me help." Andrew picked up a dry cloth and took the freshly washed dishes from Luna, carefully drying them.

His student had already volunteered to fetch water for her. After enjoying such a delicious meal, it felt wrong to leave without contributing. Besides, Andrew had paid for everything himself—not pitching in would have made them feel like they were taking advantage of the young woman.

"You came to celebrate my new home and even brought gifts. Now you’re helping me with chores—I really shouldn’t impose," Luna said, rubbing her hands awkwardly.

Andrew watched his student walk away and smiled faintly. "That kid’s sharp. Don’t say such formal things. Saving you that day was fate—otherwise, I’d never have met such a talented young woman."

Luna chuckled. "Andrew, you’re giving me too much credit. By the way, I’ve cleaned the hot water bottle and the clothes you wore when you rescued me. You can take them back later so they don’t go to waste."

"Alright." He nodded, then asked with concern, "Are you feeling better? If you’re still unwell, you should see a doctor. The village clinic’s resources are limited—someone as young as you shouldn’t neglect their health."

Luna rinsed the last few dishes and tossed the remaining water into the yard. The sweltering afternoon instantly felt cooler.

"It’s an old issue—I’ve always had cold hands and feet. It’s nothing serious."

Andrew frowned disapprovingly. "You still shouldn’t take it lightly."

"Yes, sir!" Luna teased, giving a playful salute.

Andrew shook his head helplessly and stacked the dried dishes.

"Well, well, Luna, you’ve got company?" A shrill voice suddenly cut in.

Luna looked up to see Maya White and her brother standing at the gate. Maya’s eyes were locked onto Andrew, burning with undisguised interest.

"Who’s this gentleman? Aren’t you going to introduce us?" Maya practically skipped over to Andrew. "I’m Maya, Luna’s cousin. And this is my brother."

Andrew took a subtle step back. These must be the relatives Luna had mentioned—the ones from her uncle’s family. From their brief conversations, he knew Luna’s real brother was in the military, and this rough-looking country boy clearly wasn’t him.

"Hello. I’m Andrew Smith."

"Oh!" Maya clapped her hands dramatically. "So you’re the Andrew who saved Luna and kissed her?"

The moment the words left her mouth, both Luna and Andrew’s expressions darkened.

"Maya." Andrew’s voice turned icy. "That was CPR—a life-saving measure. Luna had stopped breathing. If I hadn’t acted, your grandmother might be in prison right now."

His entire demeanor sharpened. "I suggest you refrain from slandering a soldier’s reputation. The entire village can attest to what happened. If you continue spreading lies, I’ll have no choice but to report you for defamation."

Maya paled. She knew the consequences—a neighbor from the next village had been jailed for spreading rumors about a soldier. She had no intention of following suit.

"Andrew, I—I didn’t mean anything by it!" she stammered, forcing a smile. "I’m just ignorant. Please don’t take it to heart..."

Andrew scoffed. Just then, his student returned with the water, giving him the perfect excuse to leave. "We should get going. Thank you for the meal, Luna. Please pass my gratitude to the mayor for his hospitality."

It was a graceful exit—and a way to shut the cousins up. Fetching his clothes and the hot water bottle now would only fuel more gossip.

"Of course. Take care, Andrew." Luna nodded in understanding.

Andrew strode away with his student. Maya pouted, disappointed that such an impressive man had no interest in her advances.

Once they were out of earshot, her brother stepped forward. "Luna, why did you bully Lisa today?"

So this was about that. Luna nearly laughed. She’d barely said a word—was Lisa really that fragile?

"I didn’t bully her. Why don’t you bring her here so we can talk face-to-face?"

Her brother’s eyes bulged. "Luna, you’ve gotten bold, haven’t you? Even if your brother sent money, don’t forget who raised you! This isn’t about money—it’s about family!"

Luna smirked coldly. "I never knew you were so eloquent. If family matters so much, why didn’t any of you save me a bite at dinner? Why didn’t you let me sleep in when we worked? When Grandma hit me, where was your 'family' then?"

Her gaze turned razor-sharp. "Tell your precious Lisa this: stay out of my way. If she provokes me, she’ll regret it."
###Chapter 29: Counterattack

Bai Zhuang's temper flared instantly, and he raised his hand to strike a slap. In his eyes, a disobedient younger sister like this deserved a harsh lesson.

Raised under Jack White's strict discipline and Clara White's constant reinforcement, he firmly believed that "spare the rod, spoil the child." His impression of Luna White had always been that of a pitiful girl who endured beatings and insults in silence, shedding quiet tears.

But this time, Luna was prepared. She sidestepped the blow effortlessly.

She would never be a helpless victim again.

Grabbing the carrying pole leaning against the wall—left there by Andrew Smith's student after fetching water—she wielded it as her weapon.

"Remember, hitting a woman comes with consequences. Now get out!" Luna's voice was ice-cold.

She knew she wasn't skilled in fighting—she had never thrown a punch in either of her lifetimes. But she understood one thing clearly: if she didn't stand her ground now, every member of the White family would trample over her in the future.

Bai Zhuang trembled with rage. In the White household, aside from Jack White, he held the most authority. None of his younger siblings dared defy him. His fists were his law.

"Luna, you’ve lost your mind!" Bai Zhuang roared. "Lay a finger on me, and I’ll beat you to death!"

To him, Luna would always be that weakling who could be bullied at will.

Thwack!

The pole came down hard on Bai Zhuang’s back. Luna swung with all her strength—the force of the pole far exceeded that of a bare fist. Caught off guard, Bai Zhuang crashed to the ground.

What followed was like opening Pandora’s box. Luna rained blows on Bai Zhuang—his arms, his legs—leaving angry red welts and swollen ridges across his skin.

"You wanted to kill me? Come on then!" Luna shouted between strikes. "Today, one of us dies!"

Bai Zhuang scrambled away in terror. It wasn’t that he couldn’t fight back—it was the sheer ferocity in Luna’s eyes that paralyzed him. The murderous glint left no doubt that she would drag him down with her if necessary.

"Help! She’s trying to kill me!" Bai Zhuang wailed.

Maya White had already fled. She had egged her brother on, never expecting Luna to turn so vicious. If anything happened to Bai Zhuang, Jack White would skin her alive.

"Murder! Someone help!" Maya’s shrieks pierced the night.

When the villagers arrived, they found chaos: Luna, disheveled and gripping the pole; Bai Zhuang, bruised and battered; the courtyard in complete disarray.

Mayor George Clark rushed over, still in his slippers, and snatched the pole from Luna’s hands. "Girl, give that to me!"

Luna’s body shook violently, her legs nearly giving way, but the neighbor women steadied her.

"Uncle, you have to stand up for me!" Bai Zhuang sobbed. "She tried to kill me!"

The White family arrived in a frenzy. Clara White threw herself over her son, wailing, while Jack White’s face darkened like a storm cloud.

Clara lunged at Luna, claws outstretched. "You little witch, how dare you hit my son!" Several women held her back.

"Mrs. White, let’s hear the full story first," said Clara Clark, the mayor’s wife, stepping between them. "Violence won’t solve anything."

Clara White screeched, "Look at this! This brat has gone rogue! She needs to be handed over to the police!"

Luna watched the spectacle with cold detachment, a faint smirk curling her lips. She knew—the real battle had only just begun.
###Chapter 30: Confrontation

Jack White cleared his throat loudly, cutting off Clara White before she could speak.

"Mom, let's talk this through calmly. No need to scare the child," Jack said smoothly, earning approving nods from the villagers. He had always been well-liked in the community.

Turning to Luna, he put on a pained expression. "Luna, I know life hasn’t been fair to you. I didn’t protect you when Grandma hit you, and I wasn’t aware of the living expenses issue. But I’ve always treated you well, haven’t I? Your brother has a temper, but you can’t seriously mean to kill him!" He clutched his chest dramatically, playing the role of a heartbroken elder.

Ethan White trembled, gripping Jack’s sleeve. "Dad! That little witch tried to kill me! She really did!"

Jack nearly kicked his cowardly son in frustration. What kind of man cowered before a girl?

"Nonsense! She’s your sister!" he scolded, deliberately emphasizing the word "kill" to frame Luna for attempted murder.

Ethan stammered. He couldn’t very well admit he’d attacked her first and gotten beaten in return. Spotting Lisa Wilson in the crowd, he straightened up. "Her? Kill me? Don’t be ridiculous! I was just teasing her!"

Jack nearly fainted from rage.

"What really happened?" he demanded sharply.

Ethan finally regained his senses. "This brat bullied Lisa, so I went to confront her. She had the nerve to say, 'Don’t mess with me.' After all Grandma and Dad have done for her, she claims she’s not even part of this family! I lost my temper and tried to teach her a lesson, but she grabbed a pole and beat me with it!" He rolled up his sleeves. "Look at these bruises! She even threatened to take me down with her! Mayor, send her to the police station before she kills someone!"

Jack suppressed a smirk. Now he had justification—Luna had struck first.

"Luna, what happened between you and Lisa?" he asked with feigned concern.

Maya quickly chimed in, "Lisa tried to give Luna some advice today, but Luna insulted her and made her cry. My brother just stepped in to—"

Jack sighed heavily. "Ah, I’ve failed as a guardian." His words were deliberately vague.

Mayor George Clark turned to Luna. "Young lady, tell us your side."

Jack seethed inwardly. The mayor clearly didn’t trust his children!

Clara jumped in. "Mayor! You can’t just take her word for it! She’s the one who attacked first! If she dares to hit her own family, what won’t she do? You must stand up for us!" She was practically salivating at the thought of crushing Luna.

"Enough!" George slammed the table. "We’ll hear both sides! Or does my authority mean nothing here?" His outburst silenced Clara instantly.

"Anyone else have something to say? If not, no one interrupts when I ask questions!" George scanned the crowd, and the scene fell dead silent.

"Luna, speak."

Luna took a deep breath and stepped forward. "Uncle, I demand to confront Lisa. Ethan accused me of bullying his sweetheart. I want to know—how exactly did I bully her?"

Lisa, hiding in the crowd, paled. She’d deliberately let Ethan see her tear-stained eyes earlier but had said nothing. Now everything was ruined.

Forced into the spotlight, she stammered, "Luna, you’re lying. I never told Ethan anything." She cast a pitiful glance at Ethan.

Ethan immediately defended her. "Lisa didn’t say a word! Stop twisting things!"

Luna smirked. "Ethan, that’s not what you claimed earlier. If I bullied her, let her explain how."

Lisa twisted her fingers in her dress. "Luna didn’t... didn’t bully me. It was my own... fault..." Her words only made it sound like she was hiding something.

"All I said was, 'Don’t think everyone’s a fool,'" Luna declared clearly. "Your family used my siblings’ money to arrange marriages. Without my nineteen dollars every month, where would the dowries come from? Was I wrong?"

Lisa’s face drained of color. She cursed Ethan a thousand times in her head.

The villagers erupted in murmurs. Yesterday, they’d gossiped about the nineteen dollars—now they understood. The Whites had mistreated Luna because they didn’t want to lose their cash cow!
###Chapter 31: The Secret of Her Origins

"Did everyone hear that clearly?" Luna White's lips curled into a cold smile as her gaze swept over the gathered villagers. "My dear brother here wasn’t standing up for Lisa at all—he was just furious because I exposed his true intentions. Too bad for him, I won’t stand there and take a beating this time."

Ethan White trembled with rage, jabbing a finger at Luna. "You little brat, are you asking for death?"

"Oh, come now, brother," Luna feigned surprise, blinking innocently. "Didn’t you say it yourself? You told me to try hitting you if I dared. I was just following orders." She turned to the crowd, her voice crisp. "Uncles and aunties, tell me—have you ever heard such a strange request before?"

Mayor George Clark nearly laughed aloud. The girl had become sharp-tongued, effortlessly provoking Ethan into a frenzy.

"Bullshit!" Ethan roared. "You were trying to kill me!"

Luna’s smile widened, though her eyes remained icy. "Spending my money, yet daring to come here and hit me? Ethan, do you really think I’m a fool?" Her voice suddenly sharpened. "My brother and sister send nineteen dollars every month—enough for fine flour every meal. But what do I get? Dishwater!"

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

"Where did the rest of the money go?" Luna pressed forward relentlessly. "You’re about to get married. The Wilsons demand a dowry of two hundred dollars, plus three modern appliances. Didn’t Uncle Jack say the family was poor? Where did this money come from?"

"Good heavens!" a villager gasped. "That dowry’s richer than a city girl’s!"

"Jack White must be rolling in cash!"

"Of course he is—it’s not his money he’s spending!"

Whispers spread like wildfire. Jack’s face darkened, while Clara White glared at Amy Miller, the women’s director, her eyes filled with warning.

Tears welling, Amy stepped forward. "Luna, dear... there’s something I must tell you—"

Clara seized her wrist. "Amy! Think carefully. Speaking up won’t benefit anyone!" she hissed. "This girl has a temper. Who knows what she’ll do if she finds out?"

Luna’s heart pounded. So that was it! No wonder, in her past life, Amy had slipped her money the night before her wedding, whispering, "It’s my fault you’re suffering."

"Aunt Amy," Luna met the woman’s eyes squarely. "Were you going to say... I’m not a White by blood?"

The words exploded like a bomb among the onlookers.

Clara paled. "Nonsense! You’re our flesh and blood!"

Amy flinched. "Luna, I—I don’t know anything—"

"Then why are you afraid to speak?" Luna challenged.

Silence fell. Every breath was held, waiting for the next act of this unfolding drama.

Clara abruptly changed tactics. "Luna, your brother was wrong today. But you are a White! If you weren’t, would your siblings send money every month?"

Luna scoffed. To hide the truth, the old woman would even say that.

"Fine," she countered smoothly. "If we’re family, then return what’s mine. Twenty dollars—for food and supplies. Grandma, surely you won’t claim to be broke?"

Under the weight of the villagers’ stares, Clara’s face twisted between fury and humiliation...


###Chapter 32: Compensation

Clara White trembled with rage. Twenty dollars! Why didn’t that wretched girl Luna just drop dead?

She should have drowned in the reservoir back then.

Now, this troublemaker had the nerve to twist the knife in her heart.

But with dozens of eyes watching—especially Amy Miller’s knowing gaze—she didn’t dare refuse. If she did, Amy would surely expose that secret right then and there.

George Clark, the mayor, watched Clara’s gritted teeth with cold amusement. This old hag needed to be put in her place. Time to turn up the heat.

"Clara White, Luna is your own granddaughter. You’ve taken her living expenses for years—what’s twenty dollars now?" George deliberately raised his voice. "Unless you’d rather we calculate exactly how much you owe her?"

Clara’s chest heaved, her nails digging into her palms. "Fine! I’ll pay! Who says I wouldn’t give my own granddaughter money?"

Satisfied, George turned to Jack White. "Return everything that belongs to Luna’s family. And Ethan—pay for what he broke. The whole village is watching."

Jack’s face darkened. This was a complete disaster.

But what could he do? Expose Luna’s true parentage here? The villagers would tear him apart. Who knew this quiet girl could bite so hard?

"Don’t worry, Mayor. We’ll compensate her," Jack ground out. "But some of her parents’ things… they’re long gone—"

Luna scoffed. Her parents had been the most hardworking couple in the village. Their furniture was made of the finest wood—how could it all disappear? But arguing now was pointless. The priority was getting the money.

"Just return what you can, Uncle," she said flatly.

Jack shot Ethan a glare. "Clean up your sister’s yard. Now!"

Ethan and Maya scrambled to obey, cursing Luna silently.

Before leaving, George made sure to tell Luna, "Collect that twenty dollars. If anyone gives you trouble, come straight to me."

Clara shot Luna a venomous look and stormed off.

As the crowd dispersed, Mrs. Taylor and Amy stayed behind to comfort Luna.

Luna studied Amy discreetly. In her past life, she’d thought Amy was just kind to everyone. Now, she recognized something hidden in those gentle eyes.

But why had Amy encouraged her to run from the arranged marriage instead of revealing the truth? The secret must be even darker than she’d imagined.

Alone, Luna sat on the doorstep, staring blankly. Ethan and Maya had done a half-hearted job—broken shards still littered the ground.

She rubbed her temples. Too many mysteries. Clara and Jack clearly knew about her origins, but what about her sisters?

Thinking of Iris and her eldest sister, Luna’s heart warmed. They’d always slipped her money despite their in-laws’ disapproval.

This time, she’d protect them.

But she couldn’t leave yet. Her Acceptance Letter hadn’t arrived. She had to stay vigilant against Clara’s schemes.

Luna clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

This time, history wouldn’t repeat itself.
###Chapter 33: The Mask Comes Off

The scorching sun beat down as Clara White trudged home from the fields, her steps heavy. Nothing had gone right these past few days, and frustration simmered inside her, leaving her spirit wilted.

But farm work couldn’t wait—her family depended on these few acres to survive.

Ethan’s monthly money order still hadn’t arrived.

What gnawed at her most was Luna’s university acceptance letter. That ungrateful girl had ambitions too big for her station. If she really got into college, she’d fly far beyond their reach.

No. Absolutely not. Luna would never leave this village. Even if she rotted, it would be in this dirt!

Clara’s eyes narrowed, and she veered onto the main road. In the distance, she spotted Robert Thompson, the mailman, pedaling toward her on his bicycle. She had timed this perfectly—everyone knew Robert passed by at this hour.

"Mr. Thompson, any mail for us?" She hurried forward, her gaze darting to his mailbag. For four years, she had waited for that money order.

Robert flipped through the letters, then paused. Luna’s acceptance letter! Sixpan Village was about to have its first university student.

"There’s an acceptance letter for Luna White. No money order this month," he said, already tucking the letter back into his bag.

Clara clamped a hand over the mailbag. "Just give it to me. I’m her grandmother!" Her heart pounded—finally, she had it.

Robert frowned. "This is registered mail. It has to be signed for in person." He remembered Luna’s specific instructions.

"I’m her blood kin!" Clara snapped.

"Rules are rules." Robert pushed off on his bike.

Clara yanked the handlebars with such force that he nearly toppled over.

"What the hell?!" Robert jumped off, his face pale with shock.

Clara forced a smile. "Mr. Thompson, I’m just anxious. Be reasonable—would an old woman like me harm her own granddaughter?" Her grip on the bike was ironclad. She wouldn’t let go without that letter.

Robert pried at her fingers. "Let go, or I won’t be polite!"

"You won’t give it to me?" Clara’s expression twisted. She seized Robert’s wrist and shrieked, "Help! Robert Thompson is assaulting me!"

The accusation sent terror through Robert. He struggled, but the old woman’s grip was shockingly strong.

"Are you insane? Let go!" Sweat beaded on his forehead. A charge like that could ruin him.

"Give it to me!" Clara’s face flushed crimson with fury.

Robert glanced around frantically. If anyone saw this, his reputation would be destroyed.

"Fine! Fine, take it!" he spat through gritted teeth.

Clara released one hand. "No tricks, or I’ll throw myself at you right here!"

Robert trembled with rage as he fumbled through his bag. Clara watched like a hawk, distrustful of every movement.

"Found it yet?" she demanded impatiently.

Robert’s fingers brushed the envelope, his heart heavy. Luna had worked so hard—and now it would all be for nothing.

"Here!" He thrust it at her.

Clara snatched it and tucked it into her pocket triumphantly. "Our family business is none of your concern!" Shouldering her hoe, she hummed a tune as she marched back toward the village.

Robert stared after her, then spat on the ground. "Disgraceful."
###Chapter 34: The Midnight Heist

Luna White had barely taken two steps when she suddenly felt the ground give way beneath her. Clara White stumbled and crashed heavily onto the dirt road.

"Ouch—"

A shadow darted past. Luna lunged forward with feline grace, pressing her fingers against the old woman’s nape. With a precise pinch, Clara went limp, collapsing like a ragdoll.

"Got it!"

Luna swiftly retrieved an envelope from Clara’s coat. The gilded words "Air Force Aviation University" shimmered under the sunlight. Her fingers trembled slightly.

This wasn’t her dream school. Back when filling out applications, her homeroom teacher had chosen this military academy for her—full tuition waiver, plus a stipend. For a family as poor as the Whites, it was like winning the lottery.

Anywhere is better than this hellhole. Luna bit her lip.

In those days, college applications were a blind gamble. You submitted your choices before even knowing your scores. Dreams were shattered, hopes misplaced. But for Luna, this slip of paper was her lifeline.

"A soldier’s life? Could be worse." She smirked bitterly and tucked the acceptance letter into her inner pocket.

When she looked up, she met the stunned gaze of Robert Thompson. Luna winked. "Uncle Robert, you saw nothing, right?"

The old mailman shook his head and hurried away on his bicycle. That girl’s ruthless—the old lady took quite a fall. But… serves her right.

Luna glanced at Clara’s unconscious form, her lips curling into a cold smile.

She’d used a little trick—reversing her healing ability. It was a secret she’d discovered in her past life: the same power that mended could also break.

"Consider yourself lucky I didn’t paralyze you." She nudged Clara’s leg with her foot before turning toward home.

She needed to pack. Tomorrow, she’d visit Iris and Maya, then send a telegram to Ethan—no way would she let that family leech off them anymore!

At Mayor George Clark’s house, the lights blazed bright.

"A college student? Really?" Clara Clark snatched the acceptance letter, her hands shaking. "George! Our village is going to be famous!"

George rubbed his hands excitedly. "We’re throwing a feast! Three days straight! Let every village for miles know Six-Pan Village has produced a scholar!"

Luna waved her hands hastily. "No, no, if my grandmother finds out, she’ll raise hell."

"She wouldn’t dare!" The mayor slammed the table. "You’re the pride of this village now! Anyone who messes with you answers to me!"

Luna lowered her head to hide a smirk. Perfect. With the mayor’s backing, that old hag wouldn’t stand a chance.

Night deepened. Luna clutched the letter in her pocket, her heart pounding.

This time, no one would steal her future.
###Chapter 35: The Revelation

Luna White kept her head down, fingers clutching the hem of her shirt. "Uncle, this... is too much trouble for you. I don’t even know how to repay you."

Clara Clark pulled Luna into a tight embrace, patting her back gently. "Silly girl, stop talking nonsense! From now on, if you need anything, just ask. Our Liupan Village has your back!" She paused, her voice firm. "Remember—we don’t go looking for trouble, but we won’t let anyone push us around either."

Luna’s eyes reddened slightly as she carefully tucked her Acceptance Letter into a hidden pocket sewn inside her undergarments, secured with a safety pin.

Just as she reached the courtyard gate, she nearly collided with Lily Clark, the mayor’s daughter. As they passed each other, Lily sneered, "Stop pretending!"

Clara quickly smoothed things over. "Don’t mind her—she’s in a bad mood today."

But Luna suddenly tugged at Clara’s sleeve, lowering her voice. "Auntie... there’s something you should know. Please don’t be angry."

She remembered clearly—in her past life, this was the year Lily had gotten involved with Harold Martin, a factory worker from town. When Lily became pregnant, Harold’s mother had seized the opportunity to demand marriage without paying a single cent in dowry. Stubborn and desperate, Lily had secretly gone to an underground clinic for an abortion—and never came out alive.

Just now, when they brushed past each other, Luna’s Supernatural Ability had already sensed the tiny life inside Lily—barely three weeks old.

"Auntie... I think Lily might be pregnant," Luna whispered, her voice almost inaudible. "You need to keep an eye on her. Don’t let her do anything reckless."

Clara froze as if struck by lightning, her fingers digging into Luna’s arm unconsciously. Only when Luna gasped in pain did she snap out of it and let go.

"How... how do you know?" Clara’s voice trembled.

"Take her to a proper hospital for a checkup," Luna said, rubbing her reddened wrist. "Whatever you do, don’t let her go to one of those back-alley clinics. It could cost her life."

Clara’s face turned deathly pale. Now that she thought about it, Lily had been complaining about nausea lately, often retching for no reason...

"Luna, this matter..." Clara’s lips quivered, her words stumbling.

"I don’t know anything," Luna said firmly. "Go check on Lily."

Watching Luna leave, Clara suddenly spun around and stormed back into the courtyard, slamming the gate shut behind her.

Lily was hurrying toward the house, one hand clamped over her mouth, when her mother yanked her back.

"Mom! What are you doing?!" Lily struggled, her face ashen.

Without a word, Clara dragged her daughter inside. George Clark, hearing the commotion, rushed over to intervene. "Honey, talk to her properly—"

"Talk? Talk about what?!" Clara shoved Lily onto the bed, her entire body shaking. "You’re going to tell me the truth—whose bastard is this?"

George stiffened in shock.

Lily clutched her stomach in horror, her voice cracking. "H-how did you know?"

(To be continued...)
###Chapter 36: Confrontation

"Lily! Tell me the truth! Is what your mother said true?" Mayor George Clark slammed his hand on the table, sending tea splashing across the floor. He couldn't believe his beloved daughter would do such a thing.

Lily Clark bit her lip hard, her fingers twisting the hem of her dress until her knuckles turned white.

Clara Clark grabbed a broom and swung it at her daughter. "I'll beat some sense into you, you shameless girl!" The broom whistled through the air, but Lily stood motionless, taking the blows without flinching.

"Enough!" George snatched the broom away. "Will beating her solve anything? We need to think of a solution!"

Clara collapsed onto the floor, wailing and slapping her thighs. "What sin have I committed? Our family's reputation is ruined! The whole village will laugh at us!" She suddenly lunged at Lily. "Your brothers haven't even married yet! How can they hold their heads high now?"

Lily finally looked up, tears streaming down her face. Regret flooded her—how could she have believed Harold Martin's sweet words? That scoundrel had promised to propose within days.

"Mom... it's... it's Harold from the Martin family..." Lily's voice was barely a whisper.

Clara sprang to her feet, ready to storm out, but George yanked her back. "Are you insane? If you cause a scene at the Martins', the whole village will know!"

"Then what do we do?" Clara's eyes burned with fury. "Let that bastard get away with this?"

George's face darkened. "Tomorrow, I'll take Lily to town to confront Harold. He must take responsibility!"

Lily trembled. What if Harold denied everything? She couldn't bear to think about it.

Just then, the courtyard gate rattled under furious pounding.

"Luna White! Get out here!" Clara White's shrill voice pierced through the door. "Everyone, come see this ungrateful granddaughter who dares to hit her own grandmother!"

Luna opened the door leisurely, feigning surprise. "Grandma, what's wrong?"

Clara seized Luna's arm, her nails digging deep into the flesh. "Don't play innocent! You're the one who knocked me out!" She turned to the gathered villagers. "Look at this bump on my head—this wretched girl did it!"

Luna pulled free, rubbing her bruised arm. "Grandma, if you accuse me of hitting you, where's the proof? You can't just slander me without evidence."

"You—!" Clara trembled with rage. "You stole the—" She choked back her words.

Luna raised an eyebrow. "Stole what? Do tell, Grandma."

Fiona Turner quickly intervened. "Luna, even if your grandmother misunderstood, you shouldn't—"

"Aunt Fiona," Luna smirked, "evidence matters. Just like if I said this injury on my head was from Grandma, would you believe me?"

Clara's face turned ashen. She knew Luna was guilty, but she had no proof. That damned acceptance letter was surely in Luna's hands by now.

The old woman's chest heaved violently before her eyes rolled back, and she collapsed stiffly to the ground.
###Chapter 37: The Sudden Betrothal

"Oh my heavens!" Clara White clutched the lump on her forehead, plopping onto the ground with a dramatic wail. "Everyone, come see how my own granddaughter has beaten her poor old grandmother!"

The gathered villagers exchanged uneasy glances. Someone murmured, "Aunt Clara, are you sure it was Luna? She just came from the mayor's house."

"Exactly," another chimed in. "Luna wouldn’t even step on an ant. How could she hit someone?"

Clara stomped her foot in frustration. "Don’t believe me? Robert Thompson was at the village entrance—he must have seen it!"

Luna lingered at the edge of the crowd, a faint smirk playing on her lips. The old woman was truly desperate if she thought Robert would back her up. After threatening him just yesterday, did she really expect his help today?

"What’s all this commotion now?" Mayor George Clark pushed through the crowd, his expression dark, followed by his weary wife, Clara Clark. The couple had been dealing with enough family drama lately, and Clara White’s theatrics only worsened their moods.

Clara White pointed at her forehead, tears and snot running down her face. "Mayor, you be the judge! This lump is from that wretched Luna!"

George scoffed. "Aunt Clara, you should be careful with such accusations. Everyone knows Luna is the gentlest soul in the village. If anything, I’d believe you hit her!"

The sharp remark made Clara’s face turn ashen. Sensing the tension, her daughter-in-law, Amy Miller, stepped forward to mediate. "Mayor, my mother-in-law is getting on in years—she might have been mistaken." Then, with a calculated shift, she turned to Luna. "Oh, Luna, come home for lunch today. Your in-laws are visiting to discuss the marriage arrangements."

"Marriage?" Luna arched a brow. "Since when do I have in-laws?"

Amy smiled slyly. "It’s a betrothal your parents arranged before they passed. The groom’s family has come to formalize it."

Luna’s lips curled coldly. In her past life, this so-called "wonderful match" hadn’t surfaced for another two years. It seemed her rebirth had accelerated many events. Were the Whites so desperate to trap her now?

"I won’t marry," Luna stated flatly.

"What?" Clara White shrieked, leaping to her feet. "A child has no say in marriage—it’s the parents’ decision!"

Whispers rippled through the crowd. In the rural 1980s, parental authority still dictated such matters. But Luna was the village’s only university student—no one dared take sides rashly.

"I said no," Luna repeated, each word deliberate. "If you’re so eager, marry him yourself."

Clara trembled with rage, jabbing a finger at Luna. "You ungrateful wretch! If your parents knew—"

"If my parents knew how you’ve treated me," Luna cut in icily, "they’d rise from their graves in fury!"

Gasps erupted. No one had expected the usually meek Luna to stand her ground so fiercely. Mayor George studied her resolute profile, struck by the sudden change in her. Something about her was different—unshakable.
###Chapter 38: I'll Marry Her

"I won't marry him!" Luna White's voice rang out clear and sharp, cutting through the murmuring crowd like a blade. "When my parents died four years ago, I was only fourteen. Did anyone in this village ever see these so-called in-laws? Now that they've heard I got into university, they suddenly show up to claim me. I refuse this arrangement!"

She stood tall in the center of the courtyard, sunlight dancing across her defiant features. The gathered villagers whispered among themselves, many nodding in agreement.

"The girl has a point," muttered Aunt Elizabeth Wright under her breath. "Disappearing for four years and only coming back now—clearly, they just want a university-educated daughter-in-law."

Clara White's beady eyes narrowed as she screeched, "What do you know, you little brat? The whole village saw you being held by a man at the reservoir! You should be grateful anyone would take you now, yet here you are, acting picky!"

Her words doused the crowd like cold water. Several young wives covered their mouths, their eyes darting toward Luna.

"That's right..." one of them tugged at her husband's sleeve. "When Instructor Andrew gave her mouth-to-mouth, the scene was..."

Luna clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. Before she could respond, Clara Clark, the mayor's wife, pushed forward. "Auntie, that’s unfair. If you hadn’t pushed Luna into the water, none of this would’ve happened. Now you’re blaming her? How cruel can you be?"

The crowd erupted. Some recalled Clara White shoving Luna that day and began pointing fingers.

Clara White’s face flushed, but she jutted out her chin defiantly. "I did it for her own good! Do you really think a high-ranking officer like Instructor Andrew would want her? Don’t be ridiculous!"

"Who says I don’t?"

A deep, steady voice cut through from the back of the crowd. Everyone turned to see Andrew Smith striding forward in his crisp military uniform, his insignia gleaming under the sun.

Luna’s breath hitched. She hadn’t expected Andrew to be here—let alone to...

"Instructor Andrew, this doesn’t concern you," she said quickly, stepping forward. "You saved me out of kindness. I won’t drag you into this."

Andrew’s gaze burned into hers before he smiled. "Luna White, I stand by my actions." Turning to the crowd, he declared firmly, "If my rescue has harmed Luna’s reputation, then I take responsibility."

The villagers gaped. Some young girls stomped their feet in envy, while Clara White’s face turned ashen.

"Mayor," Andrew saluted George Clark sharply, "I’ll submit a marriage report to my superiors. From today onward, anyone who dares speak ill of Luna—" His sharp glare landed on Clara White, "—answers to me."

Luna’s ears burned. Her heart pounded as she stared at Andrew’s resolute profile. This sudden turn of events left her both stunned and elated.

Clara White opened her mouth but ultimately slunk away, defeated. Andrew’s words, like a stone cast into still waters, sent ripples through the small mountain village.
###Chapter 39: Underhanded Tactics

Luna White was completely stunned.

Marriage?

Her and Instructor Andrew?

This was absurd.

Her thoughts were in chaos. Andrew was a good man—honest, upright, a military instructor. But they had only met three times!

Every encounter felt like something out of a movie.

And now they were talking about marriage?

She didn’t want this. Andrew probably felt obligated because he’d ruined her reputation. But that wasn’t fair. She’d jumped into the reservoir with her own motives.

If she ended up costing him his chance at true love, she’d never forgive herself.

As Luna spiraled into doubt, Andrew leaned in and whispered, "Don’t worry. I keep my word."

His tone was so firm she nearly rolled her eyes.

Clara White panicked. "Instructor Andrew, this isn’t right! You saved this girl—we should be thanking you, not burdening you with marriage!" She put on a show of concern.

Andrew chuckled. "By rights, I should call you Grandma. But now isn’t the time. I genuinely want to marry Luna. This isn’t a burden." He turned to the villagers. "Tell me, does a military instructor suit a university student like her?"

"Perfectly!" the crowd cheered.

The cadets egged them on. "A perfect match!"

Clara was yanked back by her daughter-in-law, Fiona, who realized pushing further would expose their scheme.

Once inside, Clara slammed the door.

Jack White took a drag from his cigarette. "What’s wrong?"

Fiona sneered. "Your precious niece just landed herself a golden ticket. Instructor Andrew wants to marry her. Frank Harris’s proposal is as good as dead."

Jack’s face darkened. If Luna married Andrew, they’d lose all control over her.

Clara gnashed her teeth. "Over my dead body! She’s not worthy!"

"Mom, what do we do now?"

Clara smirked. "When Frank gets here, we’ll take him straight to Luna. That pretty face of hers will do the rest." She lowered her voice. "I’ve got sleeping pills..."

Jack stiffened. "You think Frank will agree?"

"Him?" Clara scoffed. "A thug like that? He’ll jump at the chance."

Jack relaxed. After all, Luna wasn’t his blood. He felt no guilt.
###Chapter 40: Settled Dust

The courtyard finally quieted down.

George Clark and his wife left with worried expressions, even their farewell to Instructor Andrew seeming distracted. The students, however, were unusually eager—fetching water, sweeping the floor, their eyes darting toward Luna White every now and then. After all, she was their future instructor’s wife. They had to make a good impression.

Andrew leaned against the doorframe, his gaze lingering on Luna. The girl had been fidgeting since earlier, looking like she had something to say but couldn’t bring herself to speak. He touched his own face—was he really that intimidating?

"Instructor Andrew..." Luna finally blurted out, grabbing his wrist and pulling him inside. The coolness of her fingers sent a jolt through him, and instinctively, he tightened his grip.

"In a hurry?" he teased in a low voice once they were inside.

Luna suddenly realized how improper her actions were and quickly yanked her hand away. This wasn’t like the future she remembered—men and women couldn’t just casually touch like this in 1985!

"I need to talk to you," she said bluntly.

Andrew sighed. "Let me guess—you don’t want to burden me?" As a former scout, he could read her like an open book.

Luna’s head snapped up, her wide eyes full of surprise.

Unable to resist, he reached out and ruffled her hair, the dark strands slipping through his fingers. "Don’t touch me!" Luna recoiled like a startled cat, her face flushing red.

A few muffled chuckles came from outside the window.

"Ten push-ups!" Andrew barked, shoving the window open. Three eavesdropping students scrambled into the courtyard and dropped to the ground.

Luna burst out laughing. "Do all soldiers love listening in on private conversations?"

"I have plenty of other good qualities. You’ll find out soon enough," Andrew said with a smirk.

"Stop joking around!" Luna turned serious. "We’re not a good match. You’re a promising officer, and I’m just a village girl..."

"But you’re a college student," he interrupted. "The only one from this village. Doesn’t that make us a perfect pair?"

"I’ll be studying in the city for four years!" Luna argued. "What if I meet someone I like more there?"

Andrew’s expression darkened briefly before he smiled again. "Even better. Focus on your studies—I’ll send you living expenses every month. And if you do meet someone..." He paused. "I won’t stand in your way."

Luna was stunned. Was there really someone this foolish in the world?

"What do you get out of this?"

"A chance." He glanced at the students groaning through their push-ups in the courtyard. "Who knows? Maybe after spending time together, you’ll decide I’m not so bad. Besides..." He turned back to her. "Your grandmother won’t let this go easily, will she?"

That hit a nerve. Clara White would never give up so easily...

"Fine," Luna finally relented. "But if either of us finds someone better, we end this immediately."

"Deal." Andrew grinned like a fox.

Outside, the students exchanged knowing looks at the sound of their instructor’s laughter—looked like this was settled!

When it was time to leave, Andrew firmly declined Luna’s offer to stay for dinner. The students cast longing glances at the stove—they’d been dreaming about the braised pork Jack had raved about for ages...

"Next time," Andrew murmured to Luna, mischief glinting in his eyes.

Her face flushed as she nodded, watching them go. The moment the gate closed behind them, a thought struck her—this arrangement might not be as simple as she’d thought.
###Chapter 41: The Unwelcome Visit

Frank Harris jolted along the rugged mountain road behind Aunt Elizabeth Wright, his temper fraying with every step. Thirty miles of rough terrain was no place for the only son of the village mayor—a man who’d never so much as touched a hoe in his life.

"You’d better not be lying to me, Auntie," Frank snarled, wiping sweat from his brow. "If Luna White isn’t as pretty as you claim, you’ll regret it."

Elizabeth forced a smile. "Oh, my dear boy, would I dare? Luna’s the prettiest girl in ten villages! If her grandmother weren’t in such a hurry to marry her off, we’d never have this chance."

Frank scoffed. If his reputation in his own village weren’t so rotten—if girls didn’t scatter like mice at the sight of him—he wouldn’t be chasing some country girl in the middle of nowhere.

The moment they reached the White family’s doorstep, Frank curled his lip in disgust. The shack wasn’t fit for pigs, let alone people. If not for the promise of a pretty bride, he’d have turned right around.

Jack White stepped out to greet them, eyeing Frank’s neat attire with suspicion. Why is Clara so set on marrying Luna to this man?

"Uncle, where’s my bride?" Frank cut straight to the point, his gaze darting past Jack into the house.

Jack stiffened. No manners at all.

Elizabeth quickly intervened. "Come now, let’s have Luna come out. They ought to meet, don’t you think?"

Jack hesitated.

Frank’s patience snapped. "What? Think you’re too good for me?"

With no choice, Jack led him to find Luna. On their way, they crossed paths with Maya White. Frank’s eyes locked onto her retreating figure, his throat working.

"Uncle, was that your daughter? Is she spoken for?" Frank leered.

Jack’s blood boiled. This lecher has the nerve to eye Maya! Through gritted teeth, he said, "She’s already betrothed."

At the village entrance, they spotted Luna heading to the general store. Frank’s face lit up—she was skinny, but her delicate features were exquisite.

Luna froze as if struck by lightning. Frank Harris. The monster who’d made her previous life a living hell had arrived ahead of schedule.

"Luna, this is Frank Harris," Jack said stiffly. "He’s come to meet you."

Frank grinned, stepping too close. "What a pretty little thing!" His gaze raked over her like a predator sizing up prey.

Luna’s nails bit into her palms as she smiled coldly. Perfect. Since he’s delivered himself to her doorstep, she’d make sure he paid in blood this time.
###Chapter 42: The Plot

"Hey! It's Frank Harris!" The man slouched in front of Luna White with a cocky grin.

Luna wrinkled her nose in disgust, waving him away like a bothersome fly. "I don’t care who you are! This is a new era—I have a fiancé, so stop bothering me!" Just looking at this scoundrel made her sick.

Frank froze. Since when did this little brat talk so boldly?

"Luna, my family is one of the wealthiest in the village. You won’t find a better match!" He puffed out his chest, raising his voice.

Luna scoffed. "Oh, so you think you’re some prize? Don’t worry—I wouldn’t touch you with a ten-foot pole. Uncle, I’m leaving!" Without sparing him another glance, she turned on her heel and walked away.

Frank stomped his foot in frustration. He was known as the most charming bachelor in the village—what girl wouldn’t give him some respect? Yet today, this nobody had the nerve to humiliate him!

Jack White watched the scene unfold, secretly pleased but feigning disappointment. "Ah, that girl’s grown too proud to even listen to her own uncle. Frank, I’m sorry..."

"She just got into some college—what’s the big deal?" Frank spat through gritted teeth.

Jack lowered his voice. "Keep it down! That girl’s got a temper—she nearly beat her cousin to death yesterday. Honestly, it’s a blessing this didn’t work out..."

His words pretended to console but only fanned the flames of Frank’s anger.

Grumbling, Frank followed Jack back toward the house, ready to storm off—until he spotted Clara White sitting in the main hall.

"Oh dear, who upset our Frank?" the old woman asked, squinting.

Before Frank could answer, Maya White stepped out with a glass of sweetened water. The girl cast him a shy, fluttering glance, and instantly, his anger cooled.

Clara took Frank’s hand with a sigh. "It’s all Luna’s fault for being so ungrateful. Frank, I truly wanted you as my grandson-in-law..."

Frank’s eyes gleamed with calculation. "Grandma, I really wanted to marry Luna, but she—"

"If you truly want her, I have an idea." Clara leaned in, whispering conspiratorially.

Frank nearly jumped when he heard it. The old woman’s plan was downright vicious! Even he, as shameless as he was, had never considered something so low.

"But... if we get caught, I’ll end up in jail!" He shook his head frantically.

Clara grew impatient. "What’s there to fear? We’ll back you up!"

Just then, Maya lifted the curtain and stepped in, batting her lashes. "Frank, if you really like me... make this happen. Consider it... my dowry."

Staring at Maya’s coy expression, Frank found himself nodding. After all, Luna was beautiful—it wouldn’t be a loss. And once it was done, he could still marry Maya. A perfect deal.

"Fine! I’ll do it!" He grabbed Maya’s hand. "But remember—once it’s over, you’re marrying me!"

Maya blushed and nodded. "I promise." She couldn’t wait—Frank’s family was well-off, after all.

Both wore sweet smiles, though their minds teemed with deceit.

Unbeknownst to Luna, a venomous trap was closing in around her.
###Chapter 43: The Conspiracy

Clara White watched with cold disdain as Frank Harris clung to Maya White's hand, his lecherous gaze making her stomach churn. But now wasn’t the time to confront him—she needed to coax him into doing their bidding first. Once the deed was done, she’d see if he dared scheme further. The marriage between Luna White and Frank had been carefully orchestrated by the old woman herself.

Having lived most of her life, Clara had seen all kinds of men. Those who gambled always met ruin—selling their children, abandoning their wives. No matter how strict the rules, a dog would always return to its vomit. How could she let her own granddaughter leap into such a pit of fire?

Frank Harris marrying Luna? Over her dead body!

After a hushed discussion, they decided to act swiftly. Luna was set to leave for her sister’s house tomorrow, so they had to move before then. Clara had another motive: if Luna never made it to her sisters, Iris and the others would remain ignorant, and the family’s financial lifeline would stay intact.

As dusk settled, Luna packed her bags for her trip to Iris’s place. Iris lived nearby in town, just thirty miles away—a half-day’s walk. Her eldest sister lived farther, requiring a carriage ride and miles of mountain roads. She planned to visit Iris first, then her eldest sister.

Just as she started preparing dinner, a knock sounded at the gate.

"Who is it?"

"Luna, it’s your aunt. Your grandmother’s terribly ill. Your uncle’s gone to fetch the doctor, and Maya’s twisted her ankle. I can’t manage alone—your brothers are all thumbs. Come help, won’t you?" The urgency in Elizabeth Wright’s voice was palpable.

Luna’s heart clenched. Frank was still in the village, and this sudden summons reeked of trouble.

"Aunt, I’m not feeling well myself—dizzy and feverish. Maybe I’ll visit Grandma first thing tomorrow? If I pass my illness to her, it’ll only make things worse."

Elizabeth gritted her teeth in frustration. The girl had grown sharp as a tack, slippery as an eel.

"Luna, no matter how she’s treated you, she’s still your elder. She’s sick and wants to see you—is that too much to ask? What will the village think if they hear you’ve turned your back on family right after getting into university?" Elizabeth deliberately raised her voice, knowing her words held moral weight.

Luna knew she couldn’t refuse. Fine. If they wanted to play games, she’d meet them head-on.

"Alright, Aunt. I’ll come with you."

Elizabeth’s face lit up with exaggerated relief, her sudden warmth only heightening Luna’s suspicion—nothing good ever came from forced kindness.

They arrived at the White household in silence. The courtyard was eerily quiet, with no sign of Frank. Clara lay on the kang in the west room, a damp cloth on her forehead, moaning theatrically.

The moment Luna stepped inside, the old woman’s triumphant smirk betrayed her act.

"Grandma, what’s wrong?" Luna feigned concern, grabbing Clara’s wrist and subtly channeling her supernatural ability.

"Ow! Why’d you pinch me?" Clara yanked her hand back.

"I didn’t." Luna blinked innocently.

Clara inspected her wrist—not a single mark. Yet the pain had been sharp as a needle. What devilry was this?

She resumed her performance, groaning, "My head hurts, my chest hurts—everything hurts!"

No sooner had she spoken than a splitting headache seized her, her chest tightening as if crushed by a boulder. Cold sweat broke out across her brow.

Luna dutifully replaced the damp cloth. Soon, Dr. Steven Davis arrived, his expression grave after taking Clara’s pulse. "It looks like a stroke. She needs to get to the town hospital immediately—any delay could leave her paralyzed."

Jack White cursed inwardly. His mother had been faking—how could this quack take it seriously? She’d just devoured three bowls of rice!

"We’ll take her to the hospital first thing tomorrow. Luna, stay and tend to your grandmother tonight," Jack said smoothly, seizing the opportunity.

"Of course, I’ll stay." Luna agreed readily. So they wanted her to spend the night? Fine.

After the doctor left, Clara’s moans grew louder, grating on the nerves. Elizabeth marveled at her mother-in-law’s acting skills—truly masterful.

Maya was crushing pills into powder, mixing them with water and sugar. When her mother frowned at the wasted sugar, Maya laughed. "Mom, think of all the sugar we can buy once we get Luna’s dowry!"

Elizabeth’s anger melted into glee. Yes, once tonight’s plan succeeded, let’s see how this little wretch would squirm. A university student? Dream on. She’d be bearing Frank’s children soon enough.

To this family, Luna wasn’t human. They’d raised her—now she owed them her very life.
###Chapter 44: The Trap

Luna White watched coldly as Clara White groaned in pain, a smirk playing on her lips. The old hag deserved it. She hadn’t intended to go this far—Luna held grudges, but she wasn’t a monster who resorted to murder.

She preferred subtle revenge, the kind that left no trace. But Clara had insisted on provoking her. If the old woman wanted to play sick, Luna would make sure she suffered a real illness. Let’s see how much her precious son would "care" for her then.

A sudden chill ran down Luna’s spine—the backlash from using her supernatural ability. This time, it was mild. Reversing her power was different from healing, but compared to what she’d endured dealing with Paul Jackson, this was nothing.

"Luna, have some water." Fanny Hao pushed aside the curtain, carrying a bowl of sugar water, her face plastered with an unnatural smile. "You’ve been taking care of Grandma all night. Drink up and rest."

Luna accepted the bowl, instantly noticing Fanny’s nervous gaze. The woman pretended to look away, but her eyes kept darting back, watching Luna’s every move.

A faint sniff nearly made Luna laugh. Cheap sleeping pills—how amateurish. This had Clara’s fingerprints all over it.

"Why aren’t you drinking?" Fanny fidgeted, wringing her hands. "Not sweet enough? I can add more sugar—"

Luna took a small sip and nearly gagged. The water was sickeningly sweet—did they want to drown her in sugar?

Fanny visibly relaxed once she saw Luna drink.

Luna set the bowl down after two sips. She wasn’t about to force herself to finish that syrup, but Fanny only needed to believe she’d taken the drug.

With a quiet pulse of her supernatural ability, she neutralized the sleeping pills effortlessly.

"Luna? You okay?" Fanny asked cautiously when Luna’s gaze grew unfocused.

Luna feigned drowsiness, her eyelids fluttering. "Auntie… I’m… so tired…" Before she could finish, she slumped against the edge of the bed.

Fanny’s face lit up with triumph. She gave Luna a theatrical shake. "Luna? Luna!" When there was no response, she called out, "Come in! Get her out of here!"

Maya White and Frank Harris burst in. Frank had been lurking next door, peeking through the window crack the whole time.

They hauled the "unconscious" Luna up. Maya gritted her teeth under the weight—How is this starving brat so heavy?!

They dumped Luna in Maya’s room. Maya smirked at Frank. "Lucky you. My little sister’s one of the prettiest girls in the village. Enjoy." She turned to leave.

Frank grabbed her wrist. "Maya, I’m doing this for you. Don’t forget what you promised."

Maya forced a smile, hiding her disgust. "Don’t worry. I’ll keep my word." She yanked her arm free and hurried out.

She wasn’t stupid. Clara had warned her about Frank—a gambling, womanizing beast in human skin. All she cared about was getting rid of Luna.

Frank rubbed his hands together, humming a vulgar tune as he approached the bed. His fingers had barely brushed the covers when an ice-cold hand clamped around his wrist.

His blood turned to ice. He tried to muffle Luna’s mouth, but his limbs went weak—he couldn’t even scream. His eyes darted in terror as the "unconscious" girl slowly sat up.

Luna held a silver needle, her smile chilling. Frank had done plenty of vile things in his life, but he’d never been this afraid.

Now he understood why he couldn’t move.

This delicate-looking girl wasn’t prey—she was the predator.
###Chapter 45: I Have a Short Temper

"Wondering why you can't move?" Luna White's smile sent chills down Frank Harris's spine. What was this woman planning?

"Mmph... mmph..." Frank strained to speak, but only managed muffled groans.

Outside, Maya White smirked at the commotion. Go ahead, Luna. See how you'll make it to university now.

University? She scoffed. More like ruined goods.

Maya lounged under the tree, waiting for Frank's signal. She and Fiona had plotted this perfectly—once Frank succeeded, Fiona would fake an emergency, calling for help. One loud accusation, and Luna's reputation would be shredded.

Let’s see her rise above me then.

Jack White had taken Ethan and the others next door, keeping his hands clean. When the time came, they'd claim Luna seduced Frank. Who would doubt it?

Frank wasn’t stupid enough to admit assault. Luna would be his wife, whether she liked it or not.

Maya giggled, shaking with glee. Luna would never outshine her again.

——————

Frank trembled—or at least, he thought he did. In reality, he was frozen like a statue, one knee braced against the bedframe, his hand suspended midair.

Luna twirled a silver needle before his eyes.

A soft, mocking laugh made his pulse thunder. He wanted to scream, to strike her—but not a single finger obeyed.

"Frank Harris," Luna murmured, pressing the needle to his temple, "if I wanted you dead... the police would only find a brain hemorrhage. Quick. Painless."

Frank's eyes bulged. I don’t want to die! He blinked desperately, all lust replaced by raw terror.

"A worthless gambler and womanizer like you?" Her voice was silk. "Who’d question it? So... should I kill you? Or kill you?"

For a moment, she meant it. In her past life, this brute had beaten her bloody, caused three miscarriages. His parents had branded her a barren failure.

But death was too kind.

"Oh? Did you wet yourself?" Luna wrinkled her nose. "Pathetic."

A dark stain spread across Frank’s pants.

"Changed my mind. I won’t kill you—yet." She withdrew the needle. "I’ll free you, but if you scream or run..." The metal glinted. "Blink twice if you understand."

Frank’s eyelids fluttered like frantic butterflies.

The needle lifted. Frank collapsed onto the bed, muscles screaming from prolonged rigidity.

"Hel—" His cry died as the needle flickered.

"Memory problems?" Luna whispered in his ear. "Let me help you remember."

Agony exploded from his bones. Frank felt himself writhing, howling—but his body stayed rigid. Every fiber convulsed in torment, worse than death.

Outside, Maya tapped her foot. What’s taking so long?

Luna’s finished.

"Ready to behave?" Luna pulled the needle free. "Scream again, and this pain returns every two hours—until it kills you."

Frank blinked wildly. That death was unthinkable!

"Call Maya in. I’ll knock her out. The rest..." Luna smirked. "You’ll figure it out."

Frank nodded like a desperate dog.

"Try anything funny..." Luna chuckled. "After we marry, I’ll play with needles daily. Like I said—I have a short temper."

Frank shuddered. The thought of sharing a bed with this viper... Death would be kinder.

He nodded again, obedient as a whipped cur.
###Chapter 46: A Failed Scheme Backfires

Luna White leaned against the doorframe, a silver needle glinting between her fingers.

"Maya! Get in here!" Frank Harris's hoarse voice was barely audible, drained of strength by the excruciating pain he had just endured.

Maya's eyes lit up, her lips curling into a smug smile. Success! She called out to her mother, "Mom! Go get help!" She was about to rush inside, eager to witness Luna's downfall.

"Stop!" Her mother yanked her back. "What are you doing, barging in like that?"

Maya stamped her foot impatiently. "Just go! Tell everyone Grandma's sick!" She shook off her mother's grip. "Hurry, before they catch on!"

Her mother gritted her teeth. "Fine. But finish this quickly and get out!" Then she sprinted outside, shrieking, "Help! The old lady's dying!"

Maya smoothed her clothes and pushed through the curtain—only to find Frank sitting pale-faced on the bed, with no sign of Luna.

"Where's Luna?" she demanded. Then a sudden numbness spread through her back, and her legs gave way.

Frank fumbled to catch her as she collapsed, lifting his gaze to meet Luna's icy stare.

"Forgot to mention," Luna twirled the needle between her fingers, "this thing hurts twice a day—noon and midnight, two hours each time." She headed toward Clara White's room. "Think carefully about what you’re going to say."

Frank shuddered, his arms trembling around Maya. The memory of that bone-deep agony extinguished any rebellious thoughts.

A rustling sound came from the bed. Frank swallowed hard, staring at Maya’s half-undone clothes. Well, I was going to marry her anyway...

Luna sat beside Clara, gently wiping the old woman’s drool.

"Grandma, you've had a stroke," she murmured. "See? Dr. Davis was right." She pressed a finger to Clara’s trembling lips. "Don’t worry. The show’s about to start."

Clara’s eyes bulged with fury, but she couldn’t move a muscle.

Outside, chaos erupted as Maya’s mother returned with Mayor George Clark, Security Chief Paul Jackson, and a crowd of villagers.

A piercing scream tore through the night.

Paul and a few young men rushed into the room—only to retreat, red-faced.

Maya’s mother feigned panic, charging in. "What happened? Is everything—"

Her words died in her throat.

Maya huddled under a blanket, trembling, while Frank fastened his pants. The glaring red stain on the sheets left no doubt about what had transpired.

"Frank!" she shrieked. "You promised me!"

Village women crowded in, eyes darting. "Oh my, is this the new son-in-law?"

Maya buried her face in the blanket, wishing she could vanish.

"Don’t worry, Mom," Frank grinned. "I’ll come propose tomorrow."

Paul shook his head in the courtyard. "The White girl... such a disgrace!"

Luna stood by the window, watching the uproar outside. The silver needle spun gracefully between her fingers, catching the light.
###Chapter 47: The Son-in-Law

"Who said I'd marry you? You're Luna's fiancé! I'd rather die than marry scum like you!" Maya White shrieked hysterically, her voice cracking. She remembered Grandma's warnings—Frank Harris was a gambling, womanizing drunk, the worst kind of trash. Marrying him would ruin her life.

Several nosy aunties stopped in their tracks.

"My, my, Maya, that's quite the accusation," Aunt Elizabeth Wright said with a sly smile, eyes darting between them. "If Frank really is Luna's fiancé, what were you doing rolling around with your sister's man? That's downright shameless!"

"Absolutely disgraceful!"

"Maya, have you lost your mind? Spouting such nonsense—you're bringing shame to the family!"

Clara White frantically intervened, stomping her foot. "The girl's just embarrassed you all saw her quarreling with her fiancé. As married women, surely you understand young lovers' tiffs?" She swallowed her anger—with so many witnesses, denying Frank as their son-in-law would destroy Maya's reputation.

Frank's eyes gleamed as he plastered on a grin. "Ladies, I was originally engaged to Luna, but she's a college girl—too good for a rough fellow like me. Maya's been kind, and I've grown fond of her. Young passion, you know..." He lowered his voice conspiratorially, "Blame the drink—got my blood running hot..."

The aunties tittered, the scandal smoothed over by his silver tongue.

When Maya opened her mouth to protest, Frank wheeled around with a glare so vicious it silenced her instantly.

"Mom, why don't you see the ladies out while Maya and I... tidy up," Frank said sweetly, addressing Clara as "Mom" with nauseating familiarity.

The endearment made Clara's stomach churn. Who wanted a degenerate like him for a son-in-law?

Forcing a smile, she ushered the women out, dragging Luna's name into it: "If only Luna had stayed to watch Maya properly, this wouldn't have happened..."

"Luna was here?" someone perked up.

"Where is she?" The crowd buzzed with gossipy excitement.

Clara sighed dramatically. "When I left earlier, Luna and Frank were talking inside. Next thing I know..." She was determined to implicate Luna.

"Auntie, I've been tending to Grandma in her room this whole time," Luna said suddenly from the doorway, holding a damp towel. "Don't smear my name to cover up Maya's disgrace."

Clara jumped. "Goodness, child, you scared me—"

"Today of all days," Luna said tearfully, "when I just got engaged to Lieutenant Andrew Smith. Are you trying to drive me to my grave with these lies?" She turned to the crowd. "Judge for yourselves—I'm innocent! I won't bear false accusations!"

Mayor George Clark stepped forward. "Clara, think before you speak. Everyone knows Luna's character."

Security Chief Paul Jackson added pointedly, "Exactly. Luna's a decent girl—unlike some." His gaze flicked toward Maya's room.

Clara trembled with rage. "Mayor, Chief, just because Luna helped you once doesn't mean you can favor her! Earlier, she clearly—"

"Then let Frank come out and confront me!" Luna said firmly. "I won't admit to what I didn't do!"

Mayor Clark nodded grimly. "Good idea. Luna's right—no innocent person should be slandered."

Luna wiped her tears. "Auntie, I know you and Uncle Jack resent me moving out because there's fewer hands to work. But ruining my reputation? Tonight, you insisted I come care for Grandma—I haven't left her side."

"Enough!" Clara shook with fury. "Luna, your silver tongue wins. Frank! Get out here and explain!"

"Frank Harris!"
###Chapter 48: The Truth Revealed

The moment Frank Harris heard the footsteps of Clara White and the others leaving, a sinister grin spread across his face. He strode to the bed and roughly pressed his coarse palm against Maya White’s bare shoulder.

"Ah! What are you doing?" Maya shrank back in terror, the blanket slipping to reveal her pale skin.

"Stop pretending," Frank sneered, his eyes roaming shamelessly over her. "The whole village saw you lying naked with me."

Maya trembled with fury. "Frank Harris! You promised it would be Luna! You set me up!"

Frank leisurely buttoned his shirt. "You wanted to trap Luna, but you ended up trapping yourself. Whose fault is that?" He suddenly grabbed her chin. "If you hadn’t tried to scheme against her, I wouldn’t have suffered like this!"

Tears welled in Maya’s eyes as his grip tightened painfully.

"Now the whole village knows you’re mine," Frank hissed, leaning closer. "Either marry me quietly, or—" His fingers dug in harder. "—die."

Maya gasped for air, frantically slapping at his arm. Frank finally released her with a cruel smirk. "Think carefully. Who else would want a used woman like you?"

Outside, Clara’s voice called for him. Frank straightened his collar and stepped out.

The yard was crowded with villagers. Clara immediately rushed to him. "Frank, was Luna in that room just now?"

Mayor George Clark frowned. "Clara, what are you implying?"

"I—I was just asking..." Clara forced a nervous laugh, shooting Frank desperate looks.

Frank lowered his head but spoke clearly. "Mom, don’t make me lie. Luna was never in that room. It was always Maya..."

"You’re lying!" Clara stamped her foot in frustration.

Just then, Jack White arrived with his sons, taking in the scene with feigned surprise. "What’s going on here?"

Mayor Clark snorted. "Jack, your family’s schemes grow bolder by the day! Plotting against your own niece!"

Suddenly, Frank dropped to his knees. "Mayor, it’s my fault! Uncle Jack and Aunt Clara never told me to lie. I was just... tempted by greed."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Clara turned deathly pale, swaying on her feet.

At the back of the crowd, Luna White watched with a cold smile.

The show was finally over.
###Chapter 49: Paralysis

Luna White hurriedly led the crowd inside. "Mayor, Security Chief, uncles and aunts—come quick! It's Grandma!" Her voice trembled with tears.

The moment the group entered, Jack White shot his wife, Amy, a venomous glare. Useless woman! He quickly pushed his way into the room.

His own mother was sick—how could the "filial son" not be present?

Mayor George Clark took one look at Clara White’s twisted mouth and drooping eye, and his brow furrowed. Strokes were rare in the village, but he’d seen enough bedridden elders to recognize the signs. The old woman was most likely paralyzed.

"Jack, get her to the hospital! Any delay could be fatal!" George set aside their past grudges—saving a life came first.

Jack shoved his way to the bed, only to recoil at the sight of his mother. He shook her roughly. "Mom? Mom, wake up!" Wasn’t this supposed to be an act?

Clara rolled limply to the side, her fingers curled like claws. The blanket shifted, releasing a pungent stench of urine. The crowd gagged and backed away.

George clenched his jaw. "I’ll fetch the tractor. Get her ready." He strode out without another word.

The others scrambled after him, eager to escape the foul air.

Panicked, Jack barked at Luna, "Change your grandmother’s clothes!"—then tried to slip out himself.

Luna yanked him back. "Uncle, maybe Aunt Amy should do it. Grandma’s things are locked up—I wouldn’t dare touch them." Oh no, you don’t.

Jack’s eyes gleamed. Right—the old woman’s savings are still in that chest! He forced a greasy smile. "Then go call your aunt."

The fakeness of it made Luna’s stomach turn.

Amy was still fuming in the yard, baffled by Frank Harris’s sudden support for Luna over her own family.

"Aunt, Uncle wants you to change Grandma’s clothes," Luna said flatly before walking off.

Amy cursed under her breath as she entered—then let out a shrill wail. "Mama! What’s happened to you?!"

Luna ignored her and turned to leave.

"L-Luna..." Frank stammered, his legs shaking.

She glanced back coldly. "What?"

He flinched. "I—I—"

"Luna! Help me!" Amy shrieked from inside.

Luna narrowed her eyes. Already disgusted by her? She’d love to see how this family planned to "care" for the old woman.

Seizing the chance, Frank shouted toward the house, "Maya! Come tend to Grandma!" then grinned obsequiously at Luna.

George returned with the tractor. "Jack, hurry!" Spotting Luna, he frowned. "Maya and Luna stay here. Ethan and David can help carry her."

The crowd murmured agreement.

Ethan and David pinched their noses as they entered, nearly retching at the stench.

Amy muttered while changing Clara’s soiled clothes, "How did she just collapse? What do we do now?"

Jack seized the moment to pocket his mother’s hidden savings, hissing, "Shut up! The whole village is watching!"

Perfect chance to salvage my reputation, he thought.
###Chapter 50: Karma Strikes

The rumbling sound of the tractor faded into the distance, carrying the unconscious Clara White and the wailing family of Jack White into the night.

The yard finally fell silent.

The villagers who had gathered to watch yawned and dispersed, but everyone knew this wasn’t over. By tomorrow, the scandal of Maya White and Frank Harris rolling in the sheets would spread through every village for miles.

"Tsk, tsk. The Whites have really outdone themselves this time," Aunt Amy muttered to her husband as they walked away. "I heard Maya’s been cozying up to Frank for a while, just waiting to push Luna out and take her place."

"Exactly!" her husband whispered. "And I heard old Mrs. White was so desperate to scrape together a dowry for her youngest son, she even tried to drown her own granddaughter in the reservoir..."

Rumors took flight, spreading like wildfire through the darkness. By the time the White family returned from the county hospital, the village had already spun seven or eight versions of the story—each more outrageous than the last.

Frank stood in the yard, sweat beading on his forehead. He wanted to run, but the memory of that excruciating pain from earlier made his legs feel like jelly.

"L-Luna..." He dropped to his knees with a thud. "I was wrong! I swear I’ll never come near you again! Just spare me!"

Luna watched his pathetic display with cold amusement. That acupuncture needle had been nothing special—no poison, no curse. But this idiot had swallowed the lie whole.

"Want the antidote?" She deliberately drew out her words. "Find rainwater, a child’s urine, century-old pinecones, and a pair of male crickets. Boil them down to one bowl of liquid. Drink it for ten days straight."

Frank clutched at the instructions like a lifeline, kowtowing frantically before scrambling away into the night.

Just as Luna turned to go inside, a shrill scream pierced the air.

"It’s all your fault!"

Maya burst out, hair disheveled and eyes bloodshot. "You were supposed to marry Frank! You ruined everything!"

"I ruined it?" Luna turned, her smile chilling under the moonlight. "Frank was your doing. Regretting it now?"

Maya lunged at her like a madwoman, but Luna shoved her away effortlessly.

"Save your energy." Luna brushed off her sleeves. "You’ve lived like a pampered princess all these years. You can’t even lift a bucket of water—what makes you think you can fight me?"

She leaned in, whispering into Maya’s ear, "Congratulations, dear cousin. May you and Frank... live happily ever after."

As Luna walked away, Maya trembled violently. Since when had her meek little cousin become so terrifying?

No. She wouldn’t just sit here and take this!

Maya stormed into her parents’ room, smashed the lock off their savings box, and stuffed every last bill into her bag. She threw together a few clothes and slipped out of the yard before dawn.

The south! That’s where she’d go. They said the cities there were paved with gold—anyone willing to work could strike it rich. She refused to stay in this hellhole and marry that bastard Frank!

As the sky lightened, Maya clutched her bundle and ran toward the village entrance without a backward glance. She didn’t see Luna standing in the shadows of a nearby tree, a knowing smile playing on her lips.

"Run. The farther, the better." Luna murmured to herself. "Wait until you learn the truth... That’s when the real fun begins."

In the morning light, she turned and headed back inside to pack. Today, she was leaving for the provincial capital to find her sister.
###Chapter 51: The Journey Begins

Dawn had barely broken when the village bus stop was already crowded. The early bus was the only transportation to town—missing it meant a sixty-mile trek on foot through mountainous terrain.

Luna White adjusted her small bundle when she heard someone call her name.

"Luna, where are you off to so early?" Clara Clark approached, pulling her daughter Lily along, her face warm with a friendly smile.

"Auntie, I'm visiting my sister Iris in town," Luna said, lifting her bundle slightly. "And I need to send my brother Ethan a telegram about my university acceptance letter."

Clara's eyes lit up. "Oh, what wonderful news! Iris will be thrilled to see you. Tomorrow, I'll have George put up the honor roll so the whole village knows we've got a university student among us!"

Just then, Mayor George Clark lowered his voice. "Isn’t that Maya? Wrapped in a scarf in this heat, sneaking around like a thief."

Luna followed his gaze and spotted a figure in a floral scarf pushing onto the bus—Maya, unmistakable in her furtive movements.

"Maya!" Clara clapped a hand on her shoulder. "Where are you off to?"

Maya jumped, her face pale beneath the scarf. "I—I'm visiting Grandma..."

"If you're visiting family, why skulk around?" Clara teased.

Maya stammered, her eyes darting toward Luna. Then, as if struck by inspiration, she brightened.

"Luna, I heard you're visiting Iris?" Maya sidled closer, her smile artificial. "I haven’t seen her in ages. Why don’t we go together?"

Luna suppressed a cold laugh. After yesterday’s disgrace, Maya suddenly wanted to visit family? Clearly, she was plotting something.

"Sure," Luna agreed cheerfully. "Company on the road would be nice."

Clara nodded approvingly. "That’s more like family."

As the bus rumbled to life, Luna glimpsed Maya through the window, gripping her clothes with white-knuckled intensity, her gaze dark. Luna allowed herself a small smirk—if Maya wanted to play games, she’d play along.

Maya’s mind churned with venomous schemes. Once they reached Iris’s home, she’d expose Luna’s true origins in front of everyone. Let’s see if Iris would still dote on this bastard then!

Dust swirled behind the wheels as the two girls—each harboring their own secrets—set off on the same journey.
###Chapter 52: The Crowd

Maya White couldn't help but smirk when Luna White agreed. She discreetly touched the money pouch hidden in her clothes, its weight bringing her comfort. With this sum, her future was finally secure.

The thought of Jack White and Clara White's reactions when they discovered the missing money made Maya uneasy. But she quickly straightened her back—after all, her brothers were the favorites in the family. As a daughter, she had always been dispensable. If not for Luna, an outsider, standing in the way, she might not even have had this much presence.

"When trouble comes, Father and Mother will always protect their sons first," Maya thought, biting her lip. "I won't just sit around and wait for disaster."

She refused to marry that gambler, Frank Harris, and spend her life trapped in a backwater village. This time, she would fight for herself.

As for Luna... A shadow of malice flickered in Maya's eyes.

After the bus arrived at its stop, Luna politely bid farewell to Mayor George Clark and his wife. Maya followed closely behind, carrying a bulky bundle on her back.

Luna held only an old cloth bag. In this era, plastic bags were still a rarity, and villagers mostly used handwoven bamboo baskets.

Standing by the roadside, Luna felt lost. She hadn’t been to town since Iris White's wedding. She only vaguely remembered that Iris's husband, Henry Cooper, was a carpenter who lived near the market.

"What are you spacing out for?" Maya snapped impatiently, eyeing Luna with suspicion.

"Do you know the way?" Luna shot back.

"N-No!"

"Then why the rush?" Luna scoffed. It was laughable how Maya still acted so superior.

"Can’t you ask for directions? What’s the point of having a mouth?" Maya retorted out of habit.

Luna ignored her and walked away. If not for the need to extract information, she wouldn’t have traveled with Maya in the first place.

"Wait for me!" Maya hurried after her.

After confirming the market’s location, Luna spotted a row of neat single-story houses. In this era, most town residences were cave-style dwellings like these—only government offices had multi-story buildings.

"Excuse me, ma'am, could you tell me where Iris White lives?" Luna stopped a woman pouring water outside.

"Third row, middle—sixth or seventh house, I think," the woman kindly pointed out.

Luna’s heart tightened with nervousness. It had been two lifetimes since she’d last seen her second sister. The only memory left was Iris smiling at her with a thick braid swaying.

"Quit dawdling!" Maya shoved her abruptly.

"Touch me again and see what happens!" Luna snapped. If not for her drained supernatural ability, Maya would’ve regretted it.

Only then did Maya remember Luna wasn’t the same pushover anymore. She withdrew her hand resentfully.

As they approached the row of houses, loud commotion reached them. A crowd had gathered, and from within came a child’s cries and a woman’s furious shouting.

"That Mrs. Laura Taylor is too much!"
"Iris is just too soft-hearted..."
"Without a man at home, she’s at a disadvantage."

The murmurs rose and fell. Luna’s chest clenched. She pushed through the crowd to see what was happening.
###Chapter 53: Twisting the Truth

Luna White pushed through the crowd and immediately spotted her older sister, Iris, flushed with embarrassment as a woman with hands on her hips berated her, forcing her to retreat step by step. The woman held a chubby five-year-old boy by the arm while pointing aggressively at the tearful little girl behind Iris, spittle flying as she ranted.

"You raised a fine daughter! How dare she lay hands on my boy at such a young age? My little Tiger is the only heir in three generations! If anything happens to him, can you even afford to compensate us?" The woman’s shrill voice cut through the air like a blade. "If you don’t give me an answer today, I’m moving into your house!"

Though the onlookers wore sympathetic expressions, none dared to speak up. Luna recognized her instantly—Laura Taylor, the notoriously sharp-tongued wife of Factory Team Leader Wang.

"Fine. What kind of answer do you want?"

Luna stepped forward, shielding Iris. Her sister tugged at her sleeve anxiously. "Luna, don’t—"

Laura looked Luna up and down with disdain. "Who do you think you are? This isn’t your place to talk!"

"I’m the child’s aunt." Luna smirked, gesturing to the red-eyed little girl. "Look at your son—he’s half a head taller than our Daisy and built like a little bull. And you’re claiming she beat him up?" She turned to the crowd. "Does anyone here actually believe that?"

The murmurs erupted into loud protests.

"Exactly! Tiger’s always picking on others!"
"Last time, he pushed Daisy until her head was bleeding!"
"We all saw him snatch candy from her!"

Laura’s face twisted between pale and red before she suddenly shrieked, "Iris! If you don’t pay for my son’s medical bills today, I’ll report you to the factory! See if they’ll keep a temporary worker like you!"

Iris flinched and hurried forward. "Sister-in-law, the kids were just playing—"

"Playing?!" Laura shoved her back. "Pay up or get lost!"

Luna steadied her stumbling sister, her gaze sharp as steel. "Iris, we’re not backing down this time." She turned to Laura. "Let’s go to the factory right now. I’d love to ask the management if being a permanent employee’s family means you can act like a tyrant!"

She seized Laura’s wrist with an iron grip. "And while we’re at it, we can discuss how an adult like you hit a child! Let’s see who really owes whom compensation!"

Laura staggered from the force, her face finally paling.
###Chapter 54: Tit for Tat

Iris White's heart pounded. The factory manager wasn’t her relative, and she knew she was in the wrong. She had only bullied Iris because she thought she was weak. If this went to the higher-ups, she’d be in serious trouble.

"Let me go!" Laura Taylor yanked her arm, trying to break free from Luna White’s grip. "Who do you think you are? Why should I listen to you?" She resorted to shameless defiance.

Luna tightened her hold on Laura’s wrist. "Apologize to my niece! Pay for her medical bills and emotional damages, or you’re not leaving today!" Her gaze was sharp as a blade.

Laura panicked. She was used to playing the victim, not being cornered like this. "Dream on! Why should I pay a dime?" She wasn’t one to back down easily.

"Fine! Then we’ll take this to the factory manager!" Luna dragged her forward.

"No!" Laura clawed at the wall, her nails nearly breaking.

Her son, Tiger, burst into tears, clinging to her leg. "Mom, I’m sorry! I hit Daisy! I shouldn’t have taken her things!"

Luna abruptly released her, and Laura collapsed to the ground, clutching her son and trembling.

"Luna, just let it go..." Iris couldn’t bear the scene.

Luna shook her head. No wonder Laura was so brazen—she acted just like Luna in her past life.

"We can’t let it go! If we back down today, they’ll walk all over us tomorrow!" Luna snapped. "Let’s see if the factory really belongs to her family!"

Laura immediately switched tactics, sobbing to Iris. "My husband is our only breadwinner! Are you trying to ruin us? If he loses his job, we’ll have to beg at your doorstep!"

Iris quickly tried to calm her. "My sister didn’t mean it—"

"Don’t speak for me, Iris!" Luna smirked and motioned for Daisy to come closer. "Remember, we don’t start fights, but we don’t run from them either. If someone hits you, hit them back!"

Daisy hesitated. "But Mom says fighting is bad..."

Maya White suddenly jumped in. "Luna! How can you teach a child to fight? You should lead by example!"

Laura seized the opportunity. "Exactly! What kind of upbringing is this?"

"Alright," Luna crooked a finger. "Come here."

Maya took a step back. "What are you doing?"

"You said we shouldn’t fight back, right?" Luna slapped her twice across the face. "Show me your so-called virtue!"

"You’re insane!" Maya lunged at her.

Luna twisted her arm behind her back. "I thought you believed in turning the other cheek? Why are you fighting back now?" She scoffed. "Easy to preach when it’s not your face getting slapped!"

The crowd erupted in laughter.

"Well said!"
"That’s the way!"
"Serves her right!"

Humiliated and furious, Maya was no match for Luna.

Luna scanned the onlookers. "Two choices: One, apologize and pay up. Two, we take this to the factory manager!"

She was determined to make sure Iris wouldn’t be pushed around anymore.

Laura’s chest heaved with rage. She smacked her son hard. "This is all your fault! Go apologize now!"
###Chapter 55: No More Bullying

Little Bao clutched his stinging bottom as he shuffled toward Daisy, sniffling pitifully, his face streaked with tears and snot. "D-Daisy... I'm sorry... I won't snatch your things again..."

Daisy's heart softened at his miserable state. She wiped his tears with her sleeve. "Alright, as long as you know you were wrong." Kids never held grudges for long.

Little Bao nodded vigorously, fresh tears rolling down his cheeks. "I swear! If anyone bullies you, I'll beat them up!"

Laura Taylor stormed over, her face dark with fury. She yanked Little Bao's ear, dragging him back. "Standing here making a fool of yourself!" Humiliation burned in her chest—today had been a complete disgrace.

Luna White stepped forward, blocking their path with a cold smirk. "Leaving so soon?" Her voice was sharp. "An apology is expected, but what about compensation?"

She wasn’t being petty. Bullies only learned their lesson when it hurt. A simple "sorry" wasn’t enough—they had to feel the sting.

Laura’s eyes darted, then she suddenly dropped to the ground, slapping her thigh as if ready to wail. Luna cut her off with an icy tone. "Go ahead. Scream. I’ll take Daisy straight to the factory gates and see who cries louder."

Laura’s fake sob choked in her throat, her face flushing crimson. The factory? That was her husband’s livelihood! This girl was ruthless.

"W-what do you want?" Laura’s voice shrank to a whisper.

The watching neighbors instinctively took a step back. The White girl was fierce—no one wanted to get scorched by her fire.

"Simple." Luna arched a brow. "Have your husband make five hundred coal briquettes, and we’ll call it even."

Laura brightened instantly. "Deal!" No money lost—just some labor? She almost thought the Whites were being generous.

The crowd dispersed, murmuring as they left:

"Iris’ sister is something else!"
"Who’d dare mess with her family now?"
"Wish I had a sister like that..."

Iris pulled Luna toward home, her heart aching yet warm. Her little sister used to be so timid—this sharpness must have come from hardship at their uncle’s place.

Daisy clung to Luna’s sleeve, her small face glowing with excitement. "Mom, is this Auntie Luna? She’s amazing!"

Maya trailed behind, stomping in frustration. No one paid her any attention, and her grip on her bag nearly tore the fabric.


###Chapter 56: Housework

Luna White stepped over the threshold holding little Daisy's hand, and the pungent scent of mildew mixed with sweat immediately assaulted her nose.

So this was Iris's home.

The exterior looked decent enough, but inside, the furniture was old and peeling, clearly used for over a decade. Her brother-in-law was a carpenter, yet his own home lacked even a single decent piece of furniture.

Not to mention the stifling air—damp laundry piled on the floor, a basin of soaking clothes indicating Iris had been washing just moments before.

"Oh! You're here!" Iris hastily kicked some clutter aside and ushered Luna inside. "Come in, sit down! This is my brother-in-law, William, and my sisters, Luna and Maya."

In the dim inner room, a gaunt young man lay curled on the bed. His face was unnaturally pale, his fingers nervously twisting the frayed edges of the blanket. He couldn’t even muster a proper greeting.

"Hello," Luna said softly before pulling Iris further inside.

Maya rolled her eyes and turned on her heel, ready to leave.

The inner room was slightly brighter. A large bed sat by the window, flanked by two smaller ones. A battered wardrobe stood in the corner, its paint long chipped away. The once-white walls were now yellowed and blackened by years of cooking fumes.

"Sit, sit! I’ll make food!" Iris rubbed her hands together. "You don’t visit often—I’ll buy some meat, and we’ll make dumplings!"

Maya flopped onto the bed with a dramatic sigh. The place was shabby, but at least it was clean—finally, she could breathe.

"Sis, I’m starving!" Maya whined.

Iris dug out a small cloth bundle from the bottom of the wardrobe—a few crumpled bills and loose coins inside. Just as she was about to tuck it into her pocket, Luna stopped her.

"Don’t waste money, Sis. Whatever you have at home is fine. We’re family—no need for formalities." Luna could tell those few dollars had taken Iris ages to save.

"Silly girl, you hardly ever visit..." Iris gently pushed her hand away. "Let’s treat it like a holiday!" She untied her apron and headed out.

Daisy’s eyes lit up. She tugged Luna’s sleeve and whispered, "Auntie, can you visit more often?"

"Why’s that?" Luna stroked the girl’s dull, yellowish hair.

"Because then we get to eat meat!" The little girl grinned ear to ear.

Luna’s heart ached and warmed at the same time.

Meanwhile, Maya had sprawled on the bed like a corpse. Luna promptly kicked her.

"What?!" Maya nearly jumped up, but seeing it was Luna, she only dared to glare.

"Go fetch water."

"Why me?!"

"Either work or get out. No freeloaders here." Luna rolled up her sleeves, tied on an apron, and strode outside. Sunlight flooded in as she pushed aside the door curtain.

"I’m a guest!" Maya protested, refusing to move.

"Got any shame?" Luna scoffed. "Keep dawdling, and you won’t get a single bite."

"Then what are you doing?" Maya grumbled as she finally got up.

Luna was already scrubbing clothes in a basin. "Want to switch?"

Maya eyed the mountain of sheets and quilts, then sulkily picked up the bucket.

"Daisy, show our esteemed guest where to get water." Luna winked at the little girl.

"I know the way!" Daisy skipped ahead cheerfully.

Maya stomped her foot in frustration but had no choice but to follow.

Luna worked swiftly, finishing the laundry in no time. Maya glared—the water she’d just fetched was already gone.

While hanging the clothes, Iris returned with meat and leeks. The moment she saw the laundry on the line, she panicked. "You silly girl! Coming to my house just to work? Didn’t you do enough at Grandma’s?"

She grabbed Luna’s hands, distressed. "At my place, you rest!"
###Chapter 57: Misunderstandings and Hidden Feelings

Luna White accepted the basket of chives from Iris, her fingertips brushing against morning dew. "Second Sister, since when do we stand on ceremony?" She rolled up her sleeves with practiced ease. "Now that I've moved out, life feels lighter."

The cleaver in Iris's hand clattered onto the cutting board. "What? Grandma kicked you out?" She stamped her foot. "I'll go give her a piece of my mind!"

"Easy now." Luna chuckled, settling onto a stool beneath the grapevine. Sunlight dappled her face through the leaves. "I left on my own. Eating scraps and doing all the chores while you all sent money every month—what's the point?"

The rhythmic thud of chopping resumed from the kitchen. Iris peeked out, brows knitted. "You silly girl... Things will get better once you're in college." She hesitated. "Wait—your entrance exam..."

"I passed!" Luna sprang to the doorway, waving the chives. "Aerospace Military University—farther north than here!"

The cleaver hit the floor. Iris rushed forward, eyes glistening, nearly tripping over the blade. Luna sidestepped. "Sis! The knife!"

"My brilliant girl!" Iris tossed the cleaver aside, cupping Luna's face to plant two loud kisses. "I knew you'd make it! That sharp mind of yours takes after..." Her voice faltered, her complexion paling.

"After who?" Luna tilted her head, noting how Iris twisted her apron strings.

"O-our mother, of course!" Iris fled back to the kitchen, chopping with renewed vigor.

Luna lowered her lashes. Her sister's reaction sent a pang through her chest. So Iris knew something about her origins.

A thud echoed from the yard as two small figures appeared—a tanned boy and a delicate but sallow-faced girl.

"Hannah! Charlie! Come meet your aunt!" Iris beamed with maternal pride. "She got into college!"

Hannah clenched her dress hem. Luna caught the flicker of resentment in her eyes.

"College?" the girl burst out. "We can't even afford meat because of the money sent to her! What'll happen if we get in?"

Silence fell. Luna dusted flour from her hands and crouched to Hannah's eye level. "From today onward, I'll pay for your schooling." She wiped dirt from the girl's cheek. "If you study hard, I'll get you both to university."

Hannah bit her lip and turned away, though her ears turned pink.

"Well, isn't this lively?" A booming voice carried from the gate. Henry Cooper stood there, carpentry tools slung over his shoulder, scanning the scene. "What'd I miss?"

Iris wiped her tears. "Henry, Luna got into college!"

Henry blinked, then roared with laughter. "Fantastic! We're making extra dumplings tonight!" He ruffled Hannah's hair. "Learn from your aunt, kiddo. Make your old man proud someday!"

Hannah stole a glance at Luna before quickly looking down. Luna noticed the girl's grip on her dress had loosened.
###Chapter 58: The Secret of Origins

"Dad!"

Hannah Cooper flew into Henry Cooper's arms like a joyful little bird. Henry lifted his daughter and spun her around, his face crinkling with laughter. Spotting Luna White standing nearby, he quickly set the child down and scratched the back of his head sheepishly.

Luna's eyes grew warm. The scene reminded her of her late adoptive father, who had once held her the same way. After turning fourteen, such warmth had become a rare luxury.

"You could've warned us you were coming back," Iris White chided, though her voice was softer than usual as she untied her apron and dusted off her husband's clothes.

Henry took the apron and brushed himself off. "The job wrapped up early. I was worried about you managing everything alone..." His gaze shifted to Luna. "And who's this?"

"Nice to meet you, brother-in-law. I'm Luna White." She stepped forward before Iris could introduce her.

"Well, I'll be!" Henry slapped his thigh. "Look how grown-up you are! Your sister never stops talking about you—says our Luna's the brightest and bound for college." His grin stretched ear to ear.

Luna smiled faintly. Memories from age six had long faded, but this kindhearted man made her feel at ease.

"Go wash up, brother-in-law. The dumplings are almost ready." She turned toward the kitchen, already planning ways to help improve her sister's household—especially for that paralyzed brother-in-law lying in the back room. If she could cure his illness...

Bang! Maya White stormed in, slamming a bucket onto the floor. She scowled at Henry but held her tongue.

The three children swiftly set the table. Luna paused as she carried out the dumplings—Maya had already devoured an entire bowl, while the kids shared another.

"Were you raised in a barn?" Luna shot Maya a cold look as she reached for more.

"None of your damn business!" Maya threw down her chopsticks. "Who said this was your house?"

Luna steadied the nearly overturned table. "This is my family. You don't get a say."

"Your family?" Maya let out a shrill laugh. "What are you, anyway? A nobody's bastard!"

The room plunged into deadly silence.

Luna's pulse raced, but her expression remained calm. "Say that again."

"I said you're a bastard!" Maya shrieked. "First your real mom, then your adoptive parents—you killed them all! Grandma always said you're a curse!"

Iris rushed to cover Maya's mouth. "Stop this nonsense!"

Maya shoved her away, jabbing a finger at Luna. "Ask your sister if you don't believe me! She knows better than anyone—you're not even a White!"

Luna's fingers turned icy, yet she smiled. Finally... the moment has come.
###Chapter 59: The Secret of Her Origins (Part 2)

Luna White suddenly laughed. It started as a soft chuckle, then escalated into hysterical laughter. Tears streamed down her face as her body trembled uncontrollably.

"So that's it... That explains everything..." she murmured to herself.

Iris White pulled Luna into a tight embrace, her voice shaking. "Luna, don't listen to her nonsense! You're my real sister, Mom and Dad's own daughter!" She clung to Luna desperately, as if letting go would make her disappear.

Maya White grew frustrated—this wasn't how she had imagined things would go. She had expected Iris to immediately kick this illegitimate child out of the house upon learning the truth.

"Second Sister, I'm telling the truth!" Maya stomped her foot in agitation. "I heard Grandma and Dad talking about it myself! Luna is the child of that Educated Youth from back then. Her real mother died in childbirth. Even Amy Miller, the women's director, knows about this!"

Luna slowly lifted her head from Iris's arms, her gaze eerily calm. "Second Sister, I believe her."

Iris's heart clenched. "Luna..."

"All these years, I've known how Grandma and Uncle treated me," Luna said softly, each word cutting like a knife. "How many nights did I lie in that tiny shed next to the pigpen, breathing in the stench, listening to the pigs squeal, wondering—am I really a White?"

Iris burst into tears. "It's not like that..."

Maya yanked Iris away triumphantly. "See, Second Sister? She admits it herself! Why are you still protecting this ungrateful wretch?"

Henry Cooper, sensing the tension, quickly ushered the children out of the room.

"Get out!" Iris suddenly roared, shoving Maya away. "You're not welcome in this house!"

Maya staggered back. "Second Sister! I'm your real sister! How could you—"

But Luna stopped Iris. "Let her finish. I want to know the truth."

Iris looked at her sister's icy expression and felt her heart shatter. They had kept this secret for so long, all to protect her...

"Luna..." Iris's voice trembled.

"Sister, you can't hide the truth forever," Luna said calmly. "Even if you don't tell me today, I can just ask Amy Miller myself."

Maya seized the opportunity to stir the pot. "Second Sister, look at her! The moment she finds out she's not blood-related, she's already thinking about finding her real father! What kind of heartless—"

Luna smirked coldly. "Maya, save your theatrics. I've already died once—what else is there to fear?"

"Died once?" Iris grabbed Luna's shoulders. "What do you mean?"

Luna took a deep breath. "A few days ago, Grandma forced me to go work in the city. When I refused, she beat me half to death. The next day, I was so hungry I made myself a bowl of noodles, and she screamed at me for being a freeloader..."

She recounted the events of that day with chilling composure. By the time she mentioned jumping into the reservoir, Iris was sobbing uncontrollably.

"If Captain Andrew hadn't saved me, you'd be looking at my corpse right now," Luna said quietly. "So trust me—there's nothing I can't handle."

Iris pulled her into a crushing embrace, weeping bitterly. "It's all my fault... I should have protected you better..."

Now she understood why Luna had changed. The timid, meek girl she once knew had died the moment she plunged into that water.

"We sent Grandma nineteen dollars every month!" Iris choked out between sobs. "Just so you wouldn't suffer... How could they... How could they..."

Luna gently patted her sister's back, but her eyes grew colder by the second.

So her origins truly were a lie.
###Chapter 60: The Secret of Her Birth

"Iris, have you lost your mind? She's just a bastard!" Maya's shrill voice shattered the silence in the room. "If Uncle Jack hadn't taken her in out of kindness, she would've died in the wilderness. We've been more than merciful to her!"

Maya's eyes gleamed with malice. She had been waiting for this moment to spew her venom.

"Grandma Clara said it herself—her shameless mother seduced an educated youth from the city and got pregnant before marriage. And what happened? The man went back to the city and married a proper girl from a good family. Her mother died in childbirth—what a joke!"

Maya grew more animated as she spoke, relishing the way Luna's face paled.

Luna clenched her fists. So this was the truth—her origins were this disgraceful. An abandoned child of an educated youth. No wonder the Whites had never treated her as family.

But then, a strange sense of relief washed over her. At least now she knew. No more lies, no more secrets.

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the room, cutting Maya off mid-sentence.

"You hit me?" Maya pressed a hand to her stinging cheek, gaping at Iris in disbelief.

"Get out!" Iris grabbed Maya's arm and shoved her toward the door. "From now on, I don't have a sister like you!"

Maya stumbled but caught herself, then spat on the ground. "Fine! Rot in poverty for all I care!" She snatched up her bag and stormed off.

Inside, Iris gently pulled Luna down onto a chair. "Luna..."

"Don't worry, Iris. I'm okay." Luna managed a small smile. "I had my suspicions for a while now."

Henry walked in carrying a steaming bowl of dumplings. "Eat first! Even if the sky falls, you need a full stomach."

The simple farmer didn’t know how to comfort with words, so he showed his care the only way he knew—with food.

Luna accepted the bowl. Through the rising steam, she saw the concern in Iris's eyes and felt warmth spread through her chest.

"Iris, Henry—you're my real family." She picked up a dumpling. "Blood doesn't matter. What matters is how you've treated me."

Iris's eyes welled up. "Silly girl..."

"Here, have more!" Henry slid another bowl toward her, secretly transferring some of his own portion into hers.

"Henry!" Luna stopped him. "If you keep this up, I'll get angry!"

All three of them laughed. Just then, three little figures came bounding into the room, filling it with laughter and chatter.

As Luna watched the scene, she made a silent vow: This time, I'll protect the people who truly love me.
###Chapter 61: A Gift from Beyond

Luna White let out a contented sigh as she finished the steaming plate of dumplings. The warm broth settled in her stomach, spreading comfort through her limbs, right down to her fingertips.

Henry Cooper and his children, Charlie and Hannah, quickly cleared the table and disappeared into the kitchen. Iris White started to follow, but Luna caught her wrist.

"Second Sister, I need to talk to you." Luna's tone was solemn as her gaze swept over Henry and Iris before landing on the hunched figure in the corner.

William Cooper had been carried into the main room, his body rigid with tension. The bright light made him squint, his fingers clutching the edge of his blanket as if he could vanish beneath it.

"Luna, what's this about?" Iris asked, her heart aching for her brother-in-law. For twelve years, she had cared for him like her own son, tending to his needs with unwavering devotion.

Luna took a deep breath, lowering her voice. "Second Sister, I wouldn’t be alive today if not for Mom and Dad."

Iris's hands trembled, and the chopsticks slipped from her grasp, clattering to the floor.

"At the gates of the afterlife, they used all the good karma they'd earned to pull me back from death," Luna whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "Before I left, they passed their medical knowledge to me—so I could heal others and do good in this world."

Tears spilled down Iris's cheeks. She remembered how their parents had clung to Luna’s small hands in their final moments, their love unwavering even then.

Henry rubbed his hands together, his eyes reddening. He would never forget the kindness of his in-laws, and now, even in death, they were still watching over their daughter.

William shrank further into his blanket, barely daring to breathe.

"Let me examine William," Luna said suddenly.

The room fell so silent they could have heard a pin drop.

William jerked his head up, then immediately ducked it again. He had seen too many doctors, endured too many dashed hopes.

"Can you really help him?" Henry's voice shook. He didn’t dare dream his brother might walk again—just being able to eat or use the bathroom on his own would be a miracle.

But Iris hesitated. Their father had known some basic remedies, but this…

"I’ll need a set of silver needles," Luna said.

Henry bolted out the door without even grabbing his coat.

"Luna…" Iris bit her lip, uncertain.

Luna leaned close to her sister’s ear. "We can’t tell anyone about this. If people find out I can communicate with the dead, they’ll lock me up for experiments."

Iris paled, as if she could already see her sister strapped to a lab table.

"Tell them you learned from Dad!" Iris blurted. "He did know some medicine—the whole family can vouch for that!"

Warmth flooded Luna’s chest. This was family—already crafting excuses to protect her.

William spoke up timidly. "Sister-in-law, I won’t say a word."

Iris relaxed. She knew her brother-in-law well—once he gave his word, he’d keep it.

Outside, Henry’s footsteps grew louder, carrying not just the needles, but the fragile hope of an entire family.
###Chapter 62: The Treatment

The three children had just finished cleaning the dishes and were about to gather around their aunt for a story when Iris White shooed them away sternly. "Go on, all of you—play outside in the yard!"

Hannah Cooper pouted, reluctant to leave. She had just witnessed her aunt slap Maya White clean across the room and heard from Daisy about how Luna had stood up to that shrew. Any previous disdain she'd held for her aunt had vanished, replaced by sheer admiration.

She had always assumed Luna was weak, but it turned out she was anything but. That slap had been swift and decisive—utterly satisfying. Not to mention, Luna was a university student—something everyone in town envied!

Seeing the children dawdling, Iris lost her patience—a rare occurrence. "Either go do your homework outside or help in the kitchen!" She wasn’t trying to be harsh, but she didn’t want them seeing something they shouldn’t and blabbing about it later.

Startled by their mother’s sudden sternness, the children obediently carried their small stools outside to do their homework.

Luna smiled and tugged at her sister’s sleeve. "Don’t be too hard on them, Iris. We can treat William after they leave for school this afternoon." She understood her sister was just looking out for her.

Iris sighed, feeling a pang of guilt. This was the first time she’d ever been so sharp with her children.

That afternoon, Charlie and Hannah left for school with their backpacks. Daisy, still too young for school, was sent out with Henry to keep her from disturbing the treatment. "Don’t come back before dark!" Iris instructed.

Henry agreed without hesitation. He had just spent a small fortune—twelve whole dollars—on a set of silver needles, enough to buy half a sack of flour. But for his brother’s sake, he’d gritted his teeth and made the purchase.

As Iris bustled around preparing for the treatment, Luna gave her instructions. "Boil a pot of water and make some ginger tea with brown sugar. Oh, and bring out the quilts too."

Though puzzled, Iris didn’t question her. She trusted her sister implicitly, without needing explanations.

Once everything was ready, Luna had William remove his shirt and began inserting the sterilized needles into his back. She had learned a bit about acupuncture in her past life, but only the basics. This was mostly for show.

Watching a dozen needles pierce William’s skin, Iris felt a surge of awe. When had her sister learned this? Even their parents hadn’t known such techniques. She was becoming more convinced that Luna’s story of a miraculous encounter was true.

Luna gently twisted the needles, channeling a warm current of energy into William’s body. His numb legs and lower back suddenly prickled with pain and itching, as if thousands of ants were crawling beneath his skin. Yet William was overjoyed—this was far better than feeling nothing at all!

He clenched his teeth, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. If he could walk again, he’d do anything to repay Luna.

The pain grew unbearable, and William finally let out a low groan. Iris paced anxiously, helpless to ease his suffering.

"Bite down on this," Luna said, handing him a wad of gauze. Her hands trembled violently. She knew the agony of healing a chronic condition was the worst part, and it drained her energy the most.

Henry slipped in quietly, his heart aching at the sight of his brother in pain. But he understood this was necessary, so he clenched his fists and stood by in silence.

By the time Luna removed the needles, her entire body was shaking. Iris finally noticed how deathly pale she looked—her lips tinged blue, as if she’d just been pulled from an icy river.

"Luna! What’s wrong?" Iris panicked.

"B-Blanket…" Luna’s teeth chattered. "Hot tea… soak my feet…"

Henry quickly wrapped Luna in a quilt, cocooning her until only her ghostly face remained visible. Iris brought a basin of scalding water and gasped when she touched her sister’s ice-cold feet—they felt like a corpse’s.

She frantically rubbed Luna’s soles until a faint flush returned to them. After gulping down a large bowl of hot ginger tea, Luna finally regained some color.

This time, she had prepared better and avoided freezing solid like before. But the bone-deep chill from overusing her energy still left her trembling uncontrollably.

Luna smiled weakly to herself. This time, I really gave it my all.
###Chapter 63: Between Fire and Ice

William Cooper jolted upright in bed, planting both feet firmly on the ground before darting to Luna White's side. "You look terrible—what's wrong?"

The room was eerily silent.

"Luna, talk to me!" William's voice trembled with urgency.

Luna's teeth chattered as she attempted a smile, her lips too stiff to move. "Your... legs..."

Only then did William glance down—he'd just walked. On his own feet.

Henry Cooper barreled forward, crushing his younger brother in a bear hug. The burly man wept like a child. "Will! Your legs—your back! It's a miracle!" He pounded William's back, tears and snot smearing his face.

William stood frozen. After years of herbalists promising gradual recovery, Luna's single treatment had him standing. His legs shook, but the long-lost strength made his eyes burn.

Thud. Both Cooper brothers dropped to their knees before Luna.

"We'll never forget this, Luna," Henry choked out, bowing his head.

Luna's lips turned blue. "H-hot water... bottle... freezing..."

Henry scrambled up. "Right! Water bottle!"

Iris White wrung out a steaming towel, tears dripping as she rubbed Luna's limbs. "Don't scare me like this..."

"S-side effect," Luna's teeth clattered. "L-low body temp... ginger tea..."

Henry returned with three rubber bottles, which Iris shoved under the blankets. Luna clutched the heat source, color slowly returning to her face.

After two mugs of spiced tea, beads of sweat dotted Luna's forehead. She flexed her fingers—the stiffness was fading.

This episode had been the worst yet. But for Iris? Worth it.

"You're sure you're okay?" Iris trembled. "You were white as parchment..."

Luna kicked off the covers. "See? Sweating means I'm recovering. Just part of the ability's cost."

Henry rubbed his hands. "I'll get you a chicken stew—"

"Henry." Luna caught his sleeve. "You housed me for four years. This is nothing. Your family's happiness is all I want."

Henry's eyes welled up again. He looked at William—the brother who'd been bedridden, now standing tall.

The Coopers would remember this debt forever.
###Chapter 64: The Secret of Her Origins

Henry Cooper rubbed his hands together, his dark face etched with unease. "This isn't the same! Taking care of you was our promise to Mom and Dad—a matter of honor. But today, you saved my brother. That’s a debt we can never repay!" His eyes reddened with emotion, and he looked ready to drop to his knees again.

William Cooper hobbled over on his crutches, lips trembling as he shook his head repeatedly. "No... no..." His rough hands clenched the hem of his shirt, knuckles turning white.

Luna White watched the brothers with a mix of amusement and exasperation.

"Brother-in-law, there’s no need to buy anything. I brought formula and canned food." She pointed to the mesh bag on the table. "William may be walking now, but he’s still weak. He needs to recover slowly—no rushing."

The brothers nodded earnestly, like schoolboys listening to their teacher.

Luna glanced at the thick quilt on the bed and suddenly burst into laughter. Iris White joined in, chuckling.

The Cooper brothers exchanged confused looks.

"If anyone walked in now and saw me wrapped in a winter quilt with a hot water bottle in summer, they’d think I’d lost my mind!" Luna laughed so hard she clutched her stomach.

Iris briskly folded the bedding and waved the brothers off. "Enough dawdling. Go return what you borrowed and bring the kids home." She turned to William. "You—rest. Didn’t you hear Luna say you need to take it slow?"

Once they were alone, Luna grabbed Iris’s hand.

"Sis, you knew I wasn’t their biological child, didn’t you?" Her gaze was unwavering.

Iris sighed and pulled her down to sit.

"Luna, don’t dwell on it. You’re our sister—always have been, always will be." Her voice trembled.

"I’ll always be your little sister," Luna said, squeezing her hand. "But I want the truth. Grandma and Uncle Jack knew, but I was kept in the dark. They treated me like a servant—now I understand why."

"A servant?!" Iris shot to her feet. "What did they do to you? Every time you came home, you said you were fine, but I knew you were too thin..." Her voice cracked, and she punched her thigh in frustration.

Luna recounted everything—the years of hardship, the withheld education, the relentless labor. When she mentioned Grandma Clara refusing to let her attend school for money, Iris shook with rage.

"I’ll make them pay!" Iris wiped her tears and stormed toward the door.

Luna quickly stopped her. "Sis, Grandma’s in the hospital now."

Iris relented but frowned. No matter how awful she was, ignoring an ailing elder wasn’t right.

"Luna, just focus on your studies," Iris said, smoothing her sister’s hair. "About your birth... all I know is your real mother was named Yan Fengying. She was an Educated Youth from the city."

Lowering her voice, Iris recounted the past. During the mass return of Educated Youth, no one knew Yan Fengying was pregnant. On the night she went into labor, their father was called to help...

"Your mother didn’t make it. The women’s director wanted to adopt you, but it fell through. Dad brought you home instead." Iris wiped her tears. "Not many in the village know. Don’t let it weigh on you. To us, you’re family!"

Luna could no longer hold back. She threw herself into Iris’s arms and sobbed. These siblings—who had given everything for her in her past life—loved her unconditionally.

"Sis, we’ll always be family!" She clung to Iris as if she’d found a priceless treasure.
###Chapter 65: A Debt Beyond Repayment

The sisters' eyes were swollen from crying before they finally wiped their tears and composed themselves.

Iris looked at Luna's reddened eyes, and Luna stared back at Iris's equally puffy ones. They exchanged glances and suddenly burst into laughter, looking like two little rabbits with crimson eyes.

Henry returned with little Daisy in tow. The cheerful girl had been playing outside but immediately noticed her mother and aunt's reddened eyes. Tilting her head, she asked in her sweet, childish voice, "Mommy, Auntie, what happened to your eyes?" She reached out with tiny fingers to gently touch Iris's face, her innocent concern melting their hearts.

Luna scooped Daisy into her arms, pretending to tickle her. "We were just playing like this and laughed until we cried! Want to try?"

The little girl, extremely ticklish, squirmed with laughter and hid behind Iris, begging for mercy. Peeking out with wide eyes, she said, "Mommy, so you were playing tickle fights! Next time, wait for me—I'll help you beat Auntie so she can't make you cry!"

Luna feigned indignation. "Oh, you little troublemaker! Just wait till I get you!"

Daisy stuck out her tongue and clung tightly to Iris's sleeve, refusing to let go. The room filled with joyous laughter.

From his room, William overheard the cheerful sounds and couldn’t help but smile. This was what home should feel like—unlike the suffocating atmosphere of the past few weeks. He touched his thigh, where the once-limp muscles now had firmness. Pinching himself, he winced at the sharp pain but grinned wider. Being able to feel pain again is a blessing.

For dinner, Iris prepared extra dishes. When Henry had invited Aunt Martha’s family over earlier, he’d simply mentioned that Luna had learned acupuncture from her late father and had tried treating William. At first, they were skeptical—how could a young woman like Luna possess such skill?

But when they saw William walking shakily into the room and even pouring wine for Aunt Martha, the older woman burst into tears, hugging him like a child. Luna stood awkwardly to the side, unsure how to react.

"A living saint!" Aunt Martha clasped Luna’s hands tightly. "William, you must never forget this kindness for as long as you live!"

William immediately tried to kneel, but Luna stopped him. "Don’t! If you keep this up, I’ll leave. I only helped for Iris’s sake." In truth, had it not been for her sister, she wouldn’t have bothered. Her heart had long grown cold after her reincarnation.

Iris quickly intervened. "Aunt, if you keep saying things like that, my sister really will leave."

Aunt Martha finally relented. The meal passed in warm harmony, the food tasting all the sweeter for it.

After dinner, Aunt Martha glanced at the darkening sky. "Iris, your place is small. Let your sister stay at mine. My daughter’s room is empty since she’s away."

Before Iris could decline, Henry cut in. "You two go ahead. William and I will clean up and join you later." He knew his wife worried about him, but he wanted the sisters to have more time together.

Aunt Martha chuckled. "Good to see you treating your wife right. Come on, ladies—let the men handle the chores!" She ushered Iris and Luna out the door.

The night was deep as the three women walked by the dim glow of Aunt Martha’s flashlight, their steps uneven on the uneven path. Her home was far more spacious than Henry’s—a small courtyard enclosed by three tiled rooms.

As soon as they entered, the smell of tobacco hit them. Aunt Martha’s husband and the factory accountant sat smoking, their expressions grim. They gave only curt nods before the accountant stood.

"Old Zhao, I’ll come get you later. After all these years, we should at least pay our respects. Such a shame… so young…" His voice trailed off as he left.
###Chapter 66: The True Healer

Aunt Martha Cooper discreetly tugged at her husband's sleeve and whispered, "That's Iris's younger sister, Luna White. She's extraordinary—just got accepted into medical school this year and is already a miracle worker. William, who'd been paralyzed for over a decade, started walking after just one of her acupuncture treatments."

David Moore didn't even glance up, skepticism dripping from his thoughts. How skilled could some young girl really be? "Iris," he said dismissively, "take your sister to the other room. We've got grown-up matters to discuss here." He waved them off, assuming they were just poor relatives looking for a place to stay.

The Cooper brothers—one paralyzed for years, the other orphaned—had long relied on Aunt Martha's support. David kept his annoyance hidden, but he'd had enough of these so-called burdens.

Iris obediently led Luna to the adjacent room. Aunt Martha brought two thin quilts; the space was tidy and clearly belonged to a young woman—books lined the shelves, and a vase of vibrant plastic flowers brightened the desk.

Once the sisters were settled, Aunt Martha returned to find David shrugging on his coat. "Where are you going at this hour?" she asked, puzzled.

"Give me five dollars, quick!" he barked. "Factory Manager Green's brother-in-law is running a high fever with nosebleeds. The hospital's already issued a critical condition notice—he's the Wang family's only heir!"

As she fumbled with the lockbox, Aunt Martha fretted, "I've met that boy—polite and well-mannered. The Wangs are influential in the provincial capital. How will they handle this...?"

"Exactly!" David stuffed the money into his pocket. "A healthy young man in his twenties, just like that. The Wangs are on their way—I need to go now."

Aunt Martha suddenly grabbed his arm. "Wait! What about Luna? She’s got real medical talent. Why not take her?"

"Are you insane?" He shook her off. "Some country girl playing doctor? We’d be inviting trouble!"

"You have no idea!" She stamped her foot. "William walked after one treatment—one! The hospital’s given up anyway. What’s there to lose?"

David’s eyes widened. "William’s really walking? You’d better not be lying."

"Would I make that up?" She squared her shoulders. "Go see for yourself if you don’t believe me! That girl must have secret family techniques—how else would she get into medical school?"

David stroked his chin, wheels turning. If Luna could save the Wang heir... his position at the factory might just... He slapped his thigh. "Fine! I’ll take her to the hospital!"
###Chapter 67: Seeing Is Believing

David Moore rubbed his hands anxiously. "Alright, I'll go check things out first. If it doesn't work, we’ll ask Luna White to come. Just say we need her help—if she can treat him, great. If not, no pressure. Saving a life is worth more than anything else. Even if it’s not for our boy’s job, it’s still a human life." He paused, frowning. "I’m just worried that girl might be difficult. Educated folks can be proud—what if she looks down on people like us?"

Aunt Martha cut him off. "Nonsense! Luna’s the sweetest girl—polite at meals and in conversation. Nothing like what you’re imagining."

David shook his head. "You think everyone’s a saint. I’m heading out—no time to argue." He rushed off, but instead of going to the hospital, he made a beeline for Henry Cooper’s house.

He needed to see it for himself. As the saying went, seeing is believing.

Just as he reached the door, the curtain was pushed aside. A figure stepped out carrying a basin. In the dim light from inside, David immediately recognized William Cooper.

His heart warmed.

William startled, nearly dropping the basin. "Uncle David? What brings you here? Come in!" He thought to himself: Standing at the door in the middle of the night—scaring people half to death.

David circled William twice, clicking his tongue in amazement. "Will, you’re really better? No pain anywhere?" He hadn’t believed Aunt Martha earlier, but now, seeing it with his own eyes, he had no choice.

A man paralyzed for over a decade—now walking. That medical skill was nothing short of miraculous.

William smiled shyly. "Much better. Just weak in the legs and overall fatigue. Dr. White said with more rest and exercise, I’ll be as good as normal." His eyes grew moist as he spoke.

"Walk a bit—let me see." David still wasn’t convinced.

William carried the basin outside, poured the water smoothly, then walked back steadily.

David slapped his thigh. "Good! That’s fantastic!" He turned to leave immediately.

"Uncle, won’t you come in?"

"No, no—got things to do. Come over tomorrow for dinner—we’ll celebrate properly!" Before the words fully left his mouth, he was already gone.

William shook his head, amused. His uncle was always in such a hurry.

"Who was that?" Henry poked his head out.

"Uncle David. Said a few words and left."

Henry frowned. "What’s so urgent this late?"

The brothers tiptoed back inside. The three children were already asleep.

Henry collapsed onto the bed, snoring loudly. The weight that had crushed him for over a decade was finally lifted—he slept more soundly than ever.

But William tossed and turned. Anyone who’d experienced such a miracle would be too excited to sleep.

......

David flicked on his flashlight, running into Old Harold and a few others on the way—all old factory buddies heading to Factory Manager Victor Green’s place to help.

The Green residence was brightly lit. The moment David stepped in, he saw Victor’s ashen face. Everyone exchanged silent glances—no one spoke unnecessarily.

Victor felt like a boulder sat on his chest. His brother-in-law was the only son in his wife’s family, doted on by three older sisters. A perfectly healthy man, just visiting relatives—and now this. How was he supposed to explain this to his father-in-law?

The hospital had given up. When they brought him home, he was barely clinging to life.

The thought of his father-in-law’s fury made Victor’s back run cold. The old man was the family’s pillar—if anything happened to him because of this… his brothers-in-law would tear him apart.

David glanced around the crowded room, realizing he wasn’t needed here. He had to hurry back and find Luna.

He excused himself to Old Harold, claiming he’d forgotten something, and slipped away.

Victor watched David’s retreating figure bitterly. That sly fox—bolting at the first sign of trouble. Acts all humble usually, but shows his true colors when it counts.

Little did he know, David’s departure would bring back a twist of fate beyond imagination.
###Chapter 68: Beyond Cure

David Moore had no idea what Factory Manager Victor Green was thinking.

He rushed home in a panic to find Aunt Martha still awake, mending clothes by lamplight. Seeing her husband return drenched in sweat, she knew something was wrong.

"What happened?" She set down her needle.

David gulped down some water. "That boy's on death's door. It doesn't look good."

Aunt Martha sighed. "Should we... ask Luna?"

"Go ask her now!" David wrung his hands anxiously. "He's barely twenty!"

Aunt Martha tiptoed to the next room and knocked softly.

"Luna? Wake up, dear. I need your help."

Rustling sounds came from inside before Iris White rubbed her eyes and opened the door.

"Auntie, it's so late..."

Entering, Aunt Martha saw Luna sitting up groggily, her cheeks still flushed from sleep.

"Luna, Factory Manager Green's brother-in-law is gravely ill. Could you—"

Still half-asleep, Luna shook her head instinctively. "Auntie, I used all my energy treating William today. I can barely move..."

Iris immediately protested, "No way! Luna nearly passed out after the treatment today. She can't do another!"

Aunt Martha twisted her hands nervously. "But that boy..."

"Auntie," Luna said weakly, "my technique is special. I can only perform it once a day. If I force it, I could..."

She left the sentence unfinished, but the implication was clear.

Aunt Martha's expression shifted before she finally sighed. "Then... rest well."

Back in their room, David asked eagerly, "Well?"

"It's no use." Aunt Martha shook her head. "Luna says she can only perform the treatment once a day."

David grew agitated. "That makes no sense! Is she—"

"Don't you dare!" Aunt Martha cut him off. "Iris said Luna almost fainted after today's session. We can't gamble with her life."

David clawed at his hair in frustration. "But Factory Manager Green—"

"We'll talk tomorrow." Aunt Martha handed him a cup of water. "If that boy's strong enough, he'll make it till morning."

With no other choice, David hurried back to the Green residence.

Meanwhile, Iris quietly shut the door and whispered, "Luna, were you telling the truth?"

In the darkness, Luna blinked. "Why would I lie, Iris? You saw how pale I was today."

Remembering her sister's ashen face, Iris's heart ached. "Then forget it! No one's life is more important than yours!"

Luna giggled. "Iris, you're so dramatic."

She hadn't told the whole truth. The technique was draining, but with proper nourishment, it wouldn't be life-threatening. Still...

Rolling onto her side, she stared at the pitch-black ceiling.

Desperation never made for good business. If they wanted her help, they'd have to beg for it properly.

###Chapter 69: The Family Secret
David Moore trudged back to Factory Manager Victor Green's house with his head hanging low. The moment he stepped inside, he was stunned by the sound of wailing filling the rooms. Victor Green froze at the sight of him, then his expression softened slightly—this kid hadn't actually run away.

Just as dawn broke, General Charles Turner arrived with his entire family in tow. Four jeeps screeched to a halt outside, the sheer scale of the commotion enough to make anyone nervous. Helen Turner barged in, her voice shrill as she cried, "Where's my son?" Her eyes were red-rimmed, swollen from crying.

Fiona Turner quickly pulled her mother and two sisters into the inner room. The moment Helen saw her son's pale, lifeless face, her legs gave out. "My boy! You're killing me!" she wailed, her grief so raw that even her three daughters couldn't hold her back.

Snow and Grace Turner also broke into tears. Their little brother was the family's treasure—kind, sensible, and beloved. If he really left them like this...

"Mom! Please!" Fiona stomped her foot in desperation. But Helen had already fainted from the overwhelming sorrow and was carried to the next room. The factory doctor examined her and declared it was just emotional exhaustion—nothing life-threatening.

In the living room, General Charles Turner interrogated his son-in-law with a face like thunder. Victor Green broke out in a cold sweat as he explained everything. None of this was their fault—who would've thought a nosebleed could be fatal?

"The specialists?" the old general suddenly demanded, making Victor flinch.

Richard Adams, the eldest son-in-law, glanced outside. "They should be here soon, Dad." For his brother-in-law, the general had summoned the best doctors from the provincial capital, and they were rushing over now.

General Turner sat by his son's bedside, gripping the cold hand tightly. He'd had this child late in life, and the boy had never given him a moment's worry—until now.

The old man's throat worked, but not a single tear fell.

By full daylight, five military trucks roared into the compound. White-coated specialists filed in, stethoscopes moving over the patient's chest before they all stepped back, shaking their heads.

"Prepare for the worst," the lead doctor said quietly. "A stimulant might buy him a few last words."

General Turner swayed on his feet, steadied by those around him. The doctor quickly handed him medication. "Sir, your heart condition—"

The old man suddenly laughed, the sound more painful than any sob. He'd survived war and bloodshed, yet now he couldn't save his own son.

David Moore stared blankly out the window. It was already 5:30 a.m., summer mornings arriving early. Watching the once-indomitable general's hunched shoulders, all his petty thoughts evaporated.

"General Turner!" he blurted out before he could stop himself.

Richard immediately scowled. "Not now!"

"But... there might still be hope," David stammered.

The general's head snapped up, his gaze sharp as a blade. "What did you say?"

"I know an old physician—family secrets, acupuncture techniques..." David's legs trembled under that stare.

Richard scoffed. "Western medicine failed, and you think a few needles will bring him back?"

But the general seized David's wrist, veins bulging. "Where is he?"
###Chapter 70: Defying Doubt

"Where is she?" Charles Turner's voice was hoarse, his bloodshot eyes fixed on David Moore. Even if there was only the slimmest chance, he couldn't give up.

"In my house!"

Richard Adams let out a cold laugh.

"Master Moore, still trying to curry favor at a time like this? Don't tell me this so-called 'miracle doctor' is your relative?"

David's face burned with humiliation. He barely believed it himself. But with lives at stake, he had no choice. "She's my nephew's sister-in-law. My nephew was paralyzed for over a decade. Yesterday, she gave him one acupuncture session—last night, I saw him walk with my own eyes!"

Richard's lips curled in mockery. "Keep spinning your tales. I've seen enough of these scams."

Charles slammed the table. "Bring her here. Now!"

"Dad!" Richard protested. "You're buying this nonsense? It's obviously a setup!"

David trembled with anger. "Everyone at the factory knows about my nephew. Who fakes an illness for ten years?"

The workers around them murmured in agreement:

"Old Moore's nephew really was paralyzed for years."

"That kid never left the house."

"But this 'miracle doctor'..."

Their skeptical stares pricked at David like needles. He gritted his teeth. "I'll bring my nephew here. But if we delay treatment—"

"Fetch the doctor!" Charles cut him off, his voice edged with desperate resolve.

Grudgingly, Richard followed David out, his glare sharp as a blade. "Master Moore, if this turns out to be a fraud—"

David cursed inwardly. The first time he tried to do a good deed, and he ended up the villain.

In the courtyard, Luna White was helping her sister wash her face.

"Luna, this is..." David awkwardly introduced, "He's here to ask for your help."

Luna looked up and met a pair of disdainful eyes.

Richard scanned her up and down and scoffed. "This? The 'miracle doctor'? At least put some effort into your lies!"

Luna calmly dried her hands. "The exit's over there. Don't let the door hit you."

"Can't keep up the act?" Richard sneered. "A kid pretending to be a doctor?"

David wished the ground would swallow him.

Suddenly, Luna smiled. "Your patient—high fever, convulsions?"

Richard paled.

"Dilated pupils, purple lips?" she continued. "They won't last two more hours."

Richard staggered back, staring at her as if she were a ghost. "How do you know?"

Luna tossed the towel aside. "Now, get out and beg on your knees."
###Chapter 71: Life or Death

Richard Adams had just stepped over the threshold when he froze.

A sudden thought struck him—his father-in-law was stubborn. If he returned empty-handed, the old man would likely come to fetch this so-called "miracle doctor" himself. Better to bring the woman back now and let the general see for himself what kind of "doctor" this backwater village could produce.

"You call yourself a miracle doctor?" Richard sneered. "Then hurry up and come with me! A life is at stake, and you’re putting on airs?"

Luna White clenched her teeth, resisting the urge to slap him.

David Moore quickly grabbed her arm, pleading in a hushed voice, "Luna, please. It’s my fault. Just go take a look—for my sake. The boy is so young. If something really happens to him..." Both his sons worked at the factory. If this situation turned ugly, their livelihoods would be at risk.

Aunt Martha Cooper chimed in, her eyes red. "Luna, do it for me. Your uncle was foolish. We’ll never do this again." She shot David a sharp glare.

Iris White gently tugged her sister’s sleeve. "Luna, Aunt Martha and Uncle David have helped us a lot over the years..."

Luna sighed and turned to retrieve her acupuncture kit—a gift from her brother-in-law, Henry Cooper, just the day before.

"Fine," she said coldly. "Only because of Iris and Aunt Martha."

Aunt Martha nodded eagerly. "Luna, I won’t forget this."

Richard snorted and strode ahead without another word.

David hurried after him, leading Luna at a brisk pace toward Factory Manager Victor Green’s house.

The moment they stepped inside, every eye in the room locked onto them.

"Dad, I brought her," Richard muttered to General Charles Turner. "Looks like a fraud to me..."

Charles took one look at Luna, and his heart sank. This girl seemed younger than his own daughter—what could she possibly know?

Then, a heart-wrenching scream tore through the house. Fiona Turner burst out of the inner room, her face pale. "Doctor! Hurry! My brother—he’s dying!"

Five physicians rushed inside. Moments later, the lead doctor emerged, grim-faced. "General Turner... your son has, at most, thirty minutes left. We’ve done all we can."

Charles swayed, nearly collapsing.

Luna glanced past them into the room. The young man on the bed was deathly pale, his breathing barely perceptible.

"Let me try," she said calmly. "Right now, I’m his only chance."

Richard exploded. "Get out! How dare you play games at a time like this!"

Luna nodded and turned to leave.

Life and death were fated. Some things couldn’t be helped.
###Chapter 72: Unexpected Assistance

"Stop!" A sharp command rang out. Luna White felt her wrist seized in a firm grip. Turning in surprise, she found Andrew Smith standing behind her, pulling her decisively toward General Charles Turner.

Her heart skipped a beat. Him again!

This PLA officer seemed to appear out of nowhere whenever trouble arose—like some kind of human radar drawn to chaos.

"Uncle Charles, I've witnessed Luna save lives with my own eyes," Andrew declared in a steady, authoritative voice. "Last time, she revived a heart attack victim with just a few acupuncture needles. Given Nathaniel's critical condition, forgive my bluntness, but even as a last resort, you should let her try."

His words were brutally honest, causing visible discomfort among those present.

Richard Adams stomped his foot in outrage. "Andrew! Have you lost your mind? After all our family's shared history, you'd side with this charlatan?"

"Brother-in-law," Andrew met his gaze unflinchingly, "Luna is my fiancée. I've seen her medical skills firsthand—they're genuine."

Luna resisted the urge to facepalm. Could her fiancé be any more straightforward? When no one believed her, he still charged headfirst into the fray.

General Turner's eyes remained tightly shut, his chest heaving. When they finally opened, resolution burned within them.

"Do it," the elder stated decisively.

The military physicians shook their heads disapprovingly. This reckless girl hadn't even properly examined the patient! Nathaniel was hanging by a thread—one wrong move could...

Ignoring the skepticism, Luna swiftly produced her silver needles. "Prepare blankets, hot water bottles, ginger tea with brown sugar, and chocolate—quickly!"

Richard nearly laughed aloud. This wasn't medical treatment—it sounded like remedies for a common cold!

Even General Turner frowned, but Andrew immediately barked orders: "Get those items now!"

Luna marched into the hospital room. The space overflowed with people—five military specialists clustered around the bed, Helen Turner clutching her son's hand desperately, his three sisters weeping uncontrollably.

"Clear the room!" Luna commanded without ceremony. "Only one family member stays."

Helen's head snapped up. "Who are you? What are you doing to my son?"

Andrew stepped forward quickly. "Aunt Helen, this is the doctor we've brought to treat Nathaniel."

Understanding dawned on the sisters, who immediately began guiding their mother out. "Mom, let's wait outside."

"I won't leave!" Helen struggled against them. "The specialists said there's no hope! Where did you find this girl to deceive me? If I miss my son's last—"

"Mom!" Fiona Turner interrupted firmly. "Dad's trying to save him!"

"Maybe she really has some skill," Snow Turner added supportively.

Grace Turner simply took her mother's arm. "Just wait calmly. I'll check on him regularly."

After considerable persuasion, they finally managed to usher out the distraught mother. The five specialists were also politely asked to leave, leaving only Andrew to assist.

"What do you need?" Andrew asked. Though he hadn't witnessed Luna's previous healing session, he'd seen the recovered Paul Jackson afterward.

"Remove his shirt and turn him face down," Luna instructed, already preparing her needles.

Andrew worked efficiently. As the fabric lifted, his breath caught—Nathaniel's ribs protruded starkly after just three days of illness.

The first needle descended. Nathaniel's body twitched slightly before stilling again.

One hour later.

Luna began trembling violently. An unnatural cold seeped from her marrow, as if ice melted within her veins. She despised this sensation but couldn't control it—the inevitable price of using her supernatural ability.

This wasn't ordinary shivering, but a soul-deep freeze that threatened to crystallize her very heart. Thankfully, Andrew's rural remedy from last time had inspired her preventive measures to mitigate the symptoms.

As the thought formed, a thick blanket enveloped her. Andrew worked swiftly, wrapping her completely until not even her fingertips remained exposed.

###Chapter 73: Warmth

Luna White saw her own deathly pale face reflected in Andrew Smith's deep eyes. "He... will be fine..." Her teeth chattered uncontrollably, her entire body aching from tension.

Andrew gave a silent nod and handed her a steaming cup of brown sugar water. But her trembling fingers nearly spilled it. With a sigh, he took the cup and held it to her lips. "Drink." Once again, this girl had performed a miracle before his eyes. He had watched as her silver needles pierced precise acupoints, her fingers deftly twisting the tails. Nathaniel Turner, who had been on the brink of death, gradually regained steady breaths, a faint flush returning to his pallid face.

After helping her finish the drink, Andrew strode out of the ward.

Outside, the crowd held their breaths. General Charles Turner rushed forward, hope blazing in his eyes. The boy he had watched grow up was now his only lifeline.

"He's stable," Andrew said simply. "Luna said to prepare some plain congee. He should wake by noon."

Helen Turner shot to her feet. "Really? Nathaniel is really okay?" Her voice shook.

"Go see for yourself, ma'am," Andrew replied gently. "Luna needs rest now. She’s exhausted."

David Moore squared his shoulders. "I'll take her home."

"She can't walk right now," Andrew refused.

Fiona Turner spoke up immediately. "She can rest in our room." This girl had saved their entire family.

When the group entered the ward, they found Luna curled up in a chair, wrapped tightly in blankets and shivering violently. Her ghostly face silenced them all—how much strength had this cost her?

Helen rushed to her son’s bedside. Nathaniel’s breathing was steady, his complexion healthy, with no trace of his near-death state. The five specialists exchanged glances and hurried to examine him.

Andrew had already carried Luna to the adjacent bedroom. Only then did everyone realize the blankets had been prepared for the doctor. Many marveled inwardly: This is what a true miracle worker looks like.

No one knew the agony Luna was enduring.

The moment Andrew set her down, she suddenly burst into tears.

"What’s wrong?" He gathered her and the blankets in alarm.

"My... leg... cramping..." Beads of sweat dotted her forehead as she clenched the sheets in pain.

Andrew immediately massaged her calf. But just as the spasm eased, another seized her. She bit her lip, tears streaming down her face. He could only keep kneading her muscles, gently flexing her joints.

Perhaps it was his soothing touch, or perhaps because no one had ever cared for her like this, but Luna sobbed harder.

Seeing her suffering, Andrew made a decision. He pulled back the covers and drew her into his arms. As she gasped in surprise, he tucked a hot water bottle against her and wrapped them both tightly in the quilt.

"You—" She tried to protest, but her chattering teeth cut her off.

"Relax." His steady voice rumbled above her.

His scorching warmth made her dizzy. Heat seeped into her bones, driving out the icy chill. His strong arms held her firmly, shielding her from each tremor.

"It’ll pass soon," he murmured, wiping her tears with a towel.

After several rounds, the shaking finally subsided. Luna slumped weakly against his chest, her ear pressed to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. The warmth lulled her into drowsiness, and she vaguely felt a hand patting her back.

"Sleep..."

She drifted off.

Andrew exhaled slowly and carefully laid her down. Watching the color return to her cheeks, a flicker of tenderness crossed his gaze. Having witnessed her needlework firsthand, he understood better than anyone the price she had paid.

The need to protect her burned clearer than ever.
###Chapter 74: A Miraculous Awakening

Andrew Smith froze in his tracks as he stepped out the door. Five silver-haired specialists surrounded him, their eyes gleaming with fervent excitement.

"He's really cured!"
"This is a medical miracle!"
"Let us meet the miracle doctor!"

Andrew pressed a finger to his lips. "Shh—she needs rest."

Disappointment flashed across the experts' faces, but they suppressed their enthusiasm. All five had examined Nathaniel Smith's condition and unanimously declared it hopeless. Yet now, the young man on the brink of death had miraculously revived.

General Charles Turner and Richard Adams hurried over. "How is the young doctor?"

Andrew sighed. "She's exhausted and resting now. She nearly collapsed from hypothermia earlier—thankfully, we were prepared."

"Fiancée?" Charles suddenly realized. "Why didn’t your father mention this?"

Before Andrew could explain, a cry came from the hospital room: "Nathaniel is awake!"

They rushed inside. Nathaniel lay in bed, blinking in confusion at the crowd. "Why is everyone here?"

Helen Turner trembled as she grasped her son’s hand. "How do you feel?"

"Just… really hungry," Nathaniel admitted sheepishly, scratching his head.

"Quick! Plain congee!" Helen ordered. Fiona Turner hurried off to prepare it, the weight in her chest finally lifting. If anything had happened to her brother under her care, she could never forgive herself.

Nathaniel devoured the bowl of congee, then looked pleadingly at his mother. "Mom, can I have some meat—"

"No!" Fiona cut in firmly. "The doctor specifically said only congee for now."

Helen was about to protest, but Nathaniel nodded obediently. "You're right, sis. I'll follow the doctor's orders."

Watching her son’s understanding response, Helen’s eyes welled up again. If saving her boy meant enshrining that young doctor as a saint, she’d do it in a heartbeat.
###Chapter 75: The Life-Saving Hero

Nathaniel Smith leaned weakly against the headboard while Helen Turner carefully tucked the blanket around him.

"Mom, what exactly happened to me?" he asked hoarsely. Seeing his parents, sister, and brother-in-law gathered around the bed, he sensed something serious had occurred.

At his question, Helen's eyes welled up with tears again. She wiped them away and said, "You almost... If it weren't for your brother-in-law's colleague's relative—a brilliant doctor—you might have..."

Charles Turner, relieved to see his son's improved condition, finally let out a breath. "Once you recover, you must properly thank her."

Nathaniel nodded. Though he couldn't recall the details, the fact that his entire family had rushed here meant it must have been dire. No wonder he'd felt like he was dying during his unconsciousness—until a sudden, cooling sensation had spread through his body.

"Understood," he murmured softly.

Helen suddenly stood up. "Should we call the doctor back? What if there are complications..." She wrung her hands nervously.

The five military medical experts nearby nodded eagerly. They were desperate for another chance to meet the mysterious female doctor.

Charles glanced at Andrew Smith. Since this involved his fiancée, he couldn’t force the matter.

"I'll ask," Andrew said, heading out. He wouldn’t make decisions for Luna.

Helen frowned at her husband. "Why has Andrew been running around handling everything?"

Richard Adams chimed in immediately, "That doctor is Andrew’s fiancée!" He was now utterly in awe of Luna, having completely forgotten his earlier skepticism.

"What?" Helen's eyes widened in shock. "Andrew is engaged to such an incredible doctor?"

Richard lowered his voice conspiratorially. "Exactly. Everyone thought he’d end up with Rain Johnson..."

Just then, Andrew returned.

"Luna says Nathaniel is fine now. Just stick to light meals for the next couple of days," he relayed.

Helen immediately turned to her son. "You heard that? Plain congee only!"

Nathaniel slumped back against the pillows, then suddenly perked up. "Andrew, since when did you have a fiancée?"

Andrew chuckled and shook his head. "Focus on resting. Don’t worry about it."

In the next room, Luna White was tying her hair into a ponytail in front of the mirror. She felt she’d recovered unusually fast this time—Andrew really was her lucky charm.

"All set?" Andrew pushed the door open and found her already refreshed and ready.

"Yeah, just a bit weak earlier. I’m fine now," she said with a smile.

"There’s a whole crowd outside waiting to meet you," Andrew reminded her.

Luna rolled her eyes. "Those experts?"

Before she could say more, Fiona Turner knocked and entered. "Dr. White, lunch is ready. Please come out and eat."

Andrew winked at Luna. "You should at least give them a chance to thank you."

Luna sighed and shrugged. Andrew opened the door for her and gestured grandly. "After you."

The playful gesture made her laugh. She was realizing that this disciplined military man wasn’t just attentive—he also had a knack for lifting her spirits, completely shattering her stereotypes about soldiers.

Fiona, waiting anxiously outside, finally relaxed when they emerged. She stole curious glances at Luna, eager to get a proper look at the woman who’d saved her brother’s life.
###Chapter 76: A Life Saved

The moment Luna White stepped out of the ward, Fiona Turner's eyes lit up.

At first glance, the girl seemed unremarkable—delicate features overshadowed by her tanned skin and slender frame. Yet this seemingly ordinary young woman had miraculously saved her brother's life.

Appearances truly could be deceiving.

Fiona rushed forward in three quick strides, grabbing Luna's hand with the familiarity of an old friend.

"Dr. White! We've been waiting for you! The old man was nearly frantic—your skills are nothing short of miraculous!" Without waiting for a response, she tugged Luna toward the dining area. "You must be starving after working all morning. Let's talk over lunch!"

Five military medical specialists exchanged anxious glances. They'd waited half the day to consult this prodigious healer—they couldn't let her slip away now.

"Dr. White!" The lead expert blocked their path. "We're from the Provincial Military Hospital. We'd appreciate your insights on Nathaniel's case—it could advance medical—"

He flushed mid-sentence. Asking someone to reveal their trade secrets was beyond audacious.

Luna regarded them with calm, transparent eyes—no arrogance, no unease. Her gaze seemed to pierce through pretense, and the five specialists found themselves lowering their heads, swallowing their prepared speeches.

Fiona clicked her tongue in admiration. This girl was formidable—a single look had silenced seasoned experts.

"Later, later! Food first!" Fiona linked arms with Luna. "Everything else can wait until we've eaten!"

The dining room fell silent as every occupant rose in unison. All eyes locked onto Luna.

"Dr. White, please sit here!" Helen Turner beckoned warmly, seating Luna between herself and Andrew Smith. She clasped Luna's hands, studying her with the fervor of someone examining a priceless artifact.

"Dr. White, we can't possibly thank you enough..."

Nathaniel observed the legendary healer with curiosity. He remained unaware how close he'd come to death—or that his savior would be this unassuming young woman.

Andrew smoothly intervened: "Aunt Helen, let's eat first."

"Right, right!" The Turner sisters raised their glasses in unison. "Our family toasts Dr. White—to our lifesaver!"

Luna hesitated at the shot glass of liquor before her. Still recovering her strength, alcohol was ill-advised.

A large, well-defined hand suddenly replaced her glass with a teacup.

"She can't drink." Andrew downed the liquor in one practiced motion. "I'll toast on her behalf."

Grace teased, "Andrew, you've been holding out on us! When are you bringing your fiancée home to meet the family?"

"Just finalizing the marriage paperwork." Andrew's expression didn't flicker. "We planned to announce after everything was settled."

Luna's pulse jumped. Marriage paperwork? He was serious?

Richard Adams couldn't stay seated. He stood with his glass, shamefaced. "Dr. White, I owe you an apology for my earlier behavior. This one's on me—please be magnanimous..."

He drained his glass, stomach churning. Offending a miracle worker like this—what if his elderly parents fell ill later?

The thought filled him with bitter regret.
###Chapter 77: A Safety Net

"As long as you follow the prescribed regimen, there won’t be any serious issues," Luna White reassured softly. She noticed the skepticism in Richard Adams' eyes—he probably suspected she was withholding the prescription to manipulate the Turner family.

But she had no such intentions. Helping the Turners was simply about securing a safety net for her sister and brother-in-law. Her sister’s temporary job depended entirely on Factory Manager Victor Green’s whims, and her brother-in-law’s work was unstable. With three children to feed and educate, she knew exactly how hard life was for them. If she could ease their burden, she would.

In her past life, her sister’s family had bankrupted themselves for her sake, and her brother-in-law had never once complained. That kind of devotion wasn’t something she could ever forget. This time around, she would protect them.

"Are you sure he’s really fine?" Helen Turner still seemed uneasy.

Nathaniel Smith studied Luna with open curiosity. "You’re the one who saved me? I didn’t expect someone so young. Who taught you medicine?"

Luna had prepared for this. "My parents were rural physicians—they knew herbal remedies and acupuncture. The technique I used is a family secret, but it’s harsh. It drains the user’s vitality with each use, so I avoid it unless absolutely necessary. Today, I only did it because my uncle insisted..." She deliberately glanced at David Moore.

David flushed with guilt. They’d acted out of selfishness, nearly harming this girl, yet now the credit was being handed to him.

"It was also General Turner’s good fortune that Luna happened to be visiting her sister," David quickly interjected.

Helen and General Charles Turner exchanged a look, understanding Luna’s unspoken message—she didn’t want this getting out. And why would she? Such a taxing technique would only harm her with repeated use.

The meal passed pleasantly. Afterward, Luna politely declined Factory Manager Green’s invitation to stay and excused herself with David. Andrew Smith offered to walk her home.

On the way, Luna turned to him sincerely. "Thank you for today."

Andrew raised an eyebrow. "For what? I’m your fiancé—protecting you is expected. Besides, was saving a life wrong? The village security chief couldn’t stop praising your skills when he saw me. Said I’d found a treasure."

Luna burst into laughter, her dimples flashing under the sunlight, bright and dazzling.

Andrew stared, momentarily stunned. It was the first time he’d seen her laugh so freely—like warm spring sunshine. Silently, he vowed to keep that smile on her face forever.

"You’re exaggerating," Luna said, still smiling. "If I ever did something bad, Instructor Smith would be the first to arrest me."

"You?" Andrew actually smirked. "You wouldn’t even fight back when bullied. What trouble could you possibly cause?"

Luna glared. "Instructor Smith, don’t hit where it hurts!"

"My mistake," Andrew said solemnly. "Even if it’s true, I shouldn’t have said it."

Luna laughed despite herself. "What are you even doing here? Weren’t you supposed to be on training exercises?"
###Chapter 78: The Enthusiastic Sister

"Uncle Wang and my father were old comrades-in-arms. Nathaniel and I grew up together—that kid used to follow me around all the time, calling me 'Brother Andrew,'" Andrew Smith explained with a smile. "When I heard he was sick, I happened to be on a mission nearby and came to check on him. I didn’t expect to run into you. If I hadn’t arrived in time, they would’ve kicked you out."

He found it strange himself. He had only met Luna White a handful of times, and each time, she was at her most vulnerable. Normally, he despised weak, easily bullied girls. He had a strong personality and couldn’t stand people who passively accepted mistreatment.

Yet, for some reason, he couldn’t let Luna go. Those tear-filled eyes of hers always managed to pierce the softest part of his heart. Stranger still, he felt an inexplicable trust in her—enough to vouch for her in front of Uncle Wang. If Luna failed to cure Nathaniel, he’d be in deep trouble.

"What about you? Why are you in town?" He remembered she should have been at home preparing for university.

Luna pointed ahead. "I came to visit my second sister. She married into town."

Iris White was hurrying toward them. As soon as David Moore got home, he had recounted everything about Luna’s encounter at Factory Manager Victor Green’s house, leaving Iris and Aunt Martha Cooper horrified. What shocked her even more was that her little sister had suddenly gained a soldier fiancé!

From a distance, she spotted a tall, straight-backed figure in a military uniform—his short, neat hair and commanding presence unmistakably that of an officer. Up close, she realized just how handsome he was, speaking gently to Luna.

"Luna, who is this...?" Iris nervously rubbed her hands together.

"Hello, Sister Iris. I’m Andrew Smith," he said before Luna could respond, extending his hand. "Luna’s fiancé. I’m an instructor at the military academy. I was passing through and wanted to meet you."

Iris hastily wiped her hands on her clothes before shaking his. "Oh, hello! Please, come inside." As she led the way, she couldn’t help adding, "Our Luna is a good girl. You must treat her well."

Luna covered her face, wishing she could disappear into the ground.

Andrew, however, saluted solemnly. "You have my word, Sister Iris. As a soldier, I swear on my honor to take care of Luna. I’ll cover all her university expenses—"

"No, no!" Iris waved her hands frantically. "We may be poor, but we won’t let our sister rely on her fiancé’s money."

Luna smiled. "I can handle the tuition myself."

Iris tugged Andrew toward their small courtyard. Henry Cooper, flustered by the imposing officer, scrambled to find a bowl of sugared water as a gesture of hospitality. William Cooper, however, hid in his room, too intimidated to show his face.

"Henry, go get two pounds of meat! We’ll make dumplings for dinner!" Iris bustled about.

Andrew quickly stopped Henry. "Brother-in-law, don’t trouble yourself. I have to catch the last bus back, or I’ll face disciplinary action." He deliberately put on a pained expression. "The food at our mess hall is barely edible. I’d kill for a home-cooked meal. Next time I’m on leave, I’ll come try your cooking."

Henry wrung his hands. "But this won’t do! Your first visit, and we can’t even feed you..."

Luna stepped in. "Sis, military rules are strict. If he’s late, he’ll be confined to quarters."

Iris’s expression changed instantly. "Then you must go! Henry, take him to the station on your bike!"

In the end, Andrew politely declined Henry’s offer and left in a hurry. Before he went, he gave Luna one last lingering look—one that made her heart skip a beat.
###Chapter 79: Luna's Calculations

Iris White watched Andrew Smith's retreating figure and sighed softly. "Luna, you're a lucky girl. Instructor Andrew seems like a decent man—he won't let you down." She took Luna's hand and spoke earnestly, "Listen, if you ever need money for school, just tell me. Your brother and I will manage, no matter how tight things get. But remember this—never accept money from Andrew. A woman must never owe a man favors, or you'll lose respect in his family."

Luna's eyes grew warm. Her sister always put her first.

"Don't worry, Iris," she said, squeezing Iris's calloused hand. "The university provides grants, and I can work part-time. You shouldn't skimp on food—the kids need proper meals." She flashed a bright smile. "Our best days are still ahead."

"Yes, the best days are coming!" Iris nodded repeatedly.

Nearby, William Cooper lowered his head silently, lost in thought.

At dinner, Iris served steaming porridge, fresh steamed buns, and a pot of stew—a rare feast for their household, where pickles with porridge was the usual fare.

Luna felt a pang of guilt. She hadn't meant to burden her sister. This visit had resolved Iris's worries and cured her brother-in-law's ailment, repaying their years of kindness. She planned to leave tomorrow—but not before settling one final matter. Frank Harris's free ride was about to end.

Memories of Frank's past cruelty flickered in Luna's eyes. She couldn't take his life in this lawful society, but she wouldn't let him roam free either. Frank relied entirely on his childless uncle's support. Cut off that lifeline, and...

Footsteps interrupted her thoughts. Richard Adams and Factory Manager Victor Green arrived with their wives, arms laden with gifts—milk powder, malted drinks, canned food, chocolates—piling the table high. Before leaving, they pressed a thick envelope into her hands.

Despite her protests, Luna had to accept. Richard's demeanor had shifted markedly since morning—after verifying her medical skills with Andrew and hearing of David Moore's recovery, they now regarded her as a hidden master.

Victor, ever shrewd, promoted Iris to workshop supervisor the next day, bypassing protocol. His wife Fiona began visiting Iris constantly, acting like sisters. Workers whispered about Iris's sudden connection to the factory elite.

Only Victor knew the truth: befriending Iris meant securing access to Luna—a lifeline for future ailments.
###Chapter 80: The Weight of Gratitude

The misfortunes of Iris White's family were set aside for now. The next morning, Luna White packed her belongings to return home. Before leaving, Iris stuffed her bag with food and secretly slipped in ten dollars for travel expenses.

"Sis, I can't take this," Luna said, her eyes stinging as she touched the still-warm bills.

"Take it!" Iris insisted, pressing her hand firmly over Luna's. "Your brother-in-law just got paid. We have enough."

Luna bit her lip and nodded before turning away quickly. She didn’t dare look back, afraid to see the tears in her sister’s eyes. Only when she was far down the road did her own tears finally spill over.

Iris stood at the door, watching her younger sister disappear into the distance. She wiped her eyes. "Luna's grown up," she murmured.

Henry Cooper gently wrapped an arm around his wife’s shoulders. "Don’t worry. She’s a sensible girl."

Back inside, Iris began tidying up. She had an afternoon shift to work and needed to hurry. Since William had recovered, their financial burden had lessened, and life finally held some promise.

As she pulled back the covers, she suddenly noticed an envelope tucked beneath the pillow. Inside, thirty crisp ten-dollar bills were neatly stacked, along with a note:

"Dear Iris, I’m leaving you 300 of the 1,000 dollars Factory Manager Green gave me. Tomorrow, I’ll give Maya the same. The rest I’ll take to school. You don’t need to send me any more money. We’re sisters—no thanks needed. —Luna"

Iris burst into tears. Henry rushed over, alarmed at the sight of his wife sobbing uncontrollably.

"Luna… Luna, she—" Iris choked on her words.

Henry’s expression darkened when he saw the money. "I’ll ride after her right now! We can’t accept this!"

"Don’t," Iris stopped him. "If she left it secretly, she meant for us to keep it."

Henry paced anxiously. "But she’s just a student! She’ll need every penny!"

Just then, William emerged from the inner room. His health had improved, his complexion now rosy with vitality.

"Brother, Iris is right," William said softly. "Luna sees us as family. If you force it back, you’ll only hurt her feelings."

Henry’s eyes widened in disbelief. "What kind of nonsense is that?" His voice shook with anger. "After everything Luna’s done for us, how can we take her money when she needs it?"

Iris quickly intervened. "Just hear him out!"

William calmly pulled up a stool and sat before his brother. "What I mean is, we keep it for now. If Luna ever faces an emergency at school, we’ll give it back to help her. Isn’t that better than forcing it on her now?"

Henry froze, his anger fading. He studied his younger brother for a long moment before suddenly ruffling William’s hair. "Since when did you learn to outsmart me, you little rascal?"

Iris burst into laughter, and the heavy atmosphere in the room lightened instantly.

Henry sighed, carefully rewrapping the money. "Fine. We’ll do as William says. But this goes straight to the bank—not a single dollar gets spent."

"Understood!" Iris teased, poking his forehead. "Always the worrier."

Sunlight streamed through the window, bathing the family of three in warmth. Iris suddenly realized—this must be what happiness looked like.
###Chapter 81: Repaying Kindness

"Brother, sister-in-law, there's something I've been wanting to say for days," William Cooper rubbed his hands nervously, his voice trembling. "I was afraid you wouldn't agree... but leaving without telling you would be ungrateful after all your care."

Henry and Iris Cooper exchanged glances, their hearts sinking. This sounded like he was planning to run away from home.

"Where are you going?" Iris grabbed William's arm. She'd watched her brother-in-law grow up since marrying into the Cooper family, treating him like her own younger brother. The thought of him leaving now made her frantic.

"Isn't life good here?" Iris stomped her foot anxiously. "What can an uneducated man like you do out there? Can you handle hard labor? Do you even know how to write for office work?" Her voice grew more urgent. "Even my temporary job was secured through multiple connections!"

Henry quickly added, "You've just recovered—why push yourself? We have enough food for everyone."

William gently freed his arm and guided Iris to sit down. Taking a deep breath, he met their gazes firmly. "Brother, sister-in-law, I've thought this through. There aren't many job opportunities here—an extra mouth is just another burden."

"Most importantly..." His voice cracked slightly. "Luna saved my life. I can't just accept that grace without doing anything. She's about to start school in the city, and everything costs money. That instructor Andrew comes from a wealthy family—we can't let Luna rely on his money and lose dignity in her future marriage."

Henry froze. Finally understanding his brother's intentions, he smacked his own forehead hard. "I'm such an idiot! I actually misunderstood you..."

"Brother!" William grabbed Henry's arm. "How could you know what I was thinking? We're family—no need for explanations!"

Henry's eyes grew moist as he clapped William's shoulder firmly. "Good man! I support you! A real man repays kindness!"

William immediately turned to Iris, shaking her arm playfully like he did as a child. "Sister-in-law~ Big brother agreed! Say yes too!"

Iris, dizzy from his antics, finally laughed helplessly. "Fine, fine, I'll agree!" Then her expression turned serious. "But on three conditions!"

William sat up straight.

"First, no dangerous jobs! Second, eat on time! Third..." Her voice wavered. "If things don't work out, come home. I'll always leave the door open for you."

Tears spilled down William's cheeks. He nodded solemnly, like a soldier making a vow before deployment. "I promise, sister-in-law."

Outside, the setting sun stretched their three shadows long across the ground.
###Chapter 82: Repaying Kindness

Luna White hurried to the bus station to check the return schedule. With an hour left before departure, she wandered into the town's bustling marketplace. By 1985, economic policies had loosened, and shops lined the streets, bustling with merchants and customers. The days when "profiteering" was a dirty word were long gone.

Frank Harris's uncle, Frank Harris Sr., was one of those merchants. Oddly enough, despite being shrewd in business, he was completely under his nephew's thumb. Over the years, every penny he earned had been funneled into Frank Jr.'s bottomless pit—building a tiled house, arranging a marriage—whatever the younger man demanded, the elder never refused.

Frank Sr.'s shop had once thrived, and his three daughters had married well, leaving the family comfortable. But after Frank Jr. developed a gambling addiction, the household was drained dry. Eventually, they even sold their townhouse and retreated to the village in disgrace. With no money left, Frank Jr. grew worse, often beating his uncle in fits of rage.

If not for Frank Sr.'s eldest son-in-law—a man with some influence in town—who intervened and took the elderly couple away, they might not have survived. After a brutal warning from the son-in-law, Frank Jr. finally backed off. Now, the old couple had returned to town and opened a small general store.

Luna strolled toward the shop just as Aunt May was tossing a basin of water outside. Quick on her feet, Luna darted forward—only to get drenched from the knees down.

"Ah!" she yelped, staring at her soaked pants and cloth shoes in dismay.

Aunt May dropped the basin in shock and rushed out. "Oh dear, I'm so sorry, girl! Didn't see you there!"

Luna squeezed the wet fabric, leaving damp footprints with each step.

"Auntie, I—" She hesitated.

Aunt May grabbed her arm. "Come inside! I'll find you a dry pair of pants." Without waiting for a reply, she pulled Luna in and called over her shoulder, "Old man, watch the shop! I'm helping this girl change!"

Frank Sr. hurried out, apologizing profusely. "Sit down, girl. I'll get you some hot water."

Luna shook her head politely. "It's fine. I wasn’t paying attention."

Aunt May rummaged through a chest and pulled out a pair of black pants. They were too loose, so Luna had to cinch them tightly with a red belt. Aunt May hung the wet pants in front of an electric fan and brought out a tin of pumpkin seeds and fruit candies.

"Visiting family?" Frank Sr. handed her a cup of hot water.

Luna sighed. "Came to see my sister."

"Too young to be sighing like that," Aunt May scolded lightly, pressing a handful of seeds into her palm. "Tell me what's wrong."

Luna lowered her eyes. "My sister had two daughters, and her in-laws treat her like dirt. I couldn’t stay there anymore..."

Aunt May’s eyes welled up. She knew the pain of not bearing sons all too well. Clapping her thigh, she exclaimed, "What a sin! Don’t you worry, child. Tell me everything."

Luna peeked up at Aunt May’s kind expression, warmth blooming in her chest. In her past life, when Frank Jr. had beaten her black and blue, Aunt May had been the only one to sneak her medicine. And when she’d escaped after being sold to a debtor, it was Aunt May who slipped her ten dollars to survive.

This lifetime, she would repay that kindness.
###Chapter 83: Lessons Written in Blood

Luna White pressed her lips together, remaining silent. Maya White understood—these days, every family hid their shame, swallowing their bitterness like broken teeth, terrified of becoming the town’s laughingstock.

"Ah, if you don’t want to talk, don’t." Maya sighed. "Every family has its troubles. Take me—I’ve suffered just like your sister. Three daughters, and my mother-in-law acted like I’d doomed their precious Harris bloodline. Look at your uncle—obsessed with that nephew of his, treating Frank Harris like his own son. And what kind of man is Frank? Nothing but trouble! Just wait—you’ll see!" She shot her husband, Jack Harris, a venomous glare.

Jack’s face darkened. Why did his wife have to air their dirty laundry in front of a girl?

"Enough!" he snapped.

"Enough?" Maya’s voice rose. "You’d hand everything we own to Frank, wouldn’t you? Your mother never lets us forget we have no son—every scrap of good fortune goes to him. We paid for that house, and what does Frank do? Lazes around, useless even to his own parents! You think he’ll take care of us when we’re old? Dream on!" Her chest heaved with fury.

Jack’s face burned. Humiliated in front of an outsider, his temper flared.

"Will you shut up? You think it’s my fault we have no son? If we had one, would I be begging my mother for money? Who’ll care for us when we’re old? Just rot away? Who’ll carry on the family name? We’ll die with no one to mourn us!"

The words stabbed Maya like knives. Tears spilled down her cheeks as she collapsed beside Luna, sobbing uncontrollably. The absence of a son was her deepest wound, and anyone could rub salt in it.

Luna took Maya’s calloused hand, the rough patches of hard labor scraping against her palm. These two had suffered so much—all because of a son’s worth over daughters. And where had it left them?

"Auntie, don’t cry." Luna patted Maya’s hand gently before turning to Jack. "Uncle, I don’t like what you’re saying. Since we’re on the subject, let me tell you about my sister’s family."

"My sister had two daughters—bright, well-behaved girls. But because they weren’t sons, her mother-in-law forced them to adopt a nephew. That boy demanded meat and new clothes the moment he stepped in, turning the house upside down. My sister’s family wasn’t rich—how could they afford it? Then he pointed at her and screamed that daughters were worthless, that everything belonged to him. Said if they didn’t spoil him, he’d let them starve when they got old, leave them to die alone!"

Jack stiffened. Why did that sound so familiar?

"Can you believe that? A child saying such things—who taught him? My sister sent him back, saying she couldn’t afford to keep him. Her mother-in-law flew into a rage, beat her bloody, called her a barren hen, and forced a divorce. And her sister-in-law sneered, saying sons were the only rightful heirs..."

Luna’s voice cracked. "In the end, my sister divorced. Her husband fell ill, and no one even brought him water. His sister stole their home. My sister and her girls live in a shack now. The children scavenge for coal and scraps after school..."

Jack’s blood ran cold. Wasn’t this their future? Hadn’t Frank said the same things? If he were bedridden one day...

Maya wiped her tears and clapped. "Your sister did right! Let the heartless suffer! Favor outsiders over your own flesh and blood? What nonsense!"

Suddenly, it all made sense. Better to divorce and split their assets than let Frank bleed them dry. At least then, their daughters would have something.
###Chapter 84: The Test

"You can't seriously believe that!" Frank Harris rubbed his hands together, forcing an ingratiating smile. "Everyone has a conscience. We've treated him so well—surely he wouldn’t turn out to be an ungrateful wretch?" He clung to a sliver of hope.

Martha Cooper stomped her foot in frustration.

"Frank Harris, you’re unbelievable!" Her eyes reddened. "Fine! Go live with your precious nephew then! I’m divorcing you—at least I won’t die alone with no one to care for me." The story Luna White had shared earlier churned in her mind like a storm.

Frank panicked. "Woman, what nonsense is this about divorce?" Though his mother had nagged him for years about not having a son, he’d never once considered leaving his wife. He was just weak-willed, still shackled by the outdated belief that sons mattered more than daughters.

Martha wiped her tears and turned to Luna. "Dear, your sister was a wise woman. She knew there was no future with that kind of family and was willing to risk everything for her daughter. And your brother-in-law—he understood who truly cared for him. But me..." Her voice cracked.

Luna handed her the towel Martha had given her earlier to dry her hands.

Seeing his wife in such distress twisted Frank’s heart. Over the years, she’d endured endless humiliation for not bearing a son. They’d poured all their money into supporting Frank, leaving their three daughters with barely any dowry when they married.

"Aunt Martha, Uncle Frank," Luna said gently, "divorce isn’t the answer. Uncle Frank has a good heart. Don’t let anger make this decision for you."

Martha glared at Frank, her eyes still red. "I’m giving you an ultimatum—either cut Frank off completely, not a single penny to him, or we divorce. I’d rather live in peace alone!"

Frank wrung his hands anxiously.

Luna suddenly smiled. "Actually, there’s an easy way to settle this. Why don’t we test Frank?"

"How?" the couple asked in unison.

"Like this..." Luna leaned in and lowered her voice, outlining her plan.

Martha’s eyes lit up. "Brilliant!"

Frank nodded eagerly. Who wouldn’t want to know if their nephew’s affection was genuine or just an act?

"Then it’s settled," Luna said, clapping her hands. "Once we have the results, you’ll know what to do."

Martha grabbed Luna’s hands, her voice trembling with gratitude. "You’ve been such a blessing to us!"

Before Luna left, Martha insisted on stuffing her bag with jars of preserves and pastries. Frank even rode his vintage bicycle to escort her to the bus stop, urging her to visit again soon.

With the heavy bundle in her arms, Luna waved goodbye and boarded the bus. The sunlight streaming through the window warmed her heart.
###Chapter 85: Public Humiliation

Mayor George Clark and his wife Clara arrived in the city with their daughter Lily at dawn. Lily had been vomiting the entire journey, her face as pale as parchment. Clara wept silently, her heart breaking for her daughter, while George chain-smoked, the ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts.

"George, do you think that Harold boy will take responsibility?" Clara asked anxiously.

George crushed his cigarette with a snarl. "He'd better."

The Martin family had a terrible reputation in their village, especially Harold's mother—a notorious gossip and penny-pincher. The thought of marrying Lily into such a family made Clara feel as though a knife were twisting in her chest.

At the factory gates, the security guard eyed them suspiciously. "Looking for Harold Martin? What's your relation?"

"Family," George replied with a forced chuckle.

Inside the factory, Harold was flirting with a female worker, Miss Cui. Ever since he'd started seeing city girls, he'd found Lily embarrassingly provincial. But what did it matter? The deed was done—that country girl wasn't going anywhere.

"Harold Martin, you have visitors at the gate!" the loudspeaker blared.

Harold sauntered over, only to freeze when he recognized the three figures waiting for him—the mayor, his wife, and Lily, all glaring at him with murderous intensity. Clara's eyes burned with fury, as if she wanted to skin him alive.

"Uncle, Auntie, what brings you here?" he asked, feigning calm.

Lily rushed forward, tears streaming as she clutched his sleeve. Clara trembled with rage. "Lily! Get back here!"

"Mom..." Lily whimpered but stayed rooted in place.

SMACK! Clara slapped her daughter's back. "You disgraceful girl!"

George's voice was low and dangerous. "Let's talk somewhere private."

They moved to the basketball court. George cut straight to the point. "Harold, what are your intentions with Lily?"

Harold's eyes darted shiftily. "Uncle, what do you mean? There's nothing between us."

CRACK! A sharp slap sent his head snapping to the side. Clara exploded. "You lying bastard! My daughter is carrying your child, and you dare play dumb? Should I march straight to the factory director's office?"

Harold clutched his stinging cheek, stunned. Lily's pregnant? This was bad. His gaze flicked nervously toward the workshop, praying Miss Cui hadn't seen anything.
###Chapter 86: The Scheme

"You... you're pregnant?" Harold Martin stammered, his finger trembling as he pointed at Lily Clark.

His mind raced. Just that one time and she got pregnant? After that first encounter, Lily had refused to let him touch her again, leaving him frustrated and resentful. He had even started considering marrying Xiao Zhen from the factory instead—until Lily showed up with this bombshell.

"Yes, it's been over two months. Almost three," Lily said, her eyes filled with despair. She wasn’t stupid—she could hear the reluctance in Harold’s voice. He was trying to weasel out of responsibility.

"How is that possible? It was just that one time—" Harold snapped his mouth shut. He had just admitted to their relationship.

George Clark, Lily’s father, spoke slowly, a smile still on his face. "Harold, what do you plan to do about this? Will you propose properly and marry her soon? Or should we take this matter to your factory manager? Time is running out—Lily’s condition won’t stay hidden forever."

His tone was mild, but every word carried a sharp edge. "My daughter isn’t desperate for a husband, but she won’t be disrespected either. Whoever makes my daughter suffer will regret it. Harold, you’re the first fool bold enough to spit in my face like this."

A cold sweat broke out on Harold’s back. Lily might have been easy to manipulate, but George was a different story. The man didn’t even need to curse to make a threat.

"Uncle, I was wrong. I’ll go home and tell my parents right away. We’ll come to propose soon—I won’t let Lily suffer," Harold said quickly, backing down. Now wasn’t the time to fight. He needed to get them out of here first and figure out a plan later.

At his words, color finally returned to Lily’s face.

But Clara Clark, Lily’s mother, only felt disgust as she looked at Harold. This was the man who would marry her daughter? Yet with Lily’s pregnancy, she had no choice but to swallow her anger.

"Fine. We’ll wait for your parents," George said, standing up. There was no point arguing now—the priority was dealing with Lily’s pregnancy. An unwed mother would be ruined in their society.

Once the three of them left, Harold let out a long breath.

This was bad. A month ago, he might have gone through with marrying Lily. But now, he was already involved with Xiao Zhen—they had even rented a place together in secret. Xiao Zhen was bold and exciting, far more interesting than Lily. He had already decided to marry her.

Just yesterday, Xiao Zhen had complained about feeling nauseous, hinting she might be pregnant. He had promised her they’d marry if she was. Now, he was stuck between two impossible choices.

George wasn’t someone to cross, but Xiao Zhen wasn’t someone he could afford to anger either. Her uncle was the workshop supervisor, and their families had already met. If either side turned against him, he was finished.

Harold was finally tasting the bitter consequences of playing both sides.

Back at the factory, he asked for leave. Xiao Zhen chased after him. "What’s wrong? I heard your family came to see you?"

"My mother’s sick. I need to go check on her," Harold lied.

"Then I’ll come with you!" Xiao Zhen insisted.

"No, no! When she’s better, I’ll bring my parents to propose. You’ll meet them soon enough!" he said, placating her.

He already had a plan. If he could make George call off the engagement, he’d be in the clear. Then he could avoid offending either side—maybe even marry Lily first and divorce her later. With his silver tongue, he was sure he could keep Xiao Zhen on the hook.

"Who said I’d marry you?" Xiao Zhen blushed and ran off.

Harold rushed home, arriving just as dusk fell.

"Why are you back again?" his mother asked, puzzled.

"Mom, it’s an emergency!" Harold grabbed her and spilled everything.

"You reckless fool!" His mother slapped him hard. "Are you trying to kill me? Do you know who George Clark is?"

She was tough, but even she knew this was a disaster.
###Chapter 87: Contempt

"Mom, stop hitting me! Even if you beat me to death, we still have to deal with this!" Harold Martin dodged with a cheeky grin, knowing his mother wouldn’t really hurt him. As the only son in the family, doted on by his three older sisters and without any younger brothers to compete for attention, he was the apple of his mother’s eye.

Mrs. Martin stomped her foot in frustration. "You wretched boy! This time you’ve really gone too far!"

Harold grabbed his mother’s arm and dragged her inside, catching sight of his father squatting by the door smoking a pipe. He pulled him up too. "Dad, come on in. We need to talk this through."

The three of them huddled behind closed doors all night. The next day, Harold returned to work whistling as if nothing had happened. After his shift, he went back to his usual routine, arm in arm with his girlfriend, living without a care in the world.

Meanwhile, Clara Clark paced anxiously at home. "It’s been two days, and the Martins still haven’t made a move. I should go ask them!"

"Stop right there!" Mayor George Clark grabbed his wife’s arm. "Our daughter is carrying his child, and he’s not even in a hurry. If you go running after them, you’ll only humiliate yourself."

Lily Clark hid in her room, too ashamed to face anyone. Morning sickness had left her weak and gaunt. Clara’s heart ached as she wiped away tears, trying everything to cook nourishing meals for her daughter, but the pain in her chest was unbearable.

"It’s all my fault. I didn’t protect her..." Clara murmured through her tears. "That Harold was never any good—slick and untrustworthy. How will Lily survive this?"

She kept these thoughts to herself. She couldn’t tell her daughter not to marry him, yet she feared Lily would suffer if she did. Sleep eluded her night after night.

On the third day, the Martins finally showed up.

Clara’s face darkened the moment she opened the door—who came empty-handed for a marriage proposal? George, however, remained composed, inviting them in and asking his wife to serve tea.

Thud! Clara slammed down two bowls of plain water—not a single tea leaf in sight.

A smug glint flashed in Mrs. Martin’s eyes as she dusted off her clothes with a handkerchief. "Mayor Clark, our disgraceful son has brought shame upon us all. But time is of the essence—Lily’s condition..."

Splash! Before she could finish, a bowl of cold water hit her face.

"Get out!" Lily stood trembling in the doorway, her voice shaking with rage. "I’d rather abort this child than step foot in your house!"

Mrs. Martin wiped her face and sneered. "Oh, such a temper. Who else would want you in this state besides our Harold?"

"You—!" Lily’s face burned with humiliation as tears spilled over.

Mrs. Martin turned to George. "Mayor Clark, you see how it is. It’s not that we’re being unreasonable—your daughter looks down on us. If she wants to marry, it’ll be on our terms: no dowry, no wedding feast. Otherwise..." She cast a meaningful glance at Lily’s belly. "She can figure it out herself."

With that, she turned on her heel and left.
###Chapter 88: Breaking Point

"Stop right there!" Mayor George Clark slammed his hand on the table, veins bulging at his temples.

Mrs. Martin had intended to drop her ultimatum and leave, letting the Clarks stew over it. She hadn’t expected the mayor to explode on the spot.

Thinking of her son’s future, she steeled herself and turned with a cold smirk. "What now, Mayor Clark? Have you finally agreed to our terms?" Her words were like pouring oil on fire.

"Harold’s mother, are you deliberately sabotaging this marriage?" George couldn’t tolerate his daughter being insulted like this. If they dared to humiliate her to her face, who knew how they’d mistreat her after marriage?

In that instant, he resolved to call off the engagement—but not without making Harold Martin pay for his audacity.

Mrs. Martin flicked her handkerchief dismissively. "Oh, Mayor Clark, such accusations! We came in good faith, but your family’s the one playing hard to get. If word gets out, it’s your reputation that’ll suffer." She shot Lily a disdainful glance. "A girl like her, acting all high and mighty? In the old days, she’d have been punished for her shame!"

She knew full well that if things came to blows, the Clarks would lose. Harold had another girl at the factory—one whose uncle was a high-ranking official. Compared to Lily, that match was like heaven and earth.

"Get out! I’d sooner marry a stray dog than Harold Martin!" Lily sobbed, lunging forward. "A family like yours deserves to rot without heirs!"

Mrs. Martin’s face darkened. "Lily Clark, don’t you dare be ungrateful! Marrying into our family would be an honor!"

George pulled his daughter behind him, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Fine! Then remember this: if Harold Martin ever sets foot in this village again, I’ll make sure he regrets it!"

"Mayor Clark, this is a new era!" Mrs. Martin forced a defiant tone. "If this escalates, let’s see whose daughter loses face first!"

"Ha! I got Harold that factory job—I can just as easily send him back to the fields," George sneered. "Test me if you dare."

The Martins slunk away in defeat. The moment the gate shut, Lily collapsed into her mother’s arms, wailing.

"Enough!" George kicked over a stool. "You should’ve thought of this sooner!"

Lily fled into the house and buried her face in the bedding. Outside, George and Clara sat on the doorstep in heavy silence.

The night wind swirled with dead leaves, mirroring the turmoil in their hearts.
###Chapter 89: Missing

"George! Are we just going to let this go? That bastard Harold Martin gets to walk free?" Clara Clark clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. She loathed the Martin family for ruining her daughter’s life. What decent man would want to marry Lily now?

Mayor George Clark sat in silence, chain-smoking, the ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts.

Clara’s muffled sobs cut through him like a knife. He had never felt so powerless. His wife couldn’t even cry openly, afraid of being overheard. If this scandal spread, not only would their family be shamed, but the entire Clark and Jackson clans would become the talk of the village.

"Say something! Are we just going to let our daughter suffer like this?" Clara wished she could stab Harold Martin herself.

George glanced at Lily’s closed bedroom door and lowered his voice. "First, we’ll take her to get rid of the baby. Harold won’t get away with this. As long as the Martins stay in this village, I’ll make them kneel and beg for forgiveness."

At his words, Clara’s tears fell harder.

But that very night, Lily vanished. Clara remembered Luna’s warning and panicked. If that foolish girl had gone to one of those back-alley clinics, she’d be risking her life.

George rallied relatives and friends to search for her. When Luna White returned to the village, she ran into Clara and her sister, Elizabeth, trudging back in defeat. After a full day and night of searching, there was no sign of Lily.

"Aunt Clara, what’s wrong?" Luna was shocked. In just a few days, Clara had aged a decade—deep wrinkles framed her eyes, and her hair had turned half-gray.

The moment Clara saw Luna, tears streamed down her face. She grabbed Luna’s hands desperately. "Luna, Lily’s gone! How am I supposed to go on like this?"

Elizabeth Jackson gritted her teeth beside them. "If anything happens to Lily, I swear I’ll tear the Martin house apart! Harold thinks he can become a factory worker? In his dreams!"

Luna’s heart sank. Lily had taken the same path as before—despite her warning.

"Don’t panic, Aunt Clara. Do you have any idea where Lily might have gone?"

Clara shook her head, her vision blurring as she nearly collapsed. Luna caught her just in time. The days of anguish had finally broken her.

"Yesterday, the Martins came to force Lily into marriage. After the argument, she disappeared... Luna, I’m afraid she might do something reckless..." Clara’s legs gave way.

Luna and Elizabeth quickly helped her home. The moment Clara lay down, she spiked a fever, murmuring Lily’s name in delirium.

When George rushed back and saw his wife in such a state, even the tough man’s eyes reddened as he crouched in the yard.

Luna’s chest tightened. In her past life, Lily had met her fate tonight. If she remembered correctly, Lily had gone to the illegal clinic in Shilipu—the one by the crooked tree the villagers said was cursed.

"Uncle George!" Luna pulled him up urgently. "On my way back, someone said they saw Lily heading toward Shilipu! Take the tractor and go now!"

George didn’t hesitate. He called for Paul Jackson, and within minutes, the tractor rumbled toward Shilipu with half a dozen men.

The night was pitch-black, the tractor’s headlights slicing through the darkness. Luna clung to the railing, praying silently: Please, let us make it in time.
###Chapter 90: Unexpected Encounter

The tractor chugged along the country road before sputtering to a halt with a dull thud.

"What happened?" Mayor George Clark lurched forward, nearly tumbling from his seat.

David Moore smacked the steering wheel in frustration. "We're out of gas, Mayor. Used it all up hauling grain today. I meant to refill tomorrow—"

"You—!" George clenched his fists, stomping his foot in anger.

Without hesitation, Luna White hopped down from the vehicle. "Arguing won't help. We're halfway there—let's walk." She knew helping George was crucial. That wretched grandmother would return to the village eventually, and they'd need the mayor's support to stand up to her.

In the village, the mayor's word was law—land distribution, housing permits, relief grain allocation. Even the domineering White family wouldn't dare openly defy him.

Luna refused to repeat past mistakes. In her previous life, her siblings had suffered under their grandmother's cruelty. This time, she needed an ally. Saving Lily would ensure George's protection for her and her siblings.

The group trudged forward in the dark, flashlights cutting through the pitch-black night as the wind howled around them.

"Stop right there! Who goes there?" Shadowy figures suddenly blocked their path.

Luna's heart raced. Highway robbery? The crackdown on crime had just ended—who would dare?

"We're from Liupan Village!" George shone his flashlight, then exhaled in relief. "Andrew?"

Squinting, Luna recognized Andrew Smith's sharp features. Her stomach dropped. Why did she keep running into him?

"What are you doing out here so late—" Andrew began, but George quickly explained the situation.

"Get in!" Andrew ordered without hesitation, turning to his comrade. "Jack, drive!"

Luna found herself squeezed into the cab, the faint scent of soap clinging to Andrew's uniform.

"Coming along, Mrs. Smith?" Jack suddenly asked.

Luna's cheeks warmed. "Lily's a young woman. My presence might be... helpful."

Andrew glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "Her own mother isn't this concerned," he remarked stiffly.

"I want to help," she shot back.

The cab fell silent, the tension thick enough to hear breathing.

Ten minutes later, the truck screeched to a halt outside a house. A gnarled tree stood stark against the moonlight in the front yard.

Then—a bloodcurdling scream pierced the night before abruptly cutting off.

George paled. "That was Lily!"

Luna's heart leaped into her throat.
###Chapter 91: Race Against Death

George Clark's eyes burned with desperation as his fist pounded against the wooden door.

"Open up! Open this door right now!"

The lights inside flickered out abruptly.

George's heart clenched, his voice cracking. "Lily! It's your father! Answer me!"

A sharp shout came from the courtyard. "Stop yelling! There's no Lily here! Get lost before I call for help!"

George's punches grew more frantic, the door shuddering under his blows. "Let my daughter go! If anything happens to her, I swear I'll kill you!"

A woman's panicked cry cut through the chaos. "Husband! Come quick! The girl—she's dying!"

George's vision darkened, the image of his daughter lying in a pool of blood flashing before his eyes.

"Move!" Andrew Smith's command was sharp.

Luna White understood instantly. "Pull the mayor back!"

Just as several young men dragged George away, a deafening crash echoed through the night—Andrew had kicked the sturdy door clean off its hinges.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

That kick would have shattered bones if it had landed on a person...

Luna started forward, only to be yanked back by her collar.

"Stay behind me." Andrew pulled her protectively behind him without room for argument.

A man with bloodied hands burst out of the house. "What the hell are you doing? This is trespassing!"

Andrew's men immediately pinned him against the wall.

The metallic scent of blood filled the air.

Luna's stomach dropped—Lily hadn't escaped the fate of hemorrhaging after all.

George rushed into the inner room to find his daughter lying on the bed, the floral-patterned sheets beneath her soaked crimson.

"Lily!" George collapsed beside the bed, his voice trembling.

Lily's eyelids fluttered weakly, her pupils unfocused. "Dad... I'm sorry... Next life... I'll be a better daughter..."

Before she could finish, her body went limp.

"Lily! Wake up! I'm taking you to the hospital!" George moved to lift her, but Luna stopped him.

"Uncle, the hospital is three hours away. There's no time."

George spun around, knees buckling as if to kneel.

Luna caught him. "Uncle, I'll save her. Everyone needs to leave."

"Luna, she's my only daughter..." George clutched her hand, voice breaking.

A shout came from the corner. "Get her to a hospital now! Any longer and she'll die!"

Villagers poured in through the doorway, led by the mayor, who barked, "What's the meaning of barging in at this hour?"

The restrained man seized the opportunity. "Mayor! Call a doctor! She's bleeding out!"

The mayor paled. "Dr. Wu! Check her!"

A young bespectacled doctor was pushed forward. After a quick examination, he shook his head. "She's lost too much blood. She needs a major hospital—"

Before he could finish, George kicked him aside. "Get out!"

The villagers surged forward. "How dare you attack him?"

Luna gave George a firm nod before turning toward Lily.
###Chapter 92: Emergency Rescue

"Get out, all of you!" Mayor George Clark roared, his eyes bloodshot as he glared at the villagers crowding the room. "My daughter needs medical attention—no one stays!"

Paul Jackson and a few other strong young men immediately began ushering people out, shoving them toward the door. When someone tried to argue, Paul silenced them with a single sharp look.

Andrew Smith gave a subtle signal to his soldiers, and two of them seized the shady clinic doctor, dragging him toward the exit.

"You can't do this!" the doctor struggled desperately. "If she dies here, I won't take the blame!"

George lunged forward and slapped him hard, sending the man stumbling. "If anything happens to my daughter, I'll end you!"

"Uncle!" Andrew grabbed the enraged man by the arm. "Saving her comes first!"

The room fell silent. Luna White was already kneeling beside Lily Clark, fingers pressed to her wrist, her brow furrowed in concentration.

"Everyone out!" she snapped without looking up.

Outside in the yard, George crouched on the ground, his head in his hands. Paul tried to peer through the window, but Andrew shot him a warning glance.

"Boil water and prepare ginger tea with brown sugar," Andrew ordered a woman cowering in the corner. "And find clean blankets."

The woman hesitated, glancing at her husband—the doctor—for permission. Before the man could speak, George kicked him. "Move!"

The house was eerily quiet. The villagers of Shilipu exchanged uneasy glances, and someone muttered, "If this turns into a death..."

"Shut it!" Paul snarled. "Dr. White knows what she's doing!"

Suddenly, Luna's weak voice called from inside. "Uncle George... bring the blankets..."

George rushed in, Andrew close behind. They found Luna trembling violently, her lips tinged blue, yet she still clutched Lily's wrist.

"She's... stable..." she managed through chattering teeth.

Andrew swiftly handed her the ginger tea, supporting her as she drank. Then he turned to George. "Uncle, let’s get Lily to the truck."

Without hesitation, he scooped Luna up, blankets and all. The chill of her body sent a pang through his chest.

"Don't talk. We're going home," he murmured against her ear.

The truck sped down the country road. Andrew held Luna tightly, rubbing warmth back into her icy hands.

"Still cold?" His voice was uncharacteristically soft.

She shook her head, nestling deeper into his embrace. From the driver's seat, Jack Peterson caught the scene in the rearview mirror and nearly laughed.

Since when had their strict, no-nonsense instructor ever been this gentle?
###Chapter 93: Turning a Deaf Ear

Luna White returned to the village in surprisingly good condition. Her recovery was so swift that even Andrew Smith was secretly astonished. Compared to her last episode, this time she had regained her composure in mere moments.

Luna herself noticed something unusual. When Andrew held her, a warm current flowed into her body, dispelling the bone-chilling cold. The comfort was so immediate that she didn’t even shiver before returning to normal. She couldn’t help but glance at Andrew a few more times.

Was there something special about him that could counteract the side effects of her supernatural ability?

But neither of them had time to dwell on it now. Besides, it was a private matter—who would bother keeping it in mind?

Meanwhile, the Clark household was in chaos. When the military jeep brought Lily Clark back, she was carried inside on a stretcher. Clara Clark, who had been lying in bed with a high fever, sprang up the moment she heard her daughter had returned, showing no trace of illness.

Mayor George Clark had already instructed Paul Jackson and the others to stick to the story that Lily had fallen off a cliff and been rescued. This matter had to be kept secret, or Lily’s reputation would be ruined. The people from Shilipu would surely keep quiet too—after all, spreading such news would benefit no one.

Villagers who heard about the mayor’s daughter falling down the mountain came by to check on her. Seeing that she was fine, they went back home to sleep. It was the middle of the night, and since it wasn’t their own family’s business, their concern only went so far.

Once the crowd dispersed, Lily was carried into her room. Clara and Luna stayed by her bedside while the others waited in the main room. Now that she was back, everyone could finally relax.

"Luna, is she really alright?" Clara whispered, her eyes fixed on her daughter’s pale face. When she heard about Lily’s severe blood loss, she had nearly fainted. An unmarried girl suffering lasting damage—how could that be?

"Don’t worry, Auntie. Physically, she’s fine. She just needs to replenish her blood—eat more red dates and liver. The real issue is her mental state..." Before Luna could finish, Lily suddenly opened her eyes.

"Mom, why are you crying?" Lily murmured groggily.

Clara immediately grabbed her daughter’s hand. "Lily! You’re finally awake! Do you feel any discomfort? Let Luna check you—"

Then Lily remembered her foolish actions. Her gaze shifted to Luna standing beside her—the same Luna she had always looked down on, the meek and timid Luna.

"What are you doing here?" Lily snapped.

Luna couldn’t be bothered to argue. "Auntie, I’ll head back now. I’ll visit Lily another day." She had been exhausted all day, and tomorrow she planned to visit her eldest sister.

Clara wanted to see her out but couldn’t bear to leave her daughter. "George, Luna’s leaving—get her a flashlight!"

Andrew stood up. "Mayor, rest easy. I’ll walk Luna home—it’s on my way."

Everyone in the village knew about their relationship. George nodded. "Then we’ll trouble you, Captain Smith."

The night was pitch-black, without even a single streetlamp in the village. Andrew walked ahead with the flashlight while Luna followed silently. When they reached her home, the gate was tightly locked.

"Key," Andrew turned and held out his hand.

Flustered, Luna fished the key from her pocket and handed it to him.

Not only did Andrew unlock the gate, but he also helped tidy up inside. Before leaving, he reminded her, "Lock the door. If anything happens, come find me anytime. I’m your fiancé—if the sky falls, I’ll hold it up for you."

Luna froze. Their engagement...

"Um..."

"Tomorrow I’ll bring you money and food stamps. You’ll need to prepare a lot for school. I’ll buy your train ticket—when do you plan to leave?" Andrew continued without waiting for her response.

"That’s not necessary. I’m visiting my sister tomorrow..." Luna quickly refused. She didn’t want to owe him anything—after all, she had no intention of actually marrying him.

Andrew paused mid-step. "I’ll bring the money at noon tomorrow. If you’re not here, I’ll leave it with the mayor." Then he stood outside the door, unmoving.

Luna blinked in confusion.

"Close the door," the flashlight beam flickered across her face.

"Oh..." Luna hurriedly shut the door. So he had been waiting to make sure she locked it before leaving.

This Andrew—he was considerate, but also incredibly stubborn. Her earlier refusal might as well have been spoken to the wind.

Shaking her head, Luna washed up briefly and lay down. It seemed she wouldn’t be visiting her sister tomorrow after all. She’d go the day after.

The memory of her sister falling off a cliff while searching for her in her past life still made her heart ache like a knife twisting inside.
###Chapter 94: Gratitude Begets Gratitude

After seeing Luna White off, the relatives gradually dispersed. Night had fallen, and everyone was eager to return home to rest. Fortunately, both families lived in the same village, making the journey convenient.

Clara Clark gently wiped the sweat from Lily Clark's forehead with a towel. "Sweetheart, would you like some water? I’ll get it for you."

Lily weakly shook her head—she had no desire to drink anything at the moment.

"Mom, what happened with Luna?" Having faced death, she was no longer the naive girl she once was. From her mother’s demeanor toward Luna, she could tell the girl knew all her secrets.

"You should be grateful! If it weren’t for Luna, you would’ve—" Clara’s voice choked as she recounted everything in detail. Only then did Lily realize just how dire her situation had been.

"Silly girl, why couldn’t you talk to us? Your father was ready to write a referral so I could take you to the county hospital. It would’ve been safe there. Instead, you ran off on your own. If anything had happened to you, how could we have gone on living?" Clara scolded, torn between anger and heartache, though she knew her daughter was still recovering.

Lily pushed herself up, surprised to find her body much lighter than expected—no dizziness or weakness. Clara quickly steadied her.

"Mom, I was wrong. I just couldn’t stand it anymore. Harold Martin and his family are awful. His parents treated me like I was worthless. Even if I’d had the baby, I’d never have been respected in that household. I’d rather stay single forever than let you, Dad, or my brothers be shamed because of me." Tears welled in her eyes as she spoke.

Clara’s heart ached at her words.

"Foolish girl, no matter what, you can’t gamble with your life!" Clara wiped her tears. "Once you’re better, we’ll find you a good match."

The thought of Harold still enjoying himself in town while her daughter had nearly died made Clara’s blood boil.

"Mom, I’ll be fine," Lily murmured softly, though inwardly she vowed never to trust a man again. Harold had shattered her heart completely.

"That’s my girl. We owe everything to Luna—she saved your life." Clara sighed. "She’s such a sensible girl, never saying more than necessary. We’re deeply indebted to her."

Lily silently finished her brown sugar water and soon drifted into a deep sleep.

Clara tucked the blanket around her daughter and quietly closed the door. When she returned to the room, George Clark immediately approached.

"Is she asleep?"

Clara removed her shoes and climbed onto the bed. The moment her nerves relaxed, exhaustion washed over her. In her worry for Lily, she’d even forgotten about her own fever.

"Yes."

George had already prepared the bedding. Noticing his wife’s pale complexion, he asked worriedly, "Do you still have a fever? Should I get you some medicine?"

As soon as Clara lay down, fatigue overwhelmed her.

"No need. It’s gone already. Medicine shouldn’t be taken carelessly." She paused. "By the way, you haven’t told me everything that happened today."

George blew out the oil lamp and recounted the events from start to finish.

Hearing that Lily had already stopped breathing at one point, Clara was jolted wide awake. When she learned Luna had revived her with acupuncture, she exhaled deeply.

"George, we owe that girl an enormous debt!" Clara’s voice trembled. "She saved two lives in our family, yet she never acts like some grand savior. That alone makes her worth keeping close. My father was right—truly capable people never show off."

Remembering how Luna had saved her brother without asking for anything in return, Clara shuddered at the thought of what might have been. "If we’d treated her as poorly as others in the village, none of this would’ve happened. Integrity matters in life."

George wholeheartedly agreed. If not for Luna’s quick thinking, they might have arrived only to find their daughter’s lifeless body. The mere memory of the bloodstains in the room sent chills down his spine.

"From now on, Luna is our family’s greatest benefactor. She has no parents and is stuck with that awful grandmother. Jack White is no better—how could he not know his own daughter was abused for four years?" George’s tone was resolute. "We can’t control others, but we must repay kindness with kindness."

"I think Luna’s medical skills are extraordinary—probably inherited from her father. That girl is brilliant, surpassing even her teacher." George continued, "Let’s treat her as our own daughter. University may not charge tuition, but city living is expensive. With our two sons in the military, we have some extra funds. In a couple of days, prepare two hundred dollars for her. We’ll give her that amount every year from now on."

Clara nodded repeatedly. "Don’t worry, I’ll handle it. Luna is a good girl—she won’t let us down."

With their plans settled, the two soon fell asleep. The ordeal of the past few days had left them utterly exhausted.
###Chapter 95: Karma Strikes Back

The pungent smell of disinfectant filled the county hospital hallway. Jack White's hand trembled as he clutched the medical bill—over two hundred yuan gone in just five days! He crumpled the paper in fury.

"The doctor said there's nothing more they can do for Mom," Haofang screeched, her voice grating. "Her face is all twisted—just take her home for some acupuncture!"

Jack's expression darkened. The old woman used to be so capable, a real powerhouse in the fields. Now she could barely walk straight, needing someone to tend to her every moment.

"This is unbearable!" Haofang planted her hands on her hips. "That wretched Luna ran off, and now the old hag's paralyzed. Who's gonna work the fields? Who's gonna handle the chores?"

A loud clatter came from the ward. They rushed in to find the old woman's bowl overturned, congee spilled across the bed. Ethan was shoving his grandmother impatiently.

"You useless old crone!" Haofang yanked the woman's arm, her nails digging deep into the wrinkled flesh. "Keep this up, and you'll go hungry tonight!"

The old woman let out a guttural moan, murky tears rolling down her crooked mouth. She tried to point at the neighbor in the next bed, but her hand shook too violently to lift.

"Don't fret, Mom." Haofang suddenly beamed, her voice sickly sweet. "I'll change your sheets right away!" Then, under her breath, only for the old woman to hear: "Try that again, and I'll strangle you."

Jack watched coldly. A thought struck him, and he pulled Haofang aside. "Send Ethan a telegram. Tell him Mom's dying—demand five hundred yuan."

"Brilliant!" Haofang's eyes gleamed. "I'll go now!"

In the ward, the old woman struggled to the edge of the bed. She wanted to scream, but only choked rasps escaped. The neighbor clucked approvingly, "Such a blessed granny, with such a devoted daughter-in-law!"

The old woman shut her eyes in despair. She remembered how she'd mistreated her second son's family, how she'd deprived Luna. Karma. This is all karma.

Haofang returned with half a bowl of cold water. "Here, Mom. Drink." She deliberately tilted it, spilling the water down the woman's front. "Oh dear, look at you—can't even hold a bowl properly."

Late at night, the old woman whimpered in pain. Under the covers, Haofang's fingers pinched and twisted the soft flesh of her thighs.

"Where's all that pride now?" Haofang hissed. "Did you ever think, when you made me kneel to wash your feet, that you'd end up like this?"

Moonlight illuminated the old woman's contorted face, her tears and drool soaking the pillow. At last, she understood—the son she'd raised for thirty years had brought a viper into their home.
###Chapter 96: Discharge

Clara White sat quietly on the hospital bed at last, and a cold smirk curled at the corner of Haofang's lips. Still think you're the domineering old matriarch ruling the household? she thought. Now that you're bedridden, you should be grateful we're even feeding you.

Tears, murky with age, trickled down Clara's wrinkled cheeks. Regret gnawed at her. If only she had known Jack White and Haofang would turn out to be such ungrateful wretches, she would have treated Ethan and Iris better. Now, she had no one to care for her in her final years.

Two days ago, when Haofang had pinched her, Jack had sat right there without so much as lifting an eyelid. It was then Clara understood the torment Luna must have endured—helpless, voiceless.

"Mom, stop crying," Jack said as he pushed the door open, keeping his voice low. "The doctor says you can be discharged today. Don’t worry, your son will take care of you."

Clara frantically waved her hands. At least in the hospital, there were people around. Going home meant being at the mercy of these two. But her garbled whimpers were unintelligible.

"Looks like the old lady’s overjoyed," the elderly man in the next bed chuckled.

Jack seized the opportunity. "Yeah, she can’t wait to go home."

As they packed, the door suddenly swung open. Two uniformed officers stood at the threshold, and the room fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

"Jack White? Haofang?" one officer asked sternly.

The bundle in Haofang’s hands thudded to the floor. A cold sweat broke out on Jack’s back.

"Your daughter, Maya White, is suspected of theft. She’s currently at the station," the officer said, his words landing like a thunderclap. "Come with us."

Haofang’s legs buckled, and she nearly collapsed. "Impossible! My daughter would never—"

Jack gripped her arm tightly, forcing a smile. "Officers, we’ll just arrange for the old lady’s care and come right away."

The moment the police stepped out, the room erupted in murmurs. Some patients hastily tucked their wallets deeper into their pockets, while others pointed and whispered. Jack’s face burned with shame—he wished the ground would swallow him whole.

(The story will now explore why Maya appeared in town and the truth behind the theft. Meanwhile, what awaits Clara after being taken home? How will Jack and Haofang handle this sudden crisis?)
###Chapter 97: Terror at the Train Station

Hao Fang clutched Jack White's sleeve, her voice trembling. "Jack, how could Maya do something like this?"

Jack glanced at the eavesdropping relatives in the hallway and scowled. "Talking won't help now. Get Ethan and Bai Zhuang to discharge Mother and take her back to the village. We need to go to the police station immediately."

Hao Fang stumbled out to find their sons. Half an hour later, the couple arrived at the station's police department with an officer.

The train station was always bustling. This small county hub teemed with travelers from all directions—and pickpockets who thrived in the chaos. Inside the station, the police department was in complete disarray, filled with cries and curses.

When Jack and Hao Fang saw Maya behind the iron bars, they barely recognized her. The girl huddled in the corner, her clothes torn and dirty, bore no resemblance to the lively young woman she once was.

"Dad! Mom!"

Maya lunged toward the bars like a drowning woman grasping for a lifeline, her fingers digging into the cold metal. Bruises mottled her face, and dried blood crusted her lip. Behind her, female inmates snickered, making her shiver.

When the officer opened the gate, Maya practically leaped behind Hao Fang, trembling like a frightened rabbit.

After fleeing Iris's house that day, Maya realized she had missed the last bus. With the five hundred dollars she'd stolen from home, she reluctantly sought shelter at a nearby inn.

"No ID? Get out!" The clerk shooed her away like a fly.

As night fell, Maya grew desperate. Finally, an impatient staff member pointed her toward the train station. "Sleep on a bench there if you must."

The waiting area was packed. Maya finally found an empty seat in the early hours, clutching her bundle as she dozed off—unaware she was being watched.

A middle-aged woman in a blue dress slid closer. First, she targeted a sleeping young official nearby, then turned her attention to Maya's bulging pocket.

"My money!" the woman suddenly shrieked. "Thief!"

The station erupted into chaos. The official checked his bag and paled. "My wallet's gone!"

In the confusion, someone spotted the corner of a black wallet peeking from Maya's bundle.

"It's her!" The official yanked Maya up. "Playing innocent, huh?"

Two slaps stunned her. By the time she regained her senses, she was in an interrogation room—while the real thief had vanished.

"Officer, my daughter didn't steal anything!" Hao Fang wiped her tears frantically.

The officer glanced at Maya's bruised face and torn pocket, sighing. "The evidence is clear, and the victim insists it was her. This case—"

Jack suddenly dropped to his knees. "Please, investigate properly! My girl wouldn't even take a needle that wasn't hers!"

Outside, a train whistle pierced the night. Watching her parents' hunched figures, Maya realized for the first time what it meant to be utterly helpless.
###Chapter 98: A Narrow Escape

Maya White and the young man were escorted into the police station by the officers.

In the interrogation room, an officer slammed the wallet onto the table. With the stolen goods right there, no amount of pleading innocence would help Maya. Every witness had seen the wallet pulled from beneath her bundle.

"Officer, my grandmother is still in the hospital..." Maya sobbed pitifully.

Given her youth and first-time offense, the police decided to be lenient. She’d be released as soon as her family paid the fine.

When Jack White and his wife, Clara, arrived at the station, their faces were ashen. Learning that Maya had stolen five hundred dollars—their life savings—nearly made them faint on the spot.

"Officer, I swear I didn’t steal—" Maya still tried to deny it.

"Enough!" The officer smacked the table impatiently. "A hundred-dollar fine. Pay up and leave."

Jack clenched his jaw as he handed over the money. There was no choice—he couldn’t let her spend the holidays in custody. The village gossips would drown them in scandal.

Once outside, Maya’s legs nearly gave out. She stole glances at her father’s stormy expression and shrank back.

Clara seized her wrist. "Try running again, and your father will break your legs!"

The ride back to the village was silent, Jack’s fury palpable. Maya huddled in the corner, not daring to make a sound.

Chaos awaited them at home. Ethan and his brother had just brought their grandmother back from the hospital, only to find an empty water jug and a cold stove.

"Maya! Where the hell have you been?" Ethan roared at the sight of his sister.

Jack grabbed a fire poker from behind the door and dragged Maya inside.

"Worthless thief!" The rod whistled through the air before striking. "Stealing money! Getting arrested! You’ve shamed our family!"

Maya gasped in pain but bit back her cries. The look in her father’s eyes said he might actually kill her.

Clara intervened at the last moment. "Hitting her too hard will just cost us more in doctor’s fees..."

Jack threw the poker aside, breathing hard. "How much is left?"

Clara rushed into the bedroom and let out a piercing scream. The locked chest had been pried open—empty.

"You wretched girl!" Clara lunged at Maya, clawing at her. "That was your brother’s dowry money!"

Ethan and his brother’s sympathy vanished in an instant. Now they wanted to kick her themselves.

Maya curled into a ball in the corner, her body burning. When Jack raised the poker again, she knew he meant to beat her to death.

In that split second, she screamed, "I’ll marry him! I’ll marry Frank Harris! You can have all the dowry money!"

Silence fell. Jack’s arm froze mid-swing, his expression unreadable.

Seizing the chance, Maya crawled forward and clutched his leg. "Dad, the Harris family is offering two hundred dollars..."

Ethan and his brother exchanged glances and stepped back. Two hundred dollars could buy them two brides.

Slowly, Jack lowered the poker and hissed through gritted teeth, "We’ll arrange the betrothal with the Harris family tomorrow."

Maya collapsed to the floor, her back drenched in cold sweat. She clenched her fists in secret—surviving tonight was all that mattered. As for the Harris family? She’d find a way out later.
###Chapter 99: Karma Strikes Back

Jack White froze in his tracks as Maya's words stabbed through him like a knife. The family's meager savings had already been drained by this wretched girl, and the police station didn’t believe a cent of the old woman’s money had ended up in their hands.

Medical bills had cost over two hundred, and the fines another hundred. Now, only two hundred remained in his pocket. He’d sent a telegram to Ethan earlier—even if he couldn’t squeeze four or five hundred out of him, surely a hundred or two would come through.

Then there was Maya. Marrying her off would bring in another two hundred in dowry.

Crunching the numbers, he could scrape together five or six hundred—just enough to arrange a wife for Bai Zhuang, though the dowry would have to be downgraded. Times weren’t what they used to be.

But Jack had another thought—Bai Shan wasn’t married yet. He couldn’t pour everything into Bai Zhuang.

"Bai Shan!" Jack’s eyes gleamed with calculation. "Lock Maya in her room and nail the windows shut! Don’t let her out until the wedding day. This girl’s grown too bold—today she steals, tomorrow she’ll run. And when you can’t afford wives, don’t blame me!"

He wasn’t stupid. Maya had been caught in town—clearly trying to flee with the money. If she hadn’t been arrested, she’d have vanished without a trace.

He knew she hated the match with Frank Harris. What decent family would Clara have found for Luna? But right now, who else could he marry off but Maya?

Her reputation was ruined. If not Frank, then who? At least she’d fetch two hundred.

Without hesitation, Bai Shan and Bai Zhuang dragged Maya into the room. Wooden planks hammered against the window frame—this time, she wouldn’t escape.

Hao Fang stormed out of the house, clutching a pair of soaked pants reeking of urine. The stench made everyone cover their noses.

"Pissing herself again! How can anyone live in this filth? What girl would marry into this stinking hovel?"

Jack was still pondering what to do with the old woman when Hao Fang flung the pants into a corner, her face twisted in disgust.

"Why not move her into Luna’s old room? This place needs a proper cleaning—who could live here otherwise? Besides, the old hag’s already half-gone..."

Jack’s eyes lit up, but he feigned hesitation. "Do what you think is best. Just make sure she’s taken care of. Wait a couple of days before moving her—let’s clean the other room first."

Hao Fang smirked. She knew exactly what he meant.

By afternoon, villagers came to see Clara, only to find her slurring and immobile. They assumed she was paralyzed. A few muttered condolences before leaving—every family had their sick elders. This was Jack’s karma.

Before nightfall, Hao Fang and Jack carried Clara to a ramshackle shed beside the pigpen. They tossed her onto a mildewed quilt and left without another word.

Clara lay stiff under Luna’s old blanket, the stench of rot clinging to it.

She couldn’t understand how karma had struck so fast. She’d abandoned Luna here—now it was her turn. Heaven wouldn’t answer her cries; the earth wouldn’t heed her pleas.

No food at noon. At dusk, Hao Fang brought half a bowl of cornmeal porridge, set it on the edge of the bed, and walked away.

The pigpen reeked, but Clara had no choice. She struggled toward the bowl, her hands shaking too badly to hold it. As she leaned forward, she toppled to the ground. The bowl shattered, porridge spilling everywhere.

The old woman wailed on the dirt floor.

A lifetime of scheming, all for the sake of being cared for in old age. Her eldest son was gone—she’d poured everything into Jack. Food, clothes, every scrap went to his family. She’d crushed Ethan and the others without remorse, all for security in her twilight years.

Jack had always sweet-talked her, coaxing out every last penny. Now that she was helpless, he’d turned on her.

Just days—and already he’d left her here to die.

If no one found her, starvation would finish the job.

Clara gnashed her teeth in fury, but she couldn’t even crawl. No one would hear her screams.

For the first time, she truly regretted it.
###Chapter 100: The Good News Spreads

Luna White had just opened her eyes when the village loudspeaker blared with joyous announcements. Rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she glanced outside—the sunlight was warm and golden, filling her with a quiet contentment.

"They say the old woman's back from the hospital?" she muttered while getting dressed. The whole village had been buzzing last night—Clara White was truly paralyzed now, barely able to speak.

Luna scoffed. She had been careful—there was no way the old woman should have ended up this bad. A few acupuncture sessions from a decent doctor would have fixed the facial paralysis. But she wasn’t about to tell the Whites that.

"Good riddance," she said coldly, combing her hair in the mirror. "At least she won’t be causing trouble anymore."

After tidying up, Luna started packing for her trip to her eldest sister’s place. The bundles piled up like she was moving back home. Just as she was busy folding clothes, deafening firecrackers exploded outside.

"Who’s celebrating?" She peeked out the window—only to see a procession of villagers marching toward her house, led by Mayor George Clark. Behind him trailed nearly the entire village, young and old.

"Luna! Luna!" The children bounced excitedly.

Before she could react, the gate swung open. Clara Clark rushed in first, throwing her arms around Luna. "My dear girl, you’ve made our village proud!"

Luna blinked in confusion. "Auntie, what—?"

"Your acceptance letter from the Provincial Medical University arrived!" Mayor Clark beamed, holding up an envelope. "You’re the first university student from Liupan Village!"

Realization dawned. Her fingers trembled as she took the envelope. In her past life, she wouldn’t have dared dream of this.

"Let the kids share the luck!" someone shouted. A swarm of grubby children surged forward, tugging at her sleeves and clothes. By the time they scattered, her white blouse was smudged with dirt.

Lily Clark lingered at the back of the crowd, still pale but in good spirits. Shyly, she handed Luna a cloth-wrapped package. "Luna… I embroidered these pillowcases for you."

Luna’s chest tightened. In her past life, Lily had never treated her kindly.

Clara Clark squeezed her hand. "The village pooled together fifty dollars for your travel expenses," she whispered. "Don’t refuse—it’s from everyone’s hearts."

Luna’s eyes stung. Just as she was about to thank them, a car horn blared outside. A military-green jeep pulled up, and Andrew Smith stepped out in his crisp uniform.

"Perfect timing," he said, his gaze landing on the acceptance letter in her hands.

Instinctively, Luna hid the envelope behind her back. Why was he here again? Hadn’t they agreed to go their separate ways?

But Andrew was already saluting Mayor Clark. "On behalf of the military, I’m here to present Luna White with an award."

"What award?" The villagers erupted in chatter.

"For her outstanding service during the earthquake relief efforts," Andrew announced, pulling a red envelope from his briefcase. "The military has granted her a five-hundred-dollar scholarship."

Luna’s eyes widened. She couldn’t accept this!

Before she could refuse, Andrew leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Don’t say no. This is an official commendation—rejecting it would embarrass the organization."

Her ears burned. This man—he was downright shameless!

"And this." He produced a small box like a magician. "From my mother."

Inside gleamed a silver university badge—a commemorative pin only given to alumni of the medical school.

"Your mother?" Her voice cracked.

Andrew smirked. "Yes. She said she’s waiting for her future daughter-in-law to serve her tea."

The crowd erupted. Luna’s vision darkened—now the whole village knew she was "spoken for."
###Chapter 101: A House Filled with Joy

Six Paths Village was livelier than New Year's Day. Mayor George Clark's front yard overflowed with neighbors, all gathered around the bright red announcement pasted on his door. The gilded words "Acceptance Letter" shimmered under the sunlight.

"Luna White got into the provincial medical college!" The news spread like wildfire, reaching every corner of the surrounding villages by noon.

This was no ordinary celebration. For decades, not a single college student had emerged from the cluster of nearby villages. Now, Six Paths Village had produced a top-scoring girl, bringing pride to the entire community.

Clara Clark circulated through the crowd with a tray of sunflower seeds, while George handed out cigarettes to the men. Everyone knew the mayor wouldn’t host a feast—he was saving every penny for Luna’s tuition. Yet the villagers came anyway, tucking red envelopes into his hands—small tokens of goodwill, some with a few coins, others with a dollar or two.

Joe Clark, the village accountant, meticulously recorded each gift behind his reading glasses. George had instructed him: "These are gestures of kindness from our neighbors. We must keep track. When Luna’s no longer here, we’ll repay them on her behalf."

Inside the house, Luna packed her belongings. Lily Clark lingered at the doorway before finally stepping in.

The two girls worked in silence—one folding clothes, the other staring at her toes—until Lily suddenly spoke, her voice thick with emotion.

"Do you think I deserve this?"

Luna didn’t look up. "Why would I think that?"

"I used to bully you..."

"You think I’d waste energy holding grudges over childish nonsense?" Luna stuffed the last garment into her bundle. "If I dwelled on every slight, I’d have died from anger long ago."

Lily froze, unprepared for the response.

"Everyone makes mistakes," Luna said, tying the bundle shut. "What matters is not breaking the hearts of those who truly care for you. Look at your mother—her hair’s turned gray these past few days."

The words hit Lily like cold water. She remembered catching her mother wiping tears that morning.

"Thank you," Lily whispered. "Can I... help you make quilts sometime?"

A faint smile touched Luna’s lips. "Sure. I could use an extra pair of hands."

The tension between them dissolved as they exchanged a quiet smile.

By midday, the guests had tactfully dispersed. Luna and Lily moved around the kitchen stove—one tending the fire, the other stir-frying—working together with unexpected harmony.

Clara watched her daughter’s brisk movements and discreetly wiped her eyes. It had been ages since Lily had shown this much vitality.

Just as they finished eating, a knock sounded at the gate. Andrew Smith stood on the threshold, dust-covered, his military uniform pockets bulging.

"Is Luna here?" His gaze swept past George, searching the house.

Luna emerged from the kitchen, drying her hands. Andrew immediately pulled a brown envelope from his chest pocket.

"For you," he said in a low voice. "A letter from the provincial capital."
###Chapter 102: The Refusal

Luna wiped the water from her hands and opened the envelope. Inside were five crisp hundred-dollar bills neatly folded. She raised an eyebrow in surprise—she hadn’t expected Andrew to have saved up so much money. With a light flick of her fingers, she tucked the bills back inside and slid the envelope toward him.

"I can’t take this," she said softly but firmly. "Nathaniel’s family has already given me more than enough as thanks. Besides, once I get to the city, I can find part-time work. I won’t starve." She wasn’t ungrateful—Andrew’s kindness touched her. But given the nature of their relationship, accepting the money didn’t feel right.

Andrew frowned and pushed the envelope back toward her. "University coursework is demanding. Don’t waste time on part-time jobs." His voice was deep and resolute. "I’m your fiancé. Providing for you is my responsibility. Once I’ve made my choice, I stand by it."

A warmth spread through Luna’s chest. In her past life, she had seen plenty of empty gestures, but Andrew’s genuine care left her at a loss. She pressed her lips together and tucked the money back into the pocket of his military uniform, giving it a light pat.

"Andrew, we agreed—this engagement can be called off at any time." She turned back to washing the dishes, the water splashing loudly. "If I spend your money now, what will I repay you with if we part ways later?"

Andrew fell silent. He stood by the stove, his tall figure casting a shadow. Luna stole a glance at him—his lips were pressed into a thin line, his eyes unreadable.

"Hey, did you hear me?" She waved a hand in front of his face.

Without a word, Andrew picked up a dishcloth and began drying the dishes beside her. His long, well-defined fingers moved with the same precision as when he handled equipment on the training field.

Luna sighed inwardly. When this man went quiet, it was more unsettling than when he was angry.

By the time the kitchen was cleaned up, Clara and her family had tactfully excused themselves. Before leaving, Lily shot Luna a teasing look, making her stomp her foot in annoyance.

"I’ll take you to your sister’s place tomorrow," Andrew said suddenly.

"No need!" Luna waved her hands dismissively. "Your unit has strict rules. Don’t keep taking leave." When he looked like he might argue, she added with a half-joking tone, "Don’t worry, I’m not a child. I won’t get lost."

Andrew didn’t insist. Silently, he fetched water for her and swept the courtyard. Before leaving, he gave her a long look—one so complicated it made her heart skip a beat. Why did it feel like she was the one who had wronged him?

As night deepened, Lily brought over a hot meal. "You’ll need to catch the early bus tomorrow. No need to cook tonight," the girl said cheerfully as she set out the dishes.

Luna thanked her, ate quickly, and lay down. In the darkness, she stared at the ceiling, Andrew’s meaningful gaze replaying in her mind. After tossing and turning, she forced herself to stop thinking about it. Tomorrow, she would finally see her sister—that was what truly mattered.

In her past life, her sister had fallen off a cliff while searching for her. This time, Luna would make sure her sister lived happily and safely. The thought filled her with both sorrow and warmth, and before she knew it, she drifted into sleep.

Outside, a full moon hung quietly above the treetops.
###Chapter 103: Andrew Means Business

At half past five in the morning, Luna White was already up. She packed her belongings quietly, careful not to wake her grandmother in the next room. Her eldest sister lived in Clark Village, over a hundred miles from Six Paths Village. If she missed the early bus, she wouldn’t make it back today.

She had just reached the village entrance with two bulging bundles when an army-green jeep came into view. Andrew Smith leaned against the car door, straightening up the moment he spotted her.

"Get in." Without another word, he took the bundles from her hands and tossed them into the trunk.

Luna bit her lip. Why was this man so stubborn? She’d made herself perfectly clear yesterday...

"I can take the bus," she muttered.

Andrew was already in the driver’s seat, fingers tapping the steering wheel. "The bus requires three transfers. You wouldn’t arrive until evening."

Reluctantly, Luna pulled open the passenger door. Just as she was about to sit down, she noticed Andrew staring straight at her. His obsidian-dark eyes were unusually intense in the morning light, making her heart skip a beat.

"What?" She instinctively shrank back.

Suddenly, Andrew leaned in, his tall frame casting a shadow over her. Luna’s breath hitched as she pressed herself against the seat.

What was he doing? They were right at the village entrance!

His arm brushed past her ear as he pulled out a black strap. A soft click echoed—he’d fastened her seatbelt.

"The mountain roads are rough," he said, his voice low and slightly hoarse from sleep.

Luna’s ears burned. So she’d misunderstood...

The jeep kicked up dust as it rumbled down the dirt road. Luna stole a glance at the man behind the wheel—his military uniform crisp, his profile sharp and resolute, his fingers strong around the steering wheel.

"Turn left," she murmured, giving directions.

The car veered onto an even narrower mountain path. Then Andrew spoke abruptly. "I thought a lot about what you said last night."

Luna tensed.

"Your plan isn’t realistic." His tone was calm but firm as he kept his eyes on the road. "I’ve kissed you. Held you. The whole village knows you’re my fiancée. If we break up now, what will people think of you?"

She clenched the fabric of her clothes. "I could go to the city for school—"

"And then what?" Andrew slammed on the brakes and turned to face her. "Let me tell everyone you changed your mind? Luna, I’m not that kind of man."

Morning mist drifted through the open window, blurring the space between them.

"What do you want, then?" Her voice trembled.

Andrew reached out, gently brushing away a dewdrop caught in her hair. The tenderness in the gesture took her by surprise.

"If I agreed to be your fiancé, I’ll see it through."

Luna’s eyes widened. In the morning light, she saw the unmistakable resolve in his gaze.

Oh no. Andrew was dead serious.
###Chapter 104: Destiny's Warmth

Luna White finally realized—Andrew Smith was determined to marry her!

She bit her lip in frustration. She had returned to settle family matters, only to end up with a fiancé instead.

In this era, marrying a soldier was every girl's dream. But she had never imagined becoming someone's wife.

The shadows of her past marriage with Frank Harris ran too deep. Those nightmare-filled days had left her terrified of commitment. Living alone was simpler. Safer.

But Andrew wasn’t the type to give up easily.

Luna turned to gaze out the window, the blurring scenery mirroring her tangled thoughts. Like a scholar arguing with a soldier—no reasoning would work.

The truth was, Andrew was good to her. Gentle, considerate, always protecting her. Strangest of all, her body didn’t recoil from his touch.

Ever since her reincarnation, she had instinctively shied away from all men. Yet when Andrew held her, kissed her—she felt no discomfort.

Had her body forgotten the trauma of her past life? Or was Andrew… different?

She recalled the anomalies after using her supernatural ability. That time with Nathaniel, she should have been half-frozen. But when Andrew embraced her, his warmth had restored her almost instantly.

Even more baffling was the incident with Lily. The moment he held her, the bone-chilling cold had miraculously faded. It defied logic.

In her past life, she had developed energy serums to counteract the side effects—only to become Harold Baker’s puppet. This time, she’d rather endure the cold than repeat that mistake.

But now, Andrew seemed to be the natural antidote. His body heat dispelled her chill faster than any serum.

Luna narrowed her eyes. If that were true… marrying him might not be so bad?

But what if she was wrong? Gambling her entire future on a hunch would be reckless.

She needed more proof. Until she was certain, she wouldn’t agree.

For now, she had more pressing matters to handle.

Maya… I’m coming.
###Chapter 105: The Rugged Mountain Path

The jeep came to an abrupt halt by the dusty roadside. Ahead, at a fork in the road, stood a weathered wooden sign with the words "Clark Village" scrawled crookedly, an arrow pointing toward a winding mountain path. In the distance, the peaks loomed like ink strokes, veiled in mist.

Andrew Smith furrowed his brow and turned to Luna White in the passenger seat. "You sure this is the way?" He gestured toward the narrow trail nearly swallowed by overgrown weeds.

Luna deftly unbuckled her seatbelt and hauled several bulging bundles from the backseat. "No mistake, Captain Smith." She flashed him a smile. "You can head back to base now. I’ll manage from here."

But before she could protest, Andrew killed the engine, locked the doors with a sharp click, and strode over. Without a word, he took the bundles from her arms. The sight of the crisp-uniformed soldier carrying colorful parcels was oddly incongruous.

"What are you doing?" Luna stomped her foot in frustration. "I can handle this myself! You’ve already gone out of your way escorting me." The last thing she needed was showing up at her sister’s doorstep with a man in tow. How would she explain him? As her fiancé? Her sister would faint from shock.

Andrew adjusted his grip on the bundles, his expression resolute. "I’ve already taken leave. A little longer won’t hurt." He nodded toward the rugged path. "Carrying all this alone, you wouldn’t make it before dark." Without waiting for a reply, he set off with long strides, leaving her no room to argue.

Luna glared at his retreating back. So what if he had long legs? At 5’5", she was considered tall in the village, but next to Andrew, she felt like a scrawny child.

Clutching the last bundle, she trailed behind, a flicker of warmth blooming in her chest. As much as she hated to admit it, being looked after like this felt... nice. She scolded herself for being so easily swayed. After being reborn, shouldn’t she know better than to let her heart flutter over something so trivial?

The path proved even more treacherous than expected. Under the scorching sun, every step kicked up clouds of yellow dust. Andrew’s uniform trousers were soon coated in grime, and Luna’s cloth shoes lost their original color entirely.

"How does anyone walk this when it rains?" Luna panted, her worry for her sister deepening. What kind of life had her gentle, kind-hearted sister been living in this backwater?

Two hours later, the village finally came into view, nestled in a mountain hollow. Luna’s back ached from exhaustion, and she silently thanked Andrew for his help. Without him, she’d have collapsed halfway.

An old shepherd at the village entrance squinted at them. "Who’re you looking for?"

"Luna Whitaker. I’m her sister." Luna wiped her sweaty brow.

The old man’s expression turned odd as he pointed toward the edge of the village. "The Lewis household—the one with the stone mill out front." He shook his head as if hesitating to say more, then shuffled off with his flock.

Andrew caught the man’s strange demeanor and exchanged a glance with Luna. Neither spoke as they headed into the village, but both understood—this reunion might not be as simple as they’d hoped.
###Chapter 106 The Worthless Brother-in-Law

Luna White immediately noticed the peculiar look in the shepherd's eyes—a mix of pity, sympathy, and something indescribable. Her heart sank. Her eldest sister must be suffering terribly.

"What's happened to Iris?" She clenched the hem of her shirt.

Over the years, her two sisters had sacrificed so much for her. Especially Iris, who had married into this impoverished mountain village and still scrimped to support her. The thought made Luna's eyes burn.

"Easy," Andrew Smith said, steadying her trembling shoulders. "Let's see her first."

Luna took a deep breath. Panicking wouldn't help. At least with Captain Andrew here, they could handle whatever awaited them. She glanced at his crisp military uniform, drawing some comfort from it.

They followed the rugged mountain path into the village. A ramshackle adobe house came into view, its bamboo fence leaning haphazardly around a small yard. As they neared, they saw the vegetable garden inside was trampled—deliberately destroyed.

The creaking gate swung open, and suddenly, furious shouting erupted from inside.

"Michael Brown! He's your own son!" A woman's tearful cry pierced the silence. "I gave all my earnings to your mother! Now the boy's leg is like this—what am I supposed to do?"

"Serves you right!" a man roared. "Who told you to haul stones? If it weren't for supporting your deadweight sister, would the kids have had to help? Would they be hurt?"

Luna froze. Deadweight... That had to mean her.

A sharp slap rang out, followed by the sickening thuds of blows.

"Stop!" Andrew charged inside, Luna right behind him.

In the dim hut, a brutish man was slamming a woman's head against the wall. In the corner, a feverish teenager lay curled up, his right leg a mangled mess.

"Who the hell are you?" The man released the woman and backed away warily.

Luna rushed to help the bloodied woman up. When she recognized the battered face, her throat tightened. "Iris..."

Iris looked up, her swollen eyes widening in shock. "L-Luna?"

"It's me." Luna wiped the blood from her sister's face with shaking hands before turning to glare at the so-called brother-in-law. "Is this how you treat my sister?"

Michael faltered under Andrew's military presence but blustered, "I discipline my own woman—none of your damn business!"

"Discipline?" Luna pointed to the unconscious boy. "This is the result?"

Andrew was already examining the injury, his frown deepening. "The wound's infected. He's burning up—needs a hospital now."

"No money!" Michael jutted his chin. "Let her sister pay for it!"

Luna trembled with rage. Just then, hurried footsteps approached outside, and a shrill voice called out, "Michael! I heard soldiers are here?"
###Chapter 107: Borrowing Money

"Sis! It's me, Luna!" Luna White quickly steadied her swaying sister, Luna Whitaker.

"Luna?" Whitaker whipped her head around, wincing as the sudden movement tugged at the cut on her lip. When she recognized her younger sister, her eyes lit up with joy.

"Why are you here? Did something happen at home?" Whitaker's first thought was that her sister was in trouble. Whenever Luna visited, she was usually timid and hesitant to speak. For her to travel all this way alone—something must be seriously wrong.

How had she even made it through over a hundred miles of mountain roads by herself?

"I'm fine. I just came to see you." Luna gently touched the bruises on her sister's face before turning a cold glare toward Darren Lewis. "Brother-in-law, no matter the reason, what kind of man hits a woman?"

From what her sister had said, the Lewis family had helped the Whites in the past. But looking at Darren's sneering face, there wasn't a shred of gratitude in him. Luna saw right through him—if her sister hadn't been breaking her back hauling stones in the mountains all these years, how could the Lewis family afford to give her two dollars a month for living expenses?

In this impoverished village, even men struggled to find work. How much suffering had her sister endured to earn that money? Luna's eyes burned, but she forced back the tears. This wasn't the time to cry—she had to deal with this bastard first.

Darren recognized Luna and flinched momentarily before puffing his chest out. "This is none of your business! Here to beg for money again, huh? Well, tough luck—we're broke! My son's sick, and we can't even afford medicine for him. Where would we get money to feed you? Get lost!"

"Darren Lewis!" Whitaker trembled with rage.

Luna glanced at the unconscious child on the floor. "Sis, let's take care of the boy first. He can't stay on the ground with a fever this bad."

As the sisters moved to lift the child, Darren lunged forward to shove Luna. Andrew Smith stepped in instantly, seizing his wrist and twisting it just enough to make him yelp in pain.

"Brother-in-law, let's talk sitting down." Andrew applied a bit more pressure, forcing Darren into a chair across the room. Sweat beaded on the man's forehead from the pain.

Only then did Darren notice Andrew's military uniform, and his bravado instantly deflated. Everyone in the village knew better than to mess with military families—especially officers.

"Who the hell are you? Stop calling me brother-in-law!" he spat, though his voice lacked its earlier bite.

Luna checked the child's pulse, and her expression darkened. The leg wound had festered, and the infection was spreading. If they didn't act fast, this could turn deadly.

"This is my fiancé, a military instructor," Luna said, standing up. "Brother-in-law, the boy needs to go to the hospital immediately. If we delay any longer, the consequences will be dire."

Darren scoffed. "All our money went to your living expenses! Where would we get medical fees? Want money? Then pay back every cent you've taken from us over the years!"

Whitaker wiped her tears and stood. "Fine! Consider my money wasted on a dog! I'll borrow what I need to save my son!"

"You dare!" Darren sprang up to kick her, but Andrew sent him crashing to the ground with a single strike.

"Officer assaulting civilians!" Darren howled from the floor but didn't dare move. The look in Andrew's eyes was enough to make him believe the man would tear him apart.
###Chapter 108: The Bastard

Andrew Smith grabbed the fire poker from the corner—a thick rod as wide as a man's forearm. Paul Jackson trembled in fear. A single strike from that would shatter bones.

"Y-you can't do this..." He shrank back, his words stumbling.

Luna White stared at Andrew in surprise. The man was usually so composed—what had gotten into him? If he actually hurt someone, the military would have questions.

Just as she stepped forward, Andrew handed her the poker. "Hold it with both hands."

Understanding dawned on her. She took the rod, and Andrew delivered a swift kick.

Crack! The poker snapped in two. Luna tossed the broken pieces at Paul's feet, making him flinch again.

Andrew then hauled a stone slab from the yard. "Again."

Luna suppressed a smile. This man had a flair for theatrics.

Another kick. The slab shattered into pieces.

"Impressive skills, Instructor Smith," Luna said loudly. "If that kick had landed on a person..."

"Even a two-hundred-pound man wouldn't survive it," Andrew finished, his gaze fixed on Paul.

Paul's face paled. He was nowhere near that weight.

"Are you alright, brother-in-law?" Andrew feigned concern. "I can't stand men who hit women."

"I-I'm fine..." Paul was thoroughly cowed.

Luna Whitaker struggled to stand. "I'll go borrow money—"

Before she could finish, two teenage boys burst in—the elder sixteen, the younger fourteen. Their faces darkened at the sight of their mother's injuries.

"Did Dad hit you again?" Ethan Jackson clenched his fists. "Don't worry, Mom. We're here."

"I'm fine..." Luna Whitaker tried to leave. "Your brother still has a fever..."

"I'll get the money from Grandma!" Ethan blocked her path. "She's taken enough from us over the years to cover his treatment."

Luna Whitaker gave a bitter smile. "She won't give it..."

"Then let him ask!" Ethan glared at his father.

Luna dabbed the youngest boy's forehead with a damp cloth and chimed in, "That's right, brother-in-law. He is your son."

"Bullshit!" Paul suddenly roared. "Who knows whose bastard this is? Better off dead!"

The room fell silent.

Luna's hand stilled. What did that mean?

She glanced at her sister. Luna Whitaker's face was ghostly pale, her lips trembling, but she didn't deny it.

Could there be... some truth to it?

Luna narrowed her eyes. The waters in the Jackson family ran deeper than she'd thought.
###Chapter 109 The Divorce Storm

"Paul Jackson!" Luna White's voice trembled as her fingers clutched the hem of her shirt. "I've lived with integrity my whole life, and Samuel is your flesh and blood! For years I've managed this household, worked the fields—haven't I given my all? How dare you say such things in front of the children? Have you no conscience?" She turned to rush out the door but was restrained by her two older sons.

Paul sneered, pointing at their unconscious youngest son on the bed. "Look at his face—pale and delicate. Nothing like me. Ethan and Aaron are my true sons, dark and strong, the very image of the Jackson bloodline! The village has whispered behind my back for years. I've tolerated this disgrace long enough!"

Luna White stood nearby, her gaze shifting between her three nephews. The elder two bore a striking resemblance to Paul, but though Samuel favored his mother, his features still carried traces of his father's lineage.

"Your mother warned me you'd betray me!" Paul's voice rose with fury. "Ethan and Aaron dropped out of school without complaint, yet you insisted on sending this bastard to study! My sons break their backs hauling stones just to feed this stray you brought home!"

"Dad!" Ethan Jackson stepped forward. "How can you speak to Mom like that? Samuel is our brother! Hasn't she suffered enough? If she'd truly betrayed you, she would've left for her parents' home years ago. Why would she stay in this wretched village?"

Tears streamed down Luna's face as she pulled her sons close. Her greatest pride was raising children who understood right from wrong.

"Defying me now?" Paul roared, striking Ethan across the face. "She's poisoned you all! Here's my final word—either you four leave today, or every penny you earn goes to me. And Samuel gets no treatment for his illness!"

Luna threw herself between them. "Hit me if you must! What have the children done wrong?" Her entire body shook. "Paul, is this truly your decision? To cast us out with nothing?"

Paul lit a cigarette with a cruel smirk. "What's divorce to you? Listen well—the house and land go to Aaron. You won't get a single cent! A divorced woman is worthless. Let's see who'd want you then!"

Luna White, pale as death, flinched. Luna stepped forward. "Brother-in-law, don't be so certain. If this divorce happens, regret may not be on her side."

Silence fell, broken only by Luna's stifled sobs. The three boys encircled their mother, eyes burning with anger and confusion. Outside, the setting sun bathed the courtyard in blood-red light, as if foreshadowing the family's impending collapse.
###Chapter 110: A Family Matter?

Luna White stared daggers at Samuel Jackson, her nails digging deep into her palms. It was clear Paul Jackson intended to drive her youngest son to ruin today, but she'd rather die herself than let anything happen to her child. Divorce it is! The thought crystallized in her mind with startling clarity for the first time. She couldn't spare a thought for how she'd survive afterward—saving her son was all that mattered now.

Before her children, she would always remain their strongest protector.

"Paul Jackson! Fine, we'll divorce. But half the family savings belong to me—I earned it. I'm taking all three boys with me, and from today onward, we sever all ties with the Jackson family." Luna stood tall, her voice ringing with conviction.

Luna's sister Iris gave an approving nod. At least her sister wasn't being foolish—she was finally standing up for what was rightfully hers. Compared to their other sister Maya, Luna had far more backbone.

"Bullshit!" Paul exploded, face purpling with rage. "You shameless whore! You think you can take my money and run off with your bastards? I should be charging you child support for all these years! Get out now—take your brats and disappear!" His entire body trembled with fury. The usually docile Luna daring to demand money from him was unthinkable.

Luna's laugh was icy. "Paul Jackson, my conscience is clear. Samuel is your biological son whether you acknowledge it or not. I want my share—I've kept accounts. Your mother took seven hundred eighty-five dollars from me. Give me three hundred ninety now, and I'll leave immediately. Otherwise, we'll take this to the village mayor!"

Paul saw red, his hand twitching with the habitual urge to strike her. A cold snort from Andrew Smith made him stumble back. The soldier wasn't someone to trifle with.

"No lover, huh?" Paul's beady eyes darted to Andrew as he shouted, "Everyone see this? An official seducing a married woman and assaulting me! I'll make sure the whole village knows!" He'd decided to pin this on Andrew, determined to make Luna suffer in silence.

Luna paled, ready to protest, but Iris gripped her arm. "Go ahead, call everyone! Andrew is my fiancé—let the mayor see what happens when you slander a military officer!"

Andrew stepped forward, his gaze glacial. "Sister Luna, summoning the mayor is perfect. The bruises on you are evidence. Current marriage laws consider domestic violence a crime. We won't need to give him a single cent—we can send him to jail instead." He deliberately exaggerated the consequences. For ignorant bullies like Paul, fear worked best.

Paul's face drained of color. "Lies! Since when can't a man discipline his wife? This is family business—even the police won't interfere! I never said anything—don't you dare frame me!" His bravado evaporated instantly as he backtracked.

"Family business?" Iris's lips curled. Suddenly she lunged forward. Haunted by memories of Frank Harris's beatings in her past life, she'd trained extensively in self-defense. Handling trash like Paul was child's play.

In one fluid motion, she grabbed Paul's arm and flipped him over her shoulder, slamming him onto the ground. Before he could react, her elbow drove into his stomach. As Paul writhed, she rained down punches and kicks.

"You dare hit my sister? You call this family business? Well, a sister-in-law beating her brother-in-law is also family business!" Each word punctuated by another brutal strike. "From now on, I'll beat you every time I see you—let's see who can stop this 'family business'!"

Paul's pig-like squeals drew a crowd of villagers. Luna hastily pulled her sister back. "Iris, stop! He's not worth it!"

Iris delivered one final kick before snarling, "Listen well, Paul Jackson! My sister is divorcing you! She married you without demanding a single dowry, even used her own savings to pay your medical bills and support your family—and this is how you repay her? Ungrateful worm!"

As Paul curled into a whimpering ball on the ground, several villagers already sprinted off to alert the Jackson family.
###Chapter 111: Fanning the Flames

Darren Lewis pointed at Luna White as the villagers gathered around. "You little bitch dared to hit me? You won’t leave Clark Village alive today!" He wiped the blood from his lip, his eyes glinting with malice. With the crowd backing him, his confidence surged.

Everyone knew how fiercely villagers protected their own.

"Look at this, folks!" Darren shouted, playing the victim. "Someone from Six Paths Village is bullying us! Luna sent her sister to beat me—where’s the justice in that?" He clutched his swollen cheek, exaggerating his pain. "I’m divorcing Luna! I won’t keep this vicious woman!"

Then he twisted the narrative, stirring the pot: "If we let outsiders humiliate us today, how will our village ever hold its head high? What respect will our married daughters have in their husbands’ homes? If you’re real men of Clark Village, stand with me!"

A cunning move—turning a domestic dispute into a feud between villages, using the crowd to punish Luna.

The villagers exchanged uneasy glances. One man rolled up his sleeves, but his friend stopped him. "Don’t be rash! That man looks like an official. Touch him, and you’ll face the law!"

"Fetch the mayor!" someone yelled.

Luna stepped forward with her sister, her voice clear and firm. "Uncles, aunties, I’m Luna’s sister, Luna White. I came to visit today and found Darren beating her until her face was covered in blood!" She lifted Luna’s collar, revealing the dark bruises.

"Their child is gravely ill. My sister only wanted the money she earned to save him, but Darren threatened divorce and to throw her out with nothing!" Luna’s eyes reddened. "A man like him isn’t worth dirtying my hands over."

She scanned the crowd. "Today, we demand a divorce—with a fair division of assets under the law. My sister will take the three children so they won’t suffer under a stepmother. If Darren refuses, we’ll take him to court!"

At the mention of legal action, the villagers retreated.

Darren panicked. "Bullshit! Why should she get my property?" He groaned, clutching his stomach—Luna’s kicks had left him aching inside.

"Enough!" Mayor Simon Liu arrived, panting, his expression weary. "What’s so entertaining about a marital spat?"

At his command, the crowd dispersed.

Simon glared at Darren, disgusted. Pathetic—beaten by a girl. His gaze turned cold toward Luna. This woman only brings trouble.
###Chapter 112: Go Die

"Luna, have you lost your mind?" Simon Liu slammed the table and stood up, his jowls trembling. "No matter how wrong your husband is, he's still your husband! What kind of nonsense is it to have your sister hit him? Divorce? How will you survive as a woman raising three sons alone?"

Darren Lewis hid behind the mayor, a smug grin on his face. He knew no one in Clark Village would dare not take his side.

Luna White stepped in front of her sister, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Mayor, can't you see what Darren did to my sister? I hit him to deliver justice! You want to arrest me? Fine, let's see when you, a mayor, gained authority over the police station!"

Simon's face turned ashen. In all his years as mayor, no one had ever spoken to him like this.

"You little brat, do you own the courthouse?" he sneered. "A marital spat isn't worth a divorce! Luna, tell me yourself—what will you use to feed your three sons if you leave him?"

Luna lifted her head, the bruises on her face horrifying. "I want a divorce! Haven't I suffered enough beatings all these years? Now he doesn't even care about our son's life—I can't live like this anymore!"

"Good!" Luna clapped. "Sis, I support you! I'm a college student—I'll fight this case with you to the end!"

Simon finally panicked. He turned to Darren. "What do you say?"

"Let her divorce!" A shrill voice cut in. Margaret Lewis hobbled in on her cane, her beady eyes glinting. "But if she wants out, she won't get a single penny!"

Darren immediately straightened. "That's right! Not a cent!"

Luna scoffed. "Every penny was earned by my sister. Why shouldn't she take it?"

Margaret gave a sinister smile. "Because she's shameless, bearing a bastard! If not for our Lewis family's kindness, a woman like her should've been paraded in shame long ago!"

Luna trembled. "Samuel is a Lewis! I swear to heaven!"

"Swear?" The old woman spat. "If you're truly innocent, then go die! Only then will I believe you!"

Tears spilled from Luna's eyes. Years of humiliation crashed over her like a tidal wave. Suddenly, she grabbed the scissors from the table and stabbed toward her own chest—

"Sis!" Luna lunged forward, gripping her wrist with all her strength.

The scissors clattered to the floor.

Luna, her eyes red, turned to Margaret. "Well, since you're so eager to see my sister die, why don't you go first?"
###Chapter 113: The Final Confrontation

Luna White's gaze remained fixed on her sister Maya's every move. When she noticed Maya's pale face and vacant stare, her heart lurched. No! She's thinking of ending her life! Luna dashed forward and seized Maya's wrist with a firm grip.

"Mrs. Lewis," Luna's voice was icy. "When my parents arranged Maya's marriage into your family, they never imagined you'd be so cruel as to let your own grandson die without lifting a finger!"

She turned to Maya. "Sis, the city hospital has new technology now—a simple blood test can prove paternity. Let’s take Samuel for the test. Once the results come out, we’ll shove them in Darren’s face! Then he won’t get a single penny, let alone half the family assets!"

The words snapped Maya out of her despair. She jerked her head up, a spark of hope igniting in her eyes.

"Really?" Ethan and Aaron Jackson exclaimed in unison. "Aunt Luna, we’ll work hard to earn the money! We won’t let Mom and Samuel suffer this injustice!"

Maya wiped her tears and clenched her jaw. "Even if it kills me, I’ll clear Samuel’s name!"

"Bullshit!" Darren Lewis sneered, rubbing his hands greedily. "Blood tests? Who are you trying to fool? Hurry up and sign the divorce papers—I’ve got a new wife waiting!"

Old Mrs. Lewis’s eyes darted nervously. She knew Maya was a good woman, but with her son dead set on divorce, she had to side with blood over reason.

"Did you earn that money?" Luna scoffed. "Darren, the way you beat your wife is enough to land you in prison!"

"Who are you trying to scare?" Darren jutted his chin defiantly. "Remember when Old Wang’s wife complained to the Women’s Federation? She still crawled back home in the end!"

Luna trembled with rage. "Fine! Sis, let’s go to the town government right now! Andrew’s car is parked outside—we’ll drive straight to the county office! Let’s see if they’ll ignore a life hanging in the balance!"

A dark thought flashed through her mind. What if… this bastard just disappeared? She startled at her own impulse. No. That’s too easy for him.

Andrew Smith had already scooped up Samuel. "Ethan, Aaron—help me carry him."

Mayor Simon Liu panicked and stepped in. "Captain Smith, escalating a family matter will only hurt the children—"

Andrew pressed a hand to Samuel’s feverish forehead. "Mayor Liu, this is a matter of life and death. If the Lewis family won’t pay for medical treatment, then let the government decide what’s fair."

Cold sweat dripped down Simon’s back. This soldier isn’t someone you can fool…


###Chapter 114: Relentless Pressure

"Paul Jackson, know when to quit," Simon Liu muttered under his breath, his gaze sweeping over the mother and son. "That girl isn't someone to mess with—her husband's a soldier. If this escalates to the authorities, you can kiss those relief funds and tax exemptions goodbye."

A chill ran down Paul's spine. What chance did a commoner like him have against the government?

"Well..." He rubbed his hands together, eyes darting nervously.

Margaret Jackson shot her son a withering glare. Useless fool—still worrying about money at a time like this!

"Mayor, let them divorce," the old woman said, pressing her thin lips together. "But we settle every debt—down to the last penny."

Paul groaned as he massaged his lower back. That sister-in-law of his had kicked him so hard he still couldn’t straighten up.

Simon exhaled in relief. As long as the old woman conceded, things could move forward.

"Luna," he turned to the White sisters, "the Jacksons are willing to give you some money. You’ll need it to start over."

Luna dug her nails into her palms, eyes burning. She’d do anything to save her children.

The two families finally sat down to negotiate.

Margaret narrowed her beady eyes. "Luna, I won’t stop you from leaving. But let’s be clear—don’t push your luck."

"Mother, I don’t want the house or land," Luna said hurriedly. "Just half the wages and the three kids—"

Luna White’s heart sank. Her sister was showing her hand too soon!

The calculating glint in Margaret’s wrinkles sharpened.

"Money?" The old woman slowly pulled out a handkerchief. "Household expenses have been tight. We’ve only got four hundred left. Two hundred for you—fair enough?"

Luna scoffed. Ethan had just said they’d handed over over seven hundred—now suddenly more than half was gone!

"Fine. Two hundred it is," Luna gritted her teeth. She just wanted the money to get out.

Margaret’s lips curled. "Money’s simple. But Ethan and Aaron stay. They’re Jacksons!"

"What?" Luna shot to her feet, her two sons clutching her sleeves.

Ethan’s eyes reddened. Since when had Grandma ever treated them as family? When they’d starved and begged for scraps, she’d refused even leftover food!

"Please, Grandma!" Luna dropped to her knees. "If they stay, their stepmother will beat them to death!"

Margaret smirked inwardly. Did she really think she’d get both the money and the kids?

"Here’s the deal," she said faux-magnanimously. "Leave the money, take the kids. Your choice."

Luna trembled. They wanted to strip her bare!

Luna White’s eyes narrowed. A classic retreat-as-advance tactic—this old woman was vicious.
###Chapter 115: Mother and Sons United

Luna White's fingers twisted together until her knuckles turned white. The old woman's move was ruthless—forcing her to abandon her own flesh and blood. How could she choose between her children?

"Mom..." Ethan Jackson suddenly released his grandmother's sleeve and pulled his younger brother back. "We'll stay with the Lewises. You take the money to treat Samuel." The boy's voice trembled but held firm.

Luna's heart clenched, tears threatening to spill. These foolish children were making the impossible choice for her.

Nearby, Luna's sister nodded approvingly. Her nephews were thoughtful, understanding their mother's pain. She stepped forward and linked arms with Luna. "They're right. Teenage boys belong with their father. Darren Lewis won't let his own sons starve. Besides, in a few years, they'll need dowries—that's no small expense—"

"Bullshit!" Darren Lewis sprang up, jabbing a finger at his sons. "Take these burdens and get out! I can barely feed myself—how am I supposed to provide for them?"

Luna's sister shot the boys a meaningful glance. Aaron Jackson hesitated, then caught on. He grabbed his brother and threw himself at Darren's feet.

"Dad! We can't leave!" The brothers clung to Darren's legs, wailing. "With Mom, we'll be beggars! Grandma's house is dirt-poor, and Aunt Luna depends on charity!"

Darren kicked them away in irritation. "Scram! Who needs you for support? Go with your cursed mother!"

Luna hurried to help her sons up, tears finally falling. "Come with me, my darlings. Even if we have to beg, I won't abandon you."

Old Mrs. Lewis sighed. She'd hoped to keep two strong laborers, but Luna's sister had a point. She knew her son's worth—he couldn't even care for himself, let alone two growing boys.

"Mrs. Lewis," Luna's sister interjected smoothly, "if you won't take the children, at least provide child support. Raising three alone—"

"No money!" Darren bellowed. "Look at this shack—where would I get any?"

Luna tugged her sister's sleeve. "Let it go. Just being able to take them is enough."

Simon Liu, witnessing this, began drafting an agreement. Luna's sister scanned it, her heart aching. After decades of labor for the Lewises, this was her sister's reward.

When the documents were signed, Luna gathered her three sons in a fierce embrace. From this day forward, the four of them would answer to no one.
###Chapter 116: Homecoming

The old woman reluctantly counted out two hundred dollars, her fingers gripping the bills tightly. Luna White snatched the money away, her nails leaving red marks on the wrinkled wrist.

"Ow!" The old woman yelped, shaking her hand in pain.

Darren Lewis was about to lunge forward when Andrew Smith kicked over a stool, sending him scrambling back behind his mother like a frightened hen.

The divorce paperwork would have to be finalized tomorrow at the township office. Luna gathered her children’s tattered clothes while her younger sister, Luna, hauled away every last bag they had brought—better to feed the dogs than leave anything behind for the Lewises.

As they stepped through the gate, Luna’s eyes suddenly welled up. Sixteen years of her life, no matter how miserable, still carried tangled emotions she couldn’t name.

"Big sis, we’re going home," Luna said, linking arms with her.

"Home…" Luna repeated softly.

It wasn’t until they were in the jeep that Luna remembered with a jolt, her face paling. "Luna, will Grandma and Uncle even let us through the door?"

She held her feverish youngest son in her lap while her two older boys squeezed awkwardly into the backseat. A whole family suddenly returning…

"What’s there to fear?" Luna grinned, her eyes crinkling. "We’re going to our home. I moved out ages ago. Andrew helped me fix up the place—it’s been too quiet without company."

Luna gaped. "You’ve been living alone? That’s dangerous!"

"Still safer than letting Grandma kill me," Luna muttered. "She even tried to hide my university acceptance letter so I’d work and save up for Ethan’s wedding dowry."

"Those monsters!" Luna trembled with rage. "I’ll pay for your tuition!"

Andrew watched the sisters through the rearview mirror. What kind of life had this girl endured? No wonder she’d been half-dead when he first met her…

As the jeep rolled into the village, children chased after it, shouting excitedly.

Luna swiftly unlocked the gate. Andrew carried the unconscious boy inside, laying him on the heated brick bed before heading out to chop firewood and fetch water.

"I’ll get the doctor—" Luna turned to rush out.

"No need." Luna stopped her, explaining again about her supernatural ability.

Tears spilled down Luna’s cheeks as she cupped her sister’s face. "Tell everyone you learned acupuncture from our parents! Even Ethan and Aaron must believe that!"

"Got it." Luna smiled, pulling out silver needles.

The boy’s leg injury was gruesome. He whimpered faintly as the needles went in, but by the time they were removed, the festering wound had vanished, leaving only a faint scar.

Luna was about to gasp when she noticed her sister’s face had gone deathly pale, her entire body shaking violently.

Andrew burst in, wrapping Luna in a thick quilt before scooping her up like a bundled parcel.

"She—she—" Luna stammered, pointing.

"An old problem. She gets freezing after healing," Andrew said, tightening his hold. "Could you make some ginger tea, sis?"

Luna rushed out, tripping over the threshold. The clatter of pots and muffled sobs soon drifted from the kitchen.

Andrew looked down at the girl in his arms. Frost clung to Luna’s lashes, but she blinked up at him playfully.

"Foolish girl," he sighed, draping his military coat over her.
###Chapter 117: Household Registration

Luna White curled up in Andrew Smith's arms, this time deliberately focusing on the sensation. As soon as her skin touched his, warmth surged from his body like a steady current. It felt like soaking in a hot spring in winter, the heat gradually seeping into her chilled limbs.

She pressed her small hand against Andrew's firm chest. The moment her fingertips met his scorching skin, the cold inside her receded like a tide. Even her weary spirit lifted.

Luna mused to herself: Andrew is like a tailor-made antidote for me—one with no side effects.

But it was strange.

In her past life, she had tried seeking warmth from others, but it had never worked this instantly. Did reincarnation come with hidden perks?

No. Though her supernatural ability had awakened earlier this time, she had still suffered from its icy backlash at first. It wasn’t until Andrew appeared that things improved.

The key lay with this man.

What made them so uniquely compatible?

Was it because he had been present when her ability awakened? Did that grant him the power to counteract its side effects?

Luna made a silent decision: Next time, I’ll test using my ability without him nearby. Only then can I confirm if he’s truly my "antidote."

If he really was… then she might never be able to leave him.

Andrew felt the restless little head against his chest, his ears warming slightly. He subtly shifted away.

Just then, Maya White entered with a bowl of ginger tea, only to find Luna already energetically folding blankets. Andrew was outside fixing the window, while her two nephews had the heated bed warm and toasty.

As the family bustled about, Clara Clark arrived with her daughter Lily Clark, carrying a basket brimming with fresh vegetables and a dozen eggs.

"Auntie!" Maya hurried forward. "I was just about to come see you after tidying up."

Clara chuckled, handing over the basket. "No need for formalities! I heard you were back and wanted to check in." She turned to Luna. "Right, dear? A godmother visiting her goddaughter is only natural."

Luna blinked. "Godmother?"

Clara feigned offense. "What? Am I not worthy of the title?" She had long planned to formally adopt Luna, strengthening their family ties.

Luna smiled faintly. "You’re absolutely right, Godmother."

Clara beamed. "Words aren’t enough! Soon, your godfather will host a proper celebration feast to make it official."

"Don’t rush, Godmother," Luna gestured to the still-unpacked room. "Let’s wait until my sister settles in first."

Only then did Clara notice Maya’s uneasy expression and the two hardworking boys in the yard. "Did you… come back just to help Luna pack for university?"

Maya flushed, stammering incoherently.

Seeing this, Luna cut in bluntly. "She divorced Darren Lewis. That bastard refused to pay for his own son’s critical treatment, claiming he couldn’t afford to raise three boys. Now she’s back with her sons." She clasped Clara’s hands. "Godmother, could you help transfer their household registration to our family?"

Clara’s eyes widened in understanding. She sighed, watching the diligent boys. "What a tragedy… Back then, your father had no choice. Old Mr. Lewis died saving him, and his whole family knelt at the village entrance demanding marriage… Who knew it would end like this?"

She shook her head. "If your parents were watching from beyond, they’d be furious enough to rise from their graves."
###Chapter 118: The Household Registration Storm

Luna White's eyes welled up with tears as her fingers clutched the hem of her dress. "Aunt Clara, it wasn't my parents' fault. I was already eighteen that year—old enough to understand everything. I was the one who begged my father on my knees to agree." Her voice trembled. "He'd rather be called ungrateful by the whole village than watch me throw myself into that living hell..."

Clara Clark patted her hand gently. "Child, don't say anymore. I'll discuss this with Mayor George when I get back." She frowned slightly. "Your household registration won't be an issue, but the three boys..." Her words trailed off, unspoken.

The village gossip was something she knew all too well.

Luna White handed her a cup of warm tea. "Godmother, there's no rush. My brother and I still have two acres of land—we'll make do for now." Her gaze was resolute. "We won't let ourselves be backed into a corner."

"Thank you, Aunt Clara!" Luna wiped her tears. Having the mayor's family on their side was better than facing this alone.

Clara stood to leave. "Your grandmother returned yesterday. You should..." She didn't finish, but the implication was clear. Old Mrs. White wouldn't make things easy.

"Luna's starting university soon. Don't give anyone ammunition." These words came straight from the heart.

Luna smirked coldly. "Let her strut around for a few more days." Going to see her now? That would be letting the old witch off too lightly.

Lily Clark stared longingly at Luna but was tugged away by her mother. Luna quickly stuffed a pack of rice crackers into their basket.

"What's this?" Clara protested.

Luna pressed her hand firmly. "If you refuse, it means you look down on us sisters."

After seeing their guests off, Andrew Smith also rose to leave. Luna shoved a bag of pastries into his hands. "For the road." The brief brush of their fingertips sent an inexplicable warmth to her ears.

That afternoon, the village loudspeakers blared.

"Eighteen dollars and twenty cents per household!" Before Mayor George could finish, the crowd erupted.

"That's outrageous!" "Where are we supposed to get that kind of money?"

Amid the chaos, Mayor George casually mentioned Luna's household registration. As expected, no one paid attention—compared to the real money they had to fork over, who cared about a few more mouths to feed on relief rations?

The next day, Luna headed straight to the township office with her divorce papers in hand. Darren Lewis was all too eager to rid himself of these "burdens" and signed faster than anyone.

At the police station entrance, Mayor George was already waiting. The documents were handed through the window, and with a sharp thud, the official seal came down.

From that day forward, Luna and her three sons would put down roots in Six Paths Village.
###Chapter 119: A New Beginning

Sunlight streamed through the window, warming Samuel Whitaker's face as he blinked awake. His stomach growled loudly.

"Mom, I'm hungry!" he called out.

Luna Whitaker nearly dropped her ladle at the sound of her son's voice. She rushed into the room, tears welling up when she saw Samuel's bright eyes gazing at her.

"You're awake! Thank goodness!" Luna wiped her cheeks before turning to serve the tomato noodle soup she'd prepared.

Luna White stood in the doorway, smiling knowingly. She'd anticipated Samuel waking today and had asked her sister to make his favorite soup.

"Slow down, don't choke," Luna chided gently as her son devoured the meal.

Samuel clutched the large bowl, slurping up the vibrant red tomatoes, green spinach, and perfectly round poached egg. Never had soup tasted so delicious.

"Mom, why are we at Aunt Luna's?" Samuel paused mid-bite, chopsticks hovering. "Won't Dad..."

The spoon clinked sharply against the bowl as Luna's hand trembled.

Luna White ruffled Samuel's hair. "You'll be living with me from now on. Happy?"

Samuel's face lit up, then clouded. "What about Mom and my brothers?" He bit his lip. "If they're not coming, I won't stay either."

Luna chuckled. "Such loyalty."

Tears threatened again as Luna remembered how this child always protected her, throwing himself between her and Darren's fists.

"We're all staying here," Luna whispered. "We're never going back."

Samuel nearly dropped his bowl. His wide eyes darted between the two women before he burst into tears.

"Really? We don't have to see Dad anymore?" Snot mixed with tears on his flushed face.

Luna quickly wiped him clean. "Really. I divorced him."

Samuel leapt up, almost putting a hole in the bedding with his excited jumping until Luna pulled him down.

"You'll break the bed!" she scolded.

Samuel sat obediently, though his grin kept creeping back. He pinched himself and yelped—definitely not dreaming!

"Mom, when I grow up, I'll give you the best life!" Samuel declared, puffing his small chest.

Luna White laughed heartily. "Ambitious! But for now, just focus on school."

At the mention of school, Luna's brow furrowed as she mentally calculated expenses.

Luna White immediately understood, pulling three hundred-dollar bills from her pocket. "Here, for starters."

"I..." Luna's hands shook—she'd never held so much money.

"Don't worry," Luna White reassured. "With the new policies, we can raise pigs and chickens for income. Look at Harold's family—they built a new house just selling goods at the market..."

Hope kindled in Luna's eyes as she realized possibilities she'd never dared imagine in Clark Village were commonplace here.

"Mom, I want to go to school," Samuel said softly, eyes shining.

Luna pulled him close. "You will. I'll make sure of it."

Sunlight stretched their three shadows across the floor. For the first time, Luna felt the warm glow of hope for their future.
###Chapter 120: Sisters' Secret Plan

Samuel Jackson clenched his fists, his eyes shining as he stared at his aunt. The calm confidence in her voice ignited a fire in his heart. He swore silently to himself: I'll get into college just like Aunt Luna and make something of myself.

"Where did this money come from?" Luna Whitaker trembled as she held three crisp hundred-dollar bills—more cash than she'd ever seen in her life.

Luna White smirked. "I saved someone, and they gave it to me. I wanted to hand it over properly today, but after seeing Darren's face..." She lowered her voice. "If this money went into the Lewis household, they'd probably gamble it all away."

Tears welled up in Luna Whitaker's eyes. Her little sister had thought of everything.

"Don't hold back, sis." Luna White clasped her sister's rough hands. "The kids are growing. I get stipends at college, and I can take side jobs—"

"No!" Luna Whitaker shook her head violently, tears splashing down. "I'm the older sister. How can I take your money—"

Thud!

Luna White suddenly slammed the table and stood. "Sis! When you saved your own rations to feed me all those years ago, did I ever say no?" She shoved the money into Luna Whitaker's pocket. "Take it!"

Samuel rushed over, wiping his mother's tears with his sleeve. "Mom, we'll remember Aunt Luna's kindness. When I grow up, I'll pay her back twice over!"

Luna Whitaker laughed through her tears and ruffled her son's hair. She was being silly—what mattered now was making a better life for them all.

"Oh, right." Luna White dropped her voice to a whisper. "File for divorce tomorrow. The day after, we'll go demand the land from Uncle Jack."

Luna Whitaker paled. "But Uncle Jack—"

"Who cares?" Luna White scoffed. "If he refuses, you're coming to the city with me. The policies are loosening now—even setting up a street stall beats farming!"

Luna Whitaker hesitated. City life wasn't that simple. Without a household registration, they wouldn't even get food rations...

Luna White saw her sister's worry but couldn't explain. How could she say, I'm reincarnated—I know private businesses will thrive soon?

Thinking of tomorrow's meeting with Clara White, Luna White's lips curled into a cold smile. The old woman was probably living very comfortably right now.

Meanwhile, by the pigpen in the White household, Fiona Lewis was dragging Clara White by the collar and throwing her onto a tattered mat.

"Disgusting old hag! Wetting the bed again!" Fiona pinched her nose and flung the stinking blanket at the old woman. "No dinner for you—save the food for someone who deserves it!"

Clara collapsed onto the mat, her cloudy eyes burning with hatred. That bitch! And that ungrateful son of mine!

Fiona suddenly bent down, digging her nails into Clara's arm. "What are you glaring at? Who else would take care of you now? Your precious son won't even visit!"

The stench of the pigpen was nauseating. Clara gritted her teeth, cursing inwardly: Strike them down, heavens! Smite these monsters!


###Chapter 121: The Land Is Gone

The morning sun had just begun to spill into the yard when Luna White dragged her sister Maya toward Jack White's house in a hurry. Luna clutched a package of sponge cakes so tightly her knuckles turned white.

"Don't worry, sis," Maya whispered, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze.

The moment they stepped into the courtyard, they found Aunt Clara feeding chickens with her hands on her hips. Spotting them, she immediately sneered, "Well, well, if it isn't the divorced daughter of the White family! Got the nerve to show your face here, huh?"

Luna stiffened. The news of her divorce had spread like wildfire after the village meeting two days ago. Jack and his wife had been furious—they'd planned to seize Luna's house once Maya left for school. But now, with Luna returning with three children, their scheme had fallen apart.

"Auntie, we're here to see Grandma," Maya said brightly, stepping in front of Luna.

Clara blocked their path with her foot and jerked her chin toward the backyard. "The old lady moved to your place—said it was too noisy here." She reached for the cakes. "Just hand those over. Her teeth are bad—needs them soaked before she can eat."

Maya swiftly tucked the package behind her back. "No need. We'll take care of Grandma ourselves."

A roar came from inside the house. "Luna! Stop right there!"

Luna froze, and Maya immediately linked arms with her.

"Maya, go check on Grandma first," Jack barked as he stormed out, clearly trying to get rid of her.

"Uncle, is there something you can't say in front of me?" Maya smiled innocently. "Or are you scheming against us again?"

Jack's mustache quivered with rage. "Maya! Where's your respect for your elders?"

"Elders?" Maya scoffed. "My parents taught me not to be polite to relatives who only think about swindling family!"

Luna tightened her grip on Maya's hand. "Uncle, just say what you want."

Jack shot Maya a glare before turning to Luna. "What kind of woman gets divorced? Take those kids back to your husband and apologize! The White family can't afford this shame!"

Luna paled. If she could go back, would she have fled covered in bruises?

"Uncle!" Maya shielded her sister. "She barely escaped with her life after what that Jackson family did to her! Instead of caring for your niece, you're siding with outsiders?"

"You—!" Jack jabbed a finger at Maya. "Fine! Since you won't listen, don't come begging later!"

"Great!" Maya's eyes flashed. "Then return our two acres of land!"

Clara jumped in. "Dream on! That land was transferred to Grandma's name ages ago! It's all legal and signed!"

Maya's heart sank. Just as she'd suspected—Grandma had already swindled the land away. Without it, Luna wouldn't survive in the village.

"Come on, sis. Let's see Grandma first." She tugged Luna toward the backyard, her mind already racing. Did Jack really think he could drive them out? Not a chance.

As they reached the backyard, a loud crash came from inside. The sisters exchanged a glance and rushed in—only to find Clara White trying to climb off the bed, her face suspiciously flushed for someone supposedly ill.

"Grandma, what are you—?" Maya narrowed her eyes.

The old woman looked up sharply, her cloudy eyes flickering with panic...
###Chapter 122: Karma Strikes Back

Luna White stood before the low adobe hut, tears streaming down her face. She gripped her sister's hand so tightly her nails nearly dug into Luna's flesh. "You lived here?" Her voice trembled uncontrollably.

The shack beside the pigpen reeked of filth, its walls peeling and roof leaking. Luna's chest tightened as she recalled the monthly allowance she'd sent to their grandmother, the weight of betrayal crushing her lungs.

"Sis, it's over now," Luna murmured softly, her cold gaze flickering toward the rickety wooden door.

Wiping her tears, Luna remembered how her sister had always been working in the front yard whenever she visited. Who could have imagined Luna slept in such squalor at night?

The door creaked open with a piercing screech.

The stench of urine hit them like a wall, forcing them back half a step. Inside the dim room, Clara White lay on the kang like a desiccated corpse, only a grimy sheet covering her lower half.

"Grandma!" Luna rushed forward.

Clara hadn't eaten a proper meal in three days. Her clouded eyes rolled before suddenly flashing with manic energy, her bony fingers clamping around Luna's wrist like talons.

"Guh... guh..." The old woman's throat produced guttural noises.

Luna scrambled to fetch warm water. It took three basins before Clara looked remotely human again. Luna watched impassively, breaking off a piece of coarse cake and offering it.

Clara snatched it like a starving wolf, her nails sinking deep into Luna's hand.

"Uncle Jack is too cruel!" Luna shook with rage.

Luna's lips curled. "How could he be? Grandma always doted on him the most." She subtly channeled her supernatural ability, her fingertips brushing Clara's wrist for just an instant.

The old woman's eyes flew wide.

"Carry... me... out..." Clara's voice rasped like a rusted saw, yet every word was clear. "I need... to see the mayor..."

Luna stumbled back in shock. Before her eyes, Clara's twisted mouth straightened, her pallid complexion flushing with color.

"Grandma, you can speak?" Luna stared at Luna in disbelief.

Luna cursed inwardly. She'd overdone it—Clara could actually stand now! The old woman shakily pushed herself up, even managing to pull on her pants unaided.

"Quick... fetch the mayor..." Clara's eyes burned with terrifying intensity.

Luna turned and bolted outside. Behind her, a heavy thud echoed—Clara had jumped down from the kang by herself.

This was going to be interesting. A cold smile played on Luna's lips as she ran. Jack White, your reckoning has come.
###Chapter 123: The Will Controversy

Luna supported Grandma Eleanor as they slowly made their way to the front yard. Fiona was squatting in the yard, chopping pig feed with a cleaver. The dull thud-thud of the blade striking the wooden block echoed through the air.

When Fiona looked up, the cleaver slipped from her hand and clattered to the ground.

"G-Grandma?" Her eyes widened, her mouth hanging open in shock.

The doctor had said Grandma Eleanor would never walk again!

Fiona scrambled to her feet, her voice shrill with panic. "Luna! Have you lost your mind? Why did you bring your grandmother out here? If she falls, who’ll take responsibility?" She turned and shouted toward the house, "Jack! Come out here!"

Luna replied calmly, "Grandma wanted to come out. She has something to say."

Jack White pushed aside the curtain and stepped outside. The moment he saw Grandma Eleanor standing in the yard, his face twisted in alarm. He jabbed a finger at Luna. "Nonsense! Your grandmother can’t even speak! First Luna turns rebellious, and now you? Take her back inside—now!"

Slap!

A sharp crack rang through the yard.

Jack clutched his cheek, staring at Grandma Eleanor in disbelief. Her hand remained raised, trembling with fury.

"You ungrateful wretch!" she spat, each word deliberate. "I’m your mother! And this is how you treat me? Leaving me in the back room to rot?"

Jack’s face burned, but what terrified him more was the fact that she could speak again. His eyes darted, and he immediately dropped to his knees.

"Mom, I was wrong—"

Just then, the gate creaked open. Mayor George Clark and the village officials filed in, with Luna bringing up the rear. She quickly darted to Grandma Eleanor’s side.

"What’s going on here?" Mayor George asked, taking in the tense scene. "Let’s get Grandma inside to talk."

Luna and Luna flanked Grandma Eleanor as they helped her into the main house—the very room that had once been hers but had since been taken over by Jack and Fiona. Freshly laundered bedding lay on the kang, carrying the scent of sunshine.

Luna swiftly arranged the bedding, helping Grandma Eleanor settle comfortably against the headboard.

The village officials followed them inside. Beads of sweat formed on Jack’s forehead, and he kicked Fiona. "What are you standing around for? Get some water!"

Fiona caught his meaning and hurried to make sweetened tea. If Grandma Eleanor still acknowledged Jack as her son, there was still room to maneuver.

"Mayor," Grandma Eleanor rasped, her voice hoarse but firm, "I’ve called you here today to witness my will."

The room fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

"My house, my land—if I die of natural causes, they’ll go to Jack. But if my death is anything less than peaceful..." She paused, her clouded eyes sharpening. "Then everything goes to Ethan. Not a single cent to this wretched son of mine!"

"Mother!" Jack collapsed to his knees. "You’re signing my death warrant!"

Grandma Eleanor sneered and slowly rolled up her sleeve.

A horrifying array of bruises and pinches covered her arm—some already purple, others still oozing fresh blood.

Amy Miller, the women’s affairs director, gasped. "What in the world—?"

Every pair of eyes in the room turned toward Jack, their gazes sharp as knives.
###Chapter 124: Shifting Blame

"Jack White, you better explain yourself!" Amy Miller demanded sharply, her authority as the Women's Committee Head in full display. Who would have thought that Jack, known as the most honest man in the village, would mistreat his own mother? Clara White had given everything for this son, and the two had long been held up as a model of filial piety in the village.

The news sent shockwaves through Six Paths Village.

Sweat beaded on Jack's forehead as he scrambled for a way out. He knew full well about Fiona's abuse of the old woman. Ever since his mother became bedridden, he had turned a blind eye. After all, she couldn't speak or move. As long as it didn't kill her, he was content to play dumb.

He'd learned this trick from his mother.

If Clara knew how "filial" her son had been, she'd be sick with regret.

Now that the truth was out, denial was impossible. Elder abuse was a serious crime that could land him in jail. Worse, in a small village, a ruined reputation meant his son would never find a wife.

Jack's eyes darted around before he suddenly turned and slapped Fiona across the face.

"You vile woman! I trusted you to care for my mother, and this is how you treat her?" He kicked her out of the house while cursing.

Paul Jackson quickly intervened, "If you want to fight, do it behind closed doors. Don't make a scene here!" He saw right through Jack—no son could be unaware of his own mother's suffering.

Jack threw himself at the old woman's bedside, weeping dramatically. "Mother, I've failed you! These past days I've been scrambling to pay your medical bills, tending to Maya's illness, and the farmwork couldn't wait..." Snot and tears streamed down his face as he vowed, "I swear I'll stay by your side every day from now on!"

Clara sneered. Did he think she didn't know her own son's true nature? For years she had guarded against this very day, even keeping the land deeds tightly in her grip.

"Enough," the old woman cut him off. "Today, in front of the Mayor, we'll draw up a contract."

George Clark and the others quickly prepared the document, pressing their fingerprints to it.

Before leaving, the Mayor made a point of instructing, "Committee Head Miller, visit the old woman weekly from now on." The message was clear—Jack wasn't to be trusted.

Once everyone had gone, Jack sidled up to his mother. "Mother, please calm down..."

"Move your wife to the shack by the pigpen," Clara said coldly. "And bring me the money from my chest."

Jack paled. "That place isn't fit for living!"

"Oh?" The old woman's gaze turned razor-sharp. "If I could live there, why can't your wife?"

Jack wilted instantly. Under his mother's withering glare, he didn't dare utter another word in Fiona's defense.
###Chapter 125: Family Feud

"Where's my money?" Clara White glared at Jack White, her sharp eyes like daggers.

Jack stole a glance at Luna and Iris standing nearby, cursing inwardly at why these girls hadn't left yet. With outsiders present, his usual tricks to placate his mother wouldn't work.

Clara followed her son's gaze, her expression darkening further. "Why are you looking at them? I asked you a question! That was my life savings—not a single penny less!" She knew her son too well—she could predict his every move.

Luna and Iris stood their ground. Luna smirked inwardly; this drama was her doing, and she wasn't about to miss the show.

Jack wiped the sweat from his brow. "Mom, your hospital bills and medicine cost a fortune. The money's all gone..." His voice trailed off. The family savings had been drained by Maya, and now he was counting on his mother's funds to bail them out.

"All of it?" Clara sneered. She had only been hospitalized for a week, and the nurse had mentioned the bill was barely over two hundred. She had given him six hundred. How dare he try to cheat her!

"Jack, Ethan told me the hospital bill was just over two hundred. Where's the other four hundred? Spit it out!" She slammed her hand on the table. "Or I'll call the mayor and have your whole family thrown out! This house belongs to me and your father!"

Jack panicked. "Mom, we really don't have it! Maya blew through everything, and we were fined a hundred. Ethan’s getting married soon, and we don’t even have the dowry—"

"Enough excuses!" Clara cut him off. "Give me two hundred now. Starting today, you’ll pay me fifteen a month for living under my roof and eating my food!"

Jack’s eyes widened. Fifteen a month? That was a hundred and eighty a year! That would bleed him dry!

"Mom, think of your grandson—"

"My grandson?" Clara scoffed. "Which one of them visited me when I was lying in that shack waiting to die? Listen here—if you don’t pay up, I’ll report you to the commune!"

Jack shot to his feet, fists clenched so tight his knuckles cracked. She was pushing him to the brink!

Clara leaned back leisurely. "Tell your wife I want wheat noodles for lunch, with two poached eggs and extra salt in the broth. I’ve been drinking cornmeal porridge for days—my mouth tastes like dirt!"

Jack gritted his teeth and turned away. He couldn’t afford to move out yet—he had no choice but to endure.

In the yard, he saw his wife, Fanny, sitting on a stool wiping tears. His temper flared. "Didn’t you hear? The old woman wants noodles! Get moving! From now on, you’d better serve her well, or I’ll skin you alive!"

Fanny sprang up, nails raking across his face. "You heartless bastard! I’ve slaved for this family, and you dare raise a hand at me? Go ahead, kill me! See if my brothers don’t tear you apart!"

Jack’s cheek burned. He struck back with a slap. "Then get a divorce! Go tell your brothers how you abused your mother-in-law!"

Fanny instantly deflated. If word got back to her family, she’d never live it down.
###Chapter 126: Calculations

"But... but you agreed to it!" Haofang's voice trembled as she twisted the hem of her shirt between her fingers.

Jack White grabbed her by the collar, his eyes burning with fury. "I agreed? When did I ever agree? Huh? Did I tell you to hit my mother? Or starve her? All I said was she could stay in the back room—what else did I approve? Got proof? Anything in writing or witnesses? Or is it just your word against mine?"

He shoved her away, sending her stumbling back two steps.

"Go ask around—who'd believe you?" Jack narrowed his eyes. "Want me to divorce you right now? Send you back to your parents with nothing but the clothes on your back? The whole village would praise me for being a filial son!"

Haofang's face turned ghostly pale. Her knees buckled, and she dropped to the floor.

"Darling... you can't do this..." She clung to his leg desperately. "We've been married twenty years... our children are grown... I'll listen to you from now on, I swear!" Her voice shook. If she were sent back, her sisters-in-law would make her life hell.

Jack looked down at her coldly. "Fine. Then you move to the back room."

"What?" Her eyes widened.

"Mother's demand." His tone softened slightly. "She's furious right now—let her cool off. Once I've smoothed things over, you can move back." He lowered his voice. "Think about it. If you're kicked out, will Ethan's marriage still happen?"

Haofang bit her lip. Lisa's mother was a snob. If she found out they'd lost their home, she'd call off the engagement immediately.

"...I'll stay in the back room for a few days," she finally relented.

Inside, Luna set a plate of pastries in front of the elderly woman.

Luna had mentioned the divorce, but Clara hadn't invited them to stay for dinner—old habits died hard.

After an awkward silence, the sisters excused themselves, claiming their children needed to eat.

Back home, Luna tied on her apron and started cooking, her brow furrowed.

"Come to the city with me," Luna said as she sorted vegetables. "Bring the kids. There are more opportunities there—we'll find work."

Luna shook her head. "It's unfamiliar... I'd rather stay here, maybe rent some land..."

Luna didn't push. She understood her sister's hesitation—this wasn't a decision to rush.

Just after lunch, Mayor George and his wife arrived.

"Luna, your household registration is settled." George handed her the documents. "There's a sandy plot east of the village—not the best, but it'll do for sweet potatoes or peanuts."

Luna's eyes lit up. "Thank you!"

"Start with this. We'll adjust if better land opens up," Clara reassured her, patting her hand.

The sisters exchanged a smile. It wasn't much, but at least they had a place to begin.
###Chapter 127: Plans (Part 2)

Mayor George Clark pulled out a crumpled stack of bills from his pocket and pressed them into Luna's hands. "The village pooled this together for your school travel expenses. It's not much, but it's from the heart."

Luna's eyes grew moist. Forty-eight dollars felt heavy in her palm.

"Uncle, I'll accept this," she said, gripping the money tightly. "I'll make our village proud!"

"Good girl!" George nodded approvingly. "There's more. The village is applying for poverty relief funds, and I've included your family. It won't be much, but it'll help with food supplies."

Upon hearing this, Luna's sister Maya burst into tears.

"Mayor, how... how can we ever thank you—"

"Silly girl!" Clara Clark pulled Maya into a hug. "Luna's my goddaughter, which makes you my niece. Family doesn't keep score!"

George sighed. "About Ethan's land... well, that's lost to us now. We'll have to help you in other ways."

Warmth spread through Luna's chest. There were still good people in this world.

"Godfather, Godmother, if you ever need anything—"

"None of that!" Clara pretended to scold, producing a red cloth bundle from her bosom. "Your godfather and I saved this—two hundred dollars. You'll need proper supplies for the city."

Luna immediately refused. "Godmother, I have money! Maya can vouch for me!"

Maya nodded vigorously. After much back-and-forth, Clara finally relented.

"Then how about this," Luna said brightly. "I was just worrying about bedding. You're such a good seamstress—you must help me with that!"

Clara finally smiled. "That's more like it!"

With that settled, Luna brought up the pig-rearing plan. George slapped his thigh. "Old Walter's piglets are the best in the east end! I'll take you tomorrow."

At dawn, the trio arrived at the Wallace compound. Its blue-brick buildings and tiled roofs stood out conspicuously in the village.

"Walter!" George called out.

In the courtyard, old Walter and a shirtless man were wrestling a fat hog. Spotting female visitors, the man hastily threw on a jacket.

"Mayor! What brings you here?" Walter wiped his hands and offered cigarettes.

George took a satisfied drag. "These are the White sisters. Want to raise some pigs—make sure you give them your best!"

Walter squinted at the girls. "Dr. White's daughters! Don't worry, I'll take care of you."

Maya nervously twisted her hem. Could they really make this pig business work?
###Chapter 128: Buying Pigs

"Uncle Walter, I only have three hundred dollars. How many pigs do you think I can get with that? My two boys can help gather fodder, but I've never raised pigs before—I'll need your advice." Luna Whitaker twisted the hem of her dress, her voice growing quieter. Her heart pounded. Raising pigs seemed simple, but her parents had once lost an entire litter to swine fever.

Old Walter Wallace puffed on his pipe, eyes narrowed. The Wallace family's pig-rearing skills were renowned in the region—why would he share them so easily?

Seeing this, Luna's sister, Luna White, tugged at her sleeve. "Uncle Walter, we're not asking to learn your trade. We just need help picking two sturdy pigs. My sister's raising three kids alone—she just wants to earn enough to feed them." She deliberately softened her tone on the words "learn your trade."

Old Walter's expression eased. "Ryan, show them the pens." He jerked his chin toward the shirtless young man beside him. "And explain the prices."

The man grunted in acknowledgment and turned away. Luna White noticed with amusement that Ryan's ears had turned faintly pink.

The pigpen was far more impressive than they'd imagined—brick walls, concrete floors, even neatly dug drainage ditches. Just as Luna White marveled at it, she caught Ryan stealing a glance at her sister, nervously twisting his own shirt hem.

"These are the piglets." Ryan pointed to the lively young pigs. "White ones are docile—they'll reach two hundred pounds in five months. Black ones are hardier but wilder." His words grew unexpectedly fluent. "For beginners, five would keep you busy. If you plan long-term, best to keep a boar for breeding..."

Luna Whitaker listened intently, nodding now and then. But worry creased her brow when she thought of their ramshackle pen. "Our place isn't ideal—I'm afraid we'll struggle..."

"It's fine!" Ryan blurted, startling both sisters. Flushing, he added, "I—I can teach you. Ask anytime." Then, quieter: "Dad guards his methods, but neighbors help neighbors."

Luna White raised an eyebrow. Who knew this shy man had such sense?

Back in the yard, Old Walter was chatting with Mayor George Clark. "Decided?" Walter exhaled a smoke ring.

"Five, please." Luna Whitaker pulled out crumpled bills. "A hundred dollars—count it."

Walter waved her off. "Should be a hundred ten, but for your father's sake, we'll call it even." He turned to his son. "Deliver them this afternoon. Show them the ropes."

As they left, Luna White looped arms with her godfather. Only when they were out of earshot did Old Walter mutter, "Since when is George Clark so helpful? Can't even manage his own affairs..."

Ryan, busy herding pigs, didn't look up. "Luna's the first college student from our village."

In the backyard, five piglets squealed. Ryan furtively pulled a paper packet from his pocket—but footsteps made him shove it back.

"Dad? Shouldn't you be napping?"

Old Walter ambled over, hands behind his back. "Couldn't sleep." He squinted at his son. "What're you sneaking around for?"

"N-nothing!" Beads of sweat formed on Ryan's forehead as he loaded the piglets onto the cart. Watching it rumble away, he stomped his foot in frustration—that ancestral digestive tonic never made it into the feed.
###Chapter 129: Blessing of Fortune

George Clark hurried to the village committee office, preoccupied with urgent matters and unable to exchange pleasantries with Luna and the others.

Luna walked arm-in-arm with Luna Whitaker back home when they heard a commotion in the distance. Villagers had gathered in small clusters, craning their necks toward Jack White's house. Aunt Elizabeth Wright happened to pass by and immediately sidled up to them with a hushed tone. "Oh, you're finally back. Your grandmother's chasing your aunt around the yard with a broom, claiming she spat in her food. Tsk tsk..."

Luna and Luna Whitaker exchanged knowing glances. They were all too familiar with Clara White's tormenting ways, and the aunt in question was no pushover either. Jack's household was bound to be chaotic from now on.

The two chose not to involve themselves in the drama—there was still the pigpen waiting to be cleaned at home.

But as they approached their doorstep, the sound of splashing water came from the pigpen. Peering inside, they saw Ethan and Aaron Jackson sweating profusely as they scrubbed the enclosure. Two baskets of fresh pigweed were neatly stacked in the corner, clearly gathered by the boys before dawn.

Luna's heart ached at the sight of their calloused hands—boys their age should be in school. Yet they stubbornly refused, claiming they "weren't cut out for studying." Everyone knew the truth: they couldn't bear to see their mother struggling alone to raise them.

"Sis, look!" Luna Whitaker suddenly tugged her sleeve.

Clara Clark was approaching briskly with Aunt Margaret in tow. The older woman carried a bamboo basket, its lid lifted to reveal a huddle of fluffy yellow chicks, like little balls of animated cotton.

"Luna, pick more hens—they lay eggs well. Keep a few roosters too; you can slaughter them for meat during the holidays," Aunt Margaret advised while deftly selecting twenty-five hens and ten roosters.

Luna Whitaker hastily brought out sugar water as refreshment. Accepting the bowl, Aunt Margaret launched into a detailed lecture on poultry care. "You'll need a bulb for warmth in the first few days, and watch out for rats at night—"

Just then, the creak of a wheelbarrow interrupted her. Ryan Wallace arrived, pushing a cart with five plump piglets snuffling inside their cage.

His eyes immediately landed on the bulb in Luna Whitaker's hand. Without a word, he rolled up his sleeves. "Is the power off? Get me some electrical tape."

Luna watched as Ryan efficiently wired the bulb while Luna Whitaker handed him tools, their movements perfectly synchronized. She couldn't help but smile. Since when had this usually taciturn man become so helpful?

As soon as the light flickered on, the chicks huddled beneath its warmth. Ryan then helped herd the piglets into the pen, pausing before leaving to remind them, "Call me if you need anything. Piglets are the hardest to raise..."

After everyone had left, Luna Whitaker knelt by the basket of chicks, her fingers lightly brushing each one. Unnoticed by others, a faint glow emanated from her fingertips—she was using her supernatural ability to enhance the little creatures' vitality.

Later, the villagers would marvel at how none of Luna Whitaker's chicks died, growing unusually fast. Aunt Margaret boasted to everyone about the quality of her chicks, unaware it was all due to Luna Whitaker's power.

Meanwhile, the five piglets happily rooted in their new trough, completely oblivious to the miracles they were about to bring.
###Chapter 130: An Unexpected Call

"Luna! Come quick—there's a phone call for you at the village office!" A frantic voice shouted from beyond the courtyard wall.

Luna White was crouched in the yard, washing vegetables. She shook the water from her hands and hurried toward the gate. Just yesterday, she and her sister Iris had gone to the market to buy cotton and fabric. Today, they had invited Clara Clark and a few other skilled seamstresses from the village to help make quilts. August was approaching, and in just over a week, Luna would leave for university. She needed to prepare her belongings in advance.

"Coming!" Luna broke into a jog toward the village office.

When she pushed open the door, Mayor George Clark and Security Chief Paul Jackson were huddled together, deep in discussion. The telephone receiver lay crooked on the desk, the line already connected.

"Dad," Luna greeted softly.

Just days ago, Mayor Clark and his wife had hosted a formal ceremony to officially recognize Luna as their goddaughter, with several respected elders from the village as witnesses.

Mayor Clark glanced up and nodded. "It's your brother."

Luna's heart skipped. Her fingers trembled slightly as she picked up the receiver. This was the first time in two lifetimes she had spoken to her brother on the phone. In her past life, Ethan had died a brutal death at the hands of drug traffickers—all because of her. This time, she had sworn to protect him at all costs.

"Ethan..." Her voice cracked.

"Luna!" Ethan's cheerful voice rang through the line. "I just got Uncle Jack's telegram saying Grandma needs five hundred dollars for the hospital. I'm borrowing from my comrades now—I'll send the money as soon as I get my allowance—"

Luna gritted her teeth. That scheming Jack White—how dare he swindle money from her brother!

"Ethan, didn't I send you a telegram?" She remembered clearly—just days ago, she and Iris had gone to town to send it, precisely to prevent him from being deceived.

"I got it, I got it. You said not to send money since you got into university. But this time, Grandma is sick—"

"Grandma was discharged ages ago!" Luna cut him off. "Return every penny you borrowed. The money you've sent home over the years is more than enough for her medical bills."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"Luna… you got into university?" Ethan suddenly exclaimed. "Once you're settled at school, write to me. I'll send you living expenses every month—"

Luna's nose stung. This was her brother—always putting her first.

"Don't send money!" she said quickly. "The university provides financial aid, and the villagers already pooled travel expenses for me. Keep your money—save it for when you get married."

"Hah, you little—" Ethan chuckled. "Fine, I'll listen to you. I'll take leave during the New Year to visit."

After hanging up, Ethan frowned. Something about Luna's tone felt off—like she was holding back some grievance. He decided to request leave early and go home to check on her.

"Captain!" He strode toward the office. "I need to request leave—"

Meanwhile, Luna had no idea her brother was already planning a surprise for her.

Just as she set the receiver down, the village office door burst open.

"Mayor! Trouble!" A villager rushed in, panting. "There's a fight!"

Mayor Clark shot to his feet. "Who's fighting who?"


###Chapter 131: Karma Strikes

"Harold Martin is getting beaten up by a man who came in a car!" The messenger gasped for breath, his face alight with excitement. "They say he got some man's niece pregnant and was fooling around with other female workers in the factory. He got caught red-handed. The two women fought, and the baby was lost. Now they're pressing charges against him for indecent assault!"

Mayor George Clark slowly took his seat. "Noted. Let's continue the meeting."

The messenger froze.

This wasn't right!

Usually, no matter how wrong a villager was, the mayor would rally people to back them up. Why was he so indifferent to Harold Martin today?

"Mayor, aren't you going to check? That man is hitting him hard—Harold's head is bleeding! His parents don't dare step in, and the man brought four or five helpers. There's even someone in a police uniform there!"

George waved his hand. "We're not in the right here. Going would be pointless. Besides, if they brought the police, they must be following proper procedure. What would people think if we showed up to support a sex offender?"

He scanned the room. "Anyone here want to help a criminal? You might get accused of harboring him, and then no one would believe you even if you had a good reason."

Everyone shook their heads.

"Exactly!" George rapped the table. "With the police there, do you really think they'd let things go too far? At most, the girl's family just wants to vent. We have more important matters to discuss—like the agricultural tax."

Luna White suppressed a smile. "Godfather, I'll take my leave."

George waved her off. Luna clearly saw the corners of his lips twitch upward.

This was almost certainly George's doing.

Harold wasn't stupid enough to offend the factory manager. It seemed George had been quietly plotting something big these past few days. After the way the Martin family had bullied Lily, if George didn't teach them a lesson, he wouldn't deserve his position as mayor.

As soon as Luna stepped out of the village committee office, Lily grabbed her arm.

"Finally! I've been waiting forever!" Lily's eyes sparkled with excitement.

"I need to go cook. The aunties are still at my place making quilts," Luna said, pretending to leave.

Lily held her tight. "What's the hurry? After we watch the show, I'll help you." Without waiting for a reply, she dragged Luna to the Martin family's doorstep.

In the yard, four or five burly men were kicking and punching Harold, who curled into a ball on the ground, groaning as he covered his head. Mrs. Martin tried to intervene but was shoved to the ground, immediately wailing, "Murder! Help!"

The onlookers pointed and whispered, but no one stepped forward.

Luna noticed a uniformed officer sitting nearby, taking statements from villagers.

Mrs. Martin scrambled up and rushed toward the messenger. "Where's the mayor? Where's the security chief? My son's being beaten to death!"

The neighbor shook his head. "The mayor said this is official business—the village committee can't interfere. Besides, who would dare get involved with a sex offender?"

Mrs. Martin collapsed to the ground, cursing, "George Clark, you heartless bastard! This is revenge! I curse your daughter to never marry and die an old maid!"

Lily trembled with rage and moved to charge forward.

Luna yanked her back.

If Lily stepped in now, she'd be playing right into Mrs. Martin's hands. If anyone was going to fight, it should be her—the goddaughter!

Luna rolled up her sleeves and strode into the yard.
###Chapter 132: Overwhelming Beatdown

Luna White had just rushed toward Mrs. Martin when a sudden whoosh of wind cut through the air.

Clara Clark charged forward like a whirlwind, grabbing Mrs. Martin by the hair and slamming her to the ground before pinning her down. The sharp, crisp sound of slaps rang out—each strike so forceful it sounded like pounding mochi. Luna instinctively took two steps back. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to help, but there was simply no opening for her to intervene.

Mrs. Martin’s face was already a mess, blood smeared across her nose and cheeks. She might have been skilled at making scenes in the village, but when it came to actual combat, she was no match for Clara.

Everyone in the village knew Clara was a capable woman, but few remembered she had once been honored as the county’s top female militia member—someone who had trained with rifles and bayonets.

Luna watched, stunned. Even ten Mrs. Martins tied together wouldn’t stand a chance against this kind of firepower.

"Shut your filthy mouth!" Clara snarled between strikes. "Daring to curse my family? Let the whole village hear how this old hag insulted my husband and daughter! If I don’t knock her teeth out, she’ll think the Clark family is easy to bully!"

Mrs. Martin tried to fight back, but her arms were immediately pinned again. Only now did she realize her mistake—she had just humiliated herself in front of the entire village while thoroughly offending the mayor’s family. Who would dare help her son now?

"Aiyo, she’s killing me—" Mrs. Martin wailed, only to be cut off by another brutal slap.

That finally silenced her. Her cheeks swelled grotesquely, burning with pain.

She had learned the hard way—her usual shrewish tactics only worked on those who cared about face. Against someone like Clara, throwing a tantrum was just asking for a beating.

Seeing Mrs. Martin’s disheveled, pitiful state, Luna quickly signaled to the nearby aunties. There was no way her slight frame could pull Clara away in this state.

Several women rushed forward, some wrapping their arms around Clara’s waist, others pulling at her arms, finally managing to drag her off.

Mrs. Martin, still sniffling, opened her mouth to wail again—until Luna suddenly shouted, "Hold my godmother back!"

The words died in Mrs. Martin’s throat, choking her until her eyes rolled.

"One more word, and I’ll rip your mouth apart!" Clara jabbed a finger at her, still seething.

Lily Clark quickly pulled her mother back, her heart swelling with warmth and guilt. For her sake, her usually dignified mother had lost her temper in public.

Finally, the police officer stepped in to mediate. "Enough! If you have something to say, say it properly. What kind of example is this? If someone gets seriously hurt, you’ll be paying medical bills!" His words nearly drew laughter from the crowd.

A middle-aged man stepped forward. "This bastard got my niece pregnant and then ran around with other women! I’ve got hospital records—I’m pressing charges for indecency!"

The moment Harold Martin heard "jail time," he threw himself at the man’s feet. "Uncle, I was wrong! I’ll marry Xiaozhen, I swear I’ll treat her right—"

"Get lost!" The man kicked him away. "My family’s daughter doesn’t need your concern!"

The officer yanked Harold up. "Come with me to the station."

Harold’s legs gave out, and he crumpled to the ground. Mrs. Martin lunged forward to stop them, but the officer glared. "Interfere with official duties, and I’ll arrest you too!"

She immediately shrank back. Her usual hysterics wouldn’t work on the police.

And just like that, Harold was dragged away. The villagers whispered and pointed, all agreeing—he’d gotten exactly what he deserved.
###Chapter 133: Thoughts

Clara Clark hummed a cheerful tune as she walked home with Lily and Luna White. The satisfaction of finally getting revenge was written all over her face, her grin impossible to hide.

"Mom, slow down," Lily said, eyeing her mother's triumphant expression with mild concern.

"Slow down? Not today!" Clara swung her arms energetically. "Those two old fools from the Baker family had it coming!"

Luna suppressed a smile but stayed silent. She knew how long Clara had been holding in her anger, and seeing her finally confront the Bakers was undeniably satisfying.

In the kitchen, Luna swiftly chopped vegetables while Lily crouched by the stove, feeding the fire with occasional sighs.

"What's wrong?" Luna asked without looking up.

"I just... feel guilty about Mom," Lily muttered. "If only I hadn't been so blind back then..."

Luna paused mid-chop. "Regretting it now?"

"How could I not?" Lily's eyes reddened. "Did you see how happy she was today? All because of me..."

"Enough!" Luna slammed the knife onto the cutting board. "Stop crying. Your mom just wants what's best for you. If you really feel bad, then live well from now on."

Lily wiped her face. "I just... don’t know what to do next."

Luna arranged the chopped vegetables neatly. "Not going back to school?"

"School?" Lily gave a bitter laugh. "I barely scraped by with a middle school diploma. What’s the point?"

"So what then? Getting married?" Luna teased.

"Luna!" Lily stomped her foot in frustration. "Who would want me like this?"

Luna poured oil into the wok, and the moment the scallions hit the heat, a rich aroma filled the air.

"Maybe... I could go with you to the city?" Lily suddenly suggested.

Luna nearly dropped the spatula. "Are you crazy? Do you think your parents would agree?"

"I..." Lily bit her lip. "I just don’t want to stay here. The way people in the village look at me..."

Luna sighed. "You think the city will be any easier?"

Outside, Luna's sister called everyone to wash up for dinner. Luna quickly dropped the noodles into the boiling water, letting the subject drop.

"Food's ready!" Lily carried the bowls out, her smile back in place.

Clara's eyes lit up at the sight of the steaming noodles with savory minced pork. "Oh my, Luna! Your cooking could rival a professional chef!"

The two neighbor ladies nodded in agreement. Luna’s sister passed out chopsticks with a smile. "Don’t be shy—eat while it's hot."

On the doorstep, Ethan and Aaron Jackson hunched over their bowls, devouring the meal without looking up.

"Bro, this is amazing," Aaron whispered.

Ethan nodded and ladled himself more broth. Watching the happy family inside, warmth spread through his chest.

This was what home was supposed to feel like.
###Chapter 134: Disaster Strikes

Old Mrs. Harris scattered corn kernels into the chicken feeder, muttering under her breath, "The Whites are pressing hard for the wedding. We need to hurry with the preparations. I've got enough for the dowry, but the appliances, gold jewelry, new clothes..." She counted on her fingers, her frown deepening.

Old Mr. Harris squatted on the doorstep, puffing on his pipe, the embers flickering in the bowl.

"If we can't manage, we'll have to go to town and find our second son," he said, exhaling a cloud of smoke. "Frank's getting married—his uncle can't just stand by and do nothing."

Mrs. Harris set the empty basket down with a thud. "That ungrateful wretch! How long has it been since he last came home? Doesn’t he care about our struggles?" Her voice rose with anger. "Who are we doing all this for? For him! Won’t Frank have to take care of him in his old age? If he doesn’t treat Frank well now, who will?"

"Enough of that!" Mr. Harris rapped his pipe sharply against the step. "All these years, hasn’t he built us a house and bought land? Frank’s his nephew, not his son!"

Before Mrs. Harris could retort, the courtyard gate crashed open.

"Quick, help!" Yang Mei rushed in with four or five strong young men, carrying a figure wrapped in a quilt. Mrs. Harris took one look and nearly collapsed—it was Fang Jianping!

"Take him inside!" Yang Mei directed them toward the west room. But when they lifted the door curtain, they found Frank sprawled across the kang, snoring loudly.

Mrs. Harris panicked. "This—this room is for Frank’s wedding—"

"There’s no time for that!" Yang Mei’s eyes were red-rimmed. "Let’s put Jianping in your room for now."

Once they settled Fang Jianping onto the kang in the main room, Mrs. Harris finally got a clear look at her son—sunken cheeks, pale lips, his whole body gaunt and wasted.

"Mother..." Fang Jianping’s voice was barely a whisper. "Loan sharks came demanding payment... said Frank owes two thousand... they smashed up the shop... my back..." He broke into violent coughing before he could finish.

Mr. Harris shot to his feet. "Drag that little bastard here right now!"

Mrs. Harris blocked him desperately. "What good will that do? Can he magically produce money?" She turned back to tuck the quilt around Fang Jianping. "Son, I’ll make you some ginseng soup..."

Fang Jianping closed his eyes, his heart sinking. He had planned to feign illness to test his family’s reaction, but then real loan sharks had shown up. The thugs had been ruthless, shattering glass counters, and though he’d taken a few blows to the back, he was far from incapacitated.

That night, after discussing it with Yang Mei, he decided to play along. But seeing his mother’s blatant favoritism, a heavy weight settled in his chest.

If Frank were his own son... Fang Jianping clenched the quilt, his nails digging into his palms. He’d have broken the little bastard’s legs by now!
###Chapter 135: Vacating the Room

Thwack! The old man slammed his long-stemmed pipe against the doorframe, sending sparks flying. "Are you determined to tear this family apart? Look what you've done to our second son!" His beard quivered with rage.

The old woman shrank back, not daring to argue with the head of the household. She muttered under her breath, "Our second son hasn't even complained. Why are you so worked up?"

Maya pushed aside the curtain and stepped inside, her eyes red-rimmed.

"Father, Mother, the business failed. We're drowning in debt. After liquidating the shop in town, we have nothing left." She wiped her tears. "The doctor says Frank needs proper rest to recover. We've decided to come back and farm—at least we won't starve."

The old man nodded. "It's good you're back. This family won't let you go hungry." After all, blood was thicker than water. He couldn't turn away his own son.

Maya glanced toward the west room. "It's already noon. Why is Frank still asleep? We need to start cleaning—we'll be staying here from now on." That was the house they had paid to build. Why should Frank Harris get to keep it?

The old woman's expression darkened. "Well... Frank is getting married soon. Since you were living in town, the room was just sitting empty..."

"Mother!" Maya's voice rose sharply. "We paid for that house! It was agreed those two rooms were ours! Where are we supposed to live now?"

"This house is big enough. Can't you find a spot?" The old woman scoffed. "Why not take Frank's old room? Why fuss over such things with family?"

Maya trembled with anger. "If it doesn't matter, then why don't you ask my elder brother and his wife to move to the smaller room? We'll take theirs!"

"How dare you!" The old woman slapped her thigh. "A useless hen like you dares talk back? If not for Frank stopping me, I'd have sent you back to your parents long ago! Frank will take care of you in your old age—what's wrong with him using your room?"

The words stabbed Maya like a knife. She clenched her fists, ready to explode—

"Mother." Frank suddenly opened his eyes. "Am I still your son?" His voice was weak but firm. "The deed clearly states that house is mine. Can you really live with yourself, doing this?"

Maya quickly pressed a hand to her husband's arm, afraid he might reveal too much.

The old woman faltered. She could throw a fit with her daughter-in-law, but her own son...

"Frank, I didn't mean it like that..."

"Good." Frank gave a bitter smile. "For a moment, I thought you only cared about grandsons, not sons."

The old man cleared his throat loudly. "Woman, go wake Frank up! Tell him to clear out the room and carry his uncle there himself!" He had already calculated—Frank would need his uncle's help for the wedding. Besides, since when did uncles make way for nephews?

This would also show Frank how important it was to have a son.
###Chapter 136 The Old Woman's Scheme

Frank Harris was snoring thunderously, dead to the world. He had spent the previous night gambling with his no-good friends and only stumbled home at dawn. To him, the day didn’t start until the sun went down.

A sharp smack jolted him as the old woman slapped his back. "Frank, wake up!"

He rolled over and yanked the blanket over his head. In his dream, Maya White’s soft, pale body was smiling at him, making him drool.

"Your uncle’s back!" the old woman hissed in his ear.

That pierced through Frank’s drowsiness like a needle. He had lost every penny last night and was desperate for cash. His uncle, who ran a small shop in town, had always been his fattest wallet.

"Did Uncle bring the dowry?" Frank bolted upright, eyes gleaming. He knew his parents were useless, but his uncle had always been generous.

The old woman’s face darkened. She had just been scolded by her son and was seething. Something was off about him this time—his words were sharp, no doubt poisoned by that useless wife of his who couldn’t even bear a son.

"Clean up this mess. Your uncle’s moving back in," she spat through gritted teeth. "The loan sharks wrecked his shop!"

"What?" Frank jerked upright.

She smacked him again, though this time it was barely a tap. "It’s all your fault! Those two thousand you borrowed last month? The interest ballooned. They came for him when he couldn’t pay. The doctors say he might never walk again!"

Frank’s face drained of color. He remembered now—the gambling debt in the neighboring village had spiraled into an impossible sum. If the loan sharks came for him next…

"Uncle didn’t pay it off for me?" His voice cracked.

"Pay it off? Ha!" The old woman stomped her foot. "Now they’re hounding him every day, and he’s bedridden!"

In the next room, Jack White listened, his heart sinking. Luna had been right—this nephew was nothing but a leech.

"What do we do?" Frank panicked. "They’ll kill me!"

The old woman lowered her voice. "Your uncle’s had that shop for years. He must have savings. Wait on him hand and foot these next few days. Get on his good side, and the money will—"

Frank’s eyes lit up, then dimmed. "But this room was for my wedding!"

"Idiot!" She jabbed his forehead. "Once you get the money, you can live wherever you want!"

Grudgingly, Frank dragged himself out of bed and plastered on a smile as he headed next door. "Uncle, Auntie, let me help!"

Mary White watched the act coldly, seeing right through them. She silently cleaned the wrecked bridal suite—cigarette butts, spit stains, moldy dishes. This was the "home" she had married into over twenty years ago.

Outside, the old woman’s exaggerated laughter rang out. Mary clenched the rag in her hand. If Jack still refused to see the truth this time, she would take her daughters and leave this hellhole for good. Luna was right—daughters could carry on the family name too. Why should they be stepping stones for a gambler?
###Chapter 137: Blood for Blood

Yang Mei had just finished tidying up the house when the courtyard gate was kicked open with a loud bang. Seven or eight rough-looking men barged in, led by the bald-headed thug who had come to collect debts last time.

"Where's Frank Harris? Get your ass out here!" The bald man kicked over a bucket of water in the yard, sending it splashing across the ground. It was the clean water Yang Mei had just fetched to wash the bedding.

"Hey, nice quilt." A yellow-haired lackey yanked the cotton quilt off the clothesline and deliberately tossed it into a muddy puddle. Yang Mei's heart ached—it was made with five pounds of fresh cotton, a wedding gift from her parents.

Frank Harris heard the commotion and lifted the curtain, paling instantly at the sight of the intruders. His legs gave way, and he dropped to his knees beside Jianping's bed.

"Uncle! Save me!" He clutched Jianping's hand so tightly his nails dug into the flesh. "They'll kill me this time... They nearly did last time... Uncle, please..."

Before he could finish, the bald man and his gang stormed inside. Spotting Jianping on the bed, they burst into mocking laughter.

"Frank Harris, the IOU says twenty-one hundred. If you don't pay up today..." The bald man grinned viciously before suddenly kicking Frank square in the chest. "I'll take one of your legs!"

Frank was knocked flat on his back, still gripping Jianping's hand. Yang Mei lunged forward to steady her husband, preventing him from tumbling off the bed.

"Ouch... my back..." Jianping groaned dramatically, shooting Yang Mei a subtle wink.

Yang Mei nearly laughed. This old fox—still putting on an act at a time like this.

"Frank Harris!" The bald man plopped onto a chair like a king holding court. "With interest, it's twenty-three hundred now. No money today, and your whole family's gonna suffer!"

The old woman rushed to shield her grandson. "If you want money, just ask! What's the point of beating people?"

"Oh, granny's got money?" The bald man rubbed his shiny scalp. "Even better. Boys, get granny some tea!"

The old man forced a smile. "This... Brother Bald, right? Can you give us a few more days..."

"More days?" The bald man glared. "You think I'm running a charity? No money today, you lose an arm!"

Jianping's brother and sister-in-law finally scurried in, flustered. Yao Pandi wailed at the sight of her son. "Father, he's our only heir..."

The old man sighed. "Second Son, how much... can you spare?"

Before Jianping could speak, Yang Mei cut in. "How much are Big Brother and Sister-in-law chipping in? You can't expect us to cover it all."

Jianping's brother immediately played poor. "Sister-in-law, we're just farmers. Where would we get money?"

"Since when do they have money?" the old woman shrilled. "If you've got it, just hand it over! Since when do family members keep such close accounts?"

Yang Mei smirked coldly. "If we had money, would they have beaten Jianping half to death last time? All these years, who paid for the house, the food? Frank keeps borrowing from us—our little shop's been drained dry. Now the business is ruined, we owe suppliers and rent, and the last five hundred is for Jianping's medicine..."

Jianping reached to stop her but withdrew his hand halfway. He wanted to see—without him, would this family even survive?
###Chapter 138: Total Loss

Frank Harris hid inside, pretending not to hear the commotion—until news of his brother's failed business reached him. Panicked, he rushed out. He had only wanted to avoid trouble, never expecting such devastating news.

"Brother, you must be joking!" Frank's voice cracked. "Sister-in-law, if you don’t want to pay, just treat it as a loan. Frank is the only heir to our family!"

The old woman exploded at his words. She grabbed Frank's collar, her nails digging into his skin. "You heartless wretch! If anything happens to Frank, who’s going to carry your funeral urn?"

The loan sharks burst into laughter.

"Well, well, what a show today," the leader sneered, cigarette dangling from his lips. "Even we debt collectors have some shame. But you lot? Eating someone else’s food, drinking their wine, and still demanding money with a straight face?"

Frank’s face burned with humiliation. He wished the ground would swallow him whole.

The old man shot his wife a glare before forcing a smile at the loan shark. "Sir, we’ll gather the money. Right now."

"Dad!" Frank stomped his foot in desperation. "Where am I supposed to get that kind of cash?"

Ignoring him, the old man declared, "Your mother and I will put in five hundred. The eldest covers twelve hundred, and the second brother makes up the remaining three hundred."

"Still short a hundred," the loan shark reminded with narrowed eyes.

The old woman jumped up. "No! Those two pigs in the pen—I raised them myself!"

"Then keep them," the loan shark shrugged. "We only take cash."

Little Frank trembled behind his grandmother, tears and snot smeared across his face.

"We’ll pay the rest," Frank suddenly spoke up.

Maya nearly fainted from rage. She dug her nails into her husband’s arm, drawing blood. This idiot! Can’t he see they’re putting on an act?

Finally, the money was gathered. The loan shark took the thick stack of bills, flicked through it with satisfaction, and tossed the IOU into the brazier.

In the flickering firelight, the family’s expressions darkened. The old woman wailed as she clutched her grandson. Frank crouched in the corner, counting the leftover change. The old man stared blankly at the burning debt note.

Only Maya noticed the loan shark’s meaningful glance at Little Frank before leaving.

As the gate slammed shut, Maya’s heart sank. She knew—this wasn’t over.
###Chapter 139: The Fallout

The moment Officer Guang left, Frank Harris' legs gave way, and he collapsed onto the floor, sweat pouring down his forehead. Before he could catch his breath, the old woman grabbed his ear and yanked him up with brute force.

"Frank Harris! You good-for-nothing!" The old woman trembled with rage. "Two thousand one hundred dollars! You've drained the family dry! We were about to arrange a marriage for you—what are we supposed to use for the dowry now? Are you trying to kill us?"

"Ow! Grandma, ease up!" Frank winced in pain, finally prying her fingers off. "I'm your own grandson! Who's gonna give you great-grandkids if you break me?"

Rubbing his reddened ear, he still felt hard done by.

John Harris and his wife stood nearby, their faces dark with fury. Their son was useless, but this mess was all his uncle’s fault! If he’d saved more money over the years, they wouldn’t have had to cough up this sum—money meant for Frank’s wedding!

"You dare talk back?" The old man slammed the table. "Keep this up, and see who’ll bother with you!"

Frank’s eyes darted craftily as he sidled up to his uncle. "Uncle, when are you and Aunt going back to town to reopen the shop? I can take you there. The sooner you start, the sooner you’ll earn money."

The moment Maya heard this, she pushed her husband back onto the bed. "Reopen what? The doctor said if his back doesn’t heal properly, he’ll be paralyzed for life! Are you trying to kill him?"

Jack sighed. "Frank, with my condition... I might have to rely on you from now on."

"What? No way!" Frank jumped up in panic. "How will we make money without the shop? If you come back to farm, what’ll that measly harvest even cover?"

Maya sneered. "Oh, so farming means we’ll starve? Your parents farmed their whole lives—did they die from it?"

"That’s different!" Frank snapped, his face flushing. "Farming earns peanuts! Uncle’s sick, so why can’t you run the shop?"

"Run the shop?" Maya’s hands shook with anger. "Rent, stock—everything costs money! We’ve got a hundred dollars left for medical bills! Why don’t you front the capital?"

Frank stiffened. "Why should I? You’ve been in town for years—surely you’ve saved something! Listen, if you don’t reopen that shop, don’t expect me to take care of you in your old age!"

Thud! Jack suddenly struck the bedframe, his face turning ashen.

Maya’s eyes reddened as she lashed out. "All these years—the house, food, your grandparents’ living expenses—who paid for it all? You took two or three hundred a month for pocket money! And now, with your uncle bedridden, you’re still squeezing us for money?"

The old woman opened her mouth to curse, but Jack’s icy glare silenced her.

"Fine, I’ll say it straight!" Frank planted his hands on his hips. "No son to carry your coffin? Let the whole village laugh at you! Or maybe your precious daughter can smash the mourning bowl for you!"

"You little—!" The old man snatched a broom, ready to strike. "Apologize to your uncle!"

Jack raised a hand, his voice hoarse. "Mom, Dad, you heard him. A 'son' like this—we don’t want him. Brother, keep your treasure to yourself."

He clasped Maya’s hand and spoke slowly, deliberately. "From today onward, if anyone brings up inheriting both family lines again—don’t blame me for cutting ties."
###Chapter 140: Awakening

"Fine, Uncle! You said it yourself! Don't come crying to me if you're sick or starving—I won't lift a finger. From now on, our families are done!" Frank Harris squared his shoulders, his expression defiant.

In his mind, his grandparents had always told him he was the only heir to the Harris name. What did his uncle's three daughters matter? Married women were like spilled water—useless. Who else would take care of his uncle in old age if not him?

Hadn't he spent his uncle's money without a shred of guilt all these years, banking on that very belief? In the village, wasn't it always the sons who inherited? Who else would his uncle's savings go to? Those three worthless girls?

"Good! Very good! Even if I die with no one to bury me, I'll never beg you for help, Frank!" Fang Jianping trembled with rage, his words final.

The old woman wrung her hands in distress. "Son, Frank just speaks without thinking. You're the elder—"

"Grandma!" Frank sneered. "It's Uncle who's disowning me! Let's see what golden crops he can grow when he's bedridden!"

Fang Jiansheng slapped him across the face. "You wretched boy! How dare you speak to your uncle like that?"

"Go ahead! Beat me to death and see who buries you!" Frank jutted his chin out. "I'm your son, not his!" With that, he stormed into his room and threw himself onto the bed, pulling the covers over his head.

The house fell into an eerie silence.

Fang Jiansheng and his wife stood awkwardly. Deep down, they agreed with their son—their brother was barely fifty and already needed care. Who could handle decades of that?

Maya helped Fang Jianping to his feet while the old woman fretted. "Don't move him! Are you just going to stand there? Help him!"

The five of them scrambled to carry Fang Jianping to the next room. Fang Jiansheng's heart sank as he watched his brother lie motionless—this illness might be permanent.

"Rest well, brother..." Fang Jiansheng muttered hollowly.

Fang Jianping shook his head. "Don't bother."

Once everyone had left, Fang Jianping collapsed onto the bed, sobbing uncontrollably. This illness had been a mirror, revealing the truth. All these years, he'd treated his nephew like a son, skimping on his own daughters' dowries just to save money for the boy...

"Stop crying!" Maya patted his back. "Better to see the truth now than later."

Fang Jianping wiped his face. "I was wrong, Maya... From now on, we'll rely on our daughters."

"Took you long enough." Maya squeezed his hand. "Who carried you to the hospital last time you had a fever? Our eldest! What's wrong with daughters? They're worth ten of that ungrateful wretch!"

Fang Jianping nodded firmly, his eyes finally clear.
###Chapter 141: Moving Out

Frank Harris had been bedridden for seven straight days.

The old man's hands trembled as he carried the medicine bowl into the room. The figure on the bed looked deathly pale, his breathing so faint it was almost inaudible.

"Son..." The old man's voice cracked.

Outside the door, the old woman wiped her tears. She knew in her heart—this time, her son might not make it.

"Mom, what about Frank's wedding?" Frank's brother, John Harris, rubbed his hands nervously as he approached.

The old woman glared at him. "How dare you ask? If it weren't for you—"

"Grandma!" Frank's son, young Frank, burst into the room. "Maya's family is demanding the dowry! They said they'll call off the engagement if we don't pay up!"

The old man slammed the medicine bowl onto the table. "Let them call it off!"

"Dad!"

"Grandpa!"

Father and son protested in unison.

The old woman slapped her thigh. "Enough! We'll sell the pigs tomorrow to gather the dowry money!"

Young Frank stomped his foot in frustration. "What about the appliances? I can't go empty-handed!"

John's eyes gleamed with a sudden idea. "Frank's room has—"

"Shut your mouth!" The old man grabbed a broom and swung it at him. "You heartless wretch! Your brother is on his deathbed, and you're still eyeing his belongings!"

John ducked and scurried away. Seeing this, young Frank dropped to his knees before his grandmother. "Grandma, you love me the most. Uncle's room—"

The old woman shuddered.

Late that night, when the house was silent, she crept into Frank's room.

"Son..." Her voice was weak. "I need to discuss something with you..."

Suddenly, the man on the bed coughed violently, spitting blood onto his pillow.

The old woman stumbled back in fright.

"Mother..." Frank's voice was barely a whisper. "I... won't make it..."

Tears streamed down the old woman's face.

"Move me... out of here..." Frank gave a bitter smile. "Don't... let me... delay... young Frank..."

Her legs gave way, and she collapsed to her knees beside the bed.
###Chapter 142: Heartbreak

Frank Harris lay on the bed, his fingers absently tracing the edge of the quilt. It had been eight days since he'd been confined to bed, and his entire body ached as if his bones had come apart. A hardworking man all his life, this was the first time he'd ever been forced to lie idle.

"Frank, time for your medicine," Maya Harris said, stepping into the room with a bowl of dark brown liquid, her brow furrowed.

Frank took the bowl and downed the bitter concoction in one gulp. The bitterness on his tongue was nothing compared to the bitterness in his heart. He had already made plans—once he recovered, he would take Maya to town and reopen their shop. The money they'd saved over the years would be enough to buy a small courtyard home, with a shop in front and living quarters in the back. They could make a life there.

"What about... Frank Jr. and..." Frank's words trailed off before he could finish.

Maya set the bowl down heavily on the table. "Still thinking about that ungrateful brat?"

Just then, footsteps sounded outside. The elderly woman shuffled in with her cane, her sharp eyes scanning the room.

"Frank, feeling any better?" she asked, her tone uncharacteristically soft.

Maya tensed immediately, discreetly tugging at Frank's sleeve.

"Mom, this illness..." Frank coughed weakly. "I don't think I'll recover anytime soon."

The old woman sat on the edge of the bed and sighed. "Frank Jr. is getting married soon. There'll be a lot of people coming and going in the house. Your room reeks of medicine—why don't you go stay with Daisy for a few days?"

Frank bolted upright, wincing as pain shot through his injuries. "Mom, are you kicking me out?"

"Nonsense!" The old woman's face hardened. "I'm thinking of you. What can you do for the village in your condition? At least at Daisy's place, someone can take care of you."

Maya let out a cold laugh. "Mom, you're just afraid we'll be a burden, aren't you?"

The old woman's expression darkened. "Frank, let me be blunt. You're in no state to support us in our old age. Consider the house as payment for your filial duty. Didn't Daisy's husband say he'd take care of you?"

Frank felt as if a bucket of ice water had been dumped over his head. "Mom, I'm your own son!"

"Exactly why I'm doing this for your own good!" The old woman slapped the edge of the bed. "Do you want to keep fighting with Frank Jr. every day?"

Maya suddenly stood up. "Fine, we'll leave. But we're drawing up a contract, with the mayor as witness."

The old woman hadn't expected her daughter-in-law to agree so readily and was momentarily stunned.

That afternoon, the mayor arrived with several elders. The agreement was clear in black and white: the two rooms would serve as repayment for their filial obligation, and neither party owed the other anything from that day forward.

Frank's hand trembled as he pressed his fingerprint onto the paper, tears splashing onto the document and smudging the ink.

"Dad!" A voice called from outside the courtyard. Daisy rushed in, her eyes red, followed by her husband, Charles.

Maya had secretly called their daughter earlier. Watching them busily pack their belongings, Frank finally broke down, tears streaming down his weathered face.

"Let's go," he said, casting one last look at the courtyard where he'd spent most of his life. "I'm never coming back."

Charles helped his father-in-law onto the tractor. As the engine roared to life, Frank stared at the village growing smaller in the distance, feeling as if a piece of his heart had been torn out.

Maya gripped his hand tightly. "We'll... start over."

The tractor kicked up a cloud of dust as it carried the couple toward an uncertain future.
###Chapter 143: The First Hurdle

Frank Harris lounged in his new house, legs crossed and a grin stretching ear to ear. The place was finally his! Sneaking two ten-dollar bills from Jack White’s drawer when no one was looking, he whistled a tune as he sauntered toward the gambling den. The wedding arrangements could be left to his family—he couldn’t be bothered.

Meanwhile, Luna White was busy packing. She’d be leaving for school in a week, with only ten days left to spend with her sister. But just as dawn broke, Ethan Jackson burst into the room in a panic. "Mom! Aunt Luna! The pigs—something’s wrong with the pigs!"

Luna Whitaker barely had time to slip on her cloth shoes before rushing to the pigpen, Luna White close behind.

The sight that greeted them was devastating. Five piglets lay sprawled on the ground, their weak whimpers barely audible. Luna’s legs nearly gave out—these were the family’s prized possessions, bought after half a year of scrimping and saving.

"Luna, what do we do...?" Luna Whitaker’s voice trembled. If they lost this hundred-dollar investment, how would they survive?

Luna pressed her lips together. She could easily use her supernatural ability to save the pigs, but she couldn’t be her sister’s free veterinarian forever. Raising livestock came with risks, and Luna Whitaker needed to face them herself.

"Sis, go get Ryan Wallace!" Luna said decisively.

Luna Whitaker snapped out of her daze and sprinted toward the Wallace household. Luna sighed as she watched her sister’s retreating figure. Livestock farming was no easy task. As the saying went, "Even a fortune can vanish with livestock." One misstep could mean total loss. But right now, her sister wouldn’t hear any of it.

Ryan arrived quickly. The moment he stepped into the pigpen, his brow furrowed. He crouched, checking the piglets’ eyes and prying open their mouths.

"Let’s try some medicine first," he said, pulling a paper packet from his pocket. "If they recover by morning, they’ll make it." His gaze swept the barren pen. "I told you to keep straw bedding in here."

Luna Whitaker’s tears spilled over. "It’s my fault... I thought it was dirty, so I cleared it all out..."

Ryan shook his head. This wasn’t work meant for women. Before he could speak, Ethan stepped forward. "Uncle, teach me!" The sixteen-year-old stood tall.

"Nonsense!" Luna Whitaker wiped her tears. "I’ll do it!"

With a sigh, Ryan rolled up his sleeves and demonstrated how to pry open a piglet’s mouth to administer medicine. Luna Whitaker paid close attention, but her fingers still got nicked by the pigs’ teeth.

After Ryan left, the family was subdued. Luna Whitaker kept checking the pigpen, her heart heavy as she watched the listless piglets. Just days ago, she’d been brimming with ambition—now, the future seemed bleak.

At dusk, Ryan returned. This time, he guided Luna Whitaker’s hands, teaching her how to dose the pigs properly. By the time they finished, both were drenched in sweat.

That night, Luna Whitaker tossed and turned. At first light, she raced to the pigpen—only to find the five piglets scrambling for food, lively as ever. Her legs buckled, and she collapsed to the ground, laughing through her tears.

They’d made it over the first hurdle.
###Chapter 144: Mooching a Meal

Luna Whitaker rushed back from the front yard, her face glowing with excitement. "Luna, the pigs have all recovered! Old Walter's family remedy really works. Those half-dead hogs from yesterday are fighting over feed this morning!" She rolled up her sleeves to help set the table, radiating energy.

Maya handed her a bowl of cornmeal porridge, frowning slightly. "Sis, the Wallaces do know their pigs. But have you considered this is just the beginning? Hog farming is risky. Why not come to the city with me? With the boys around, setting up a stall would be safer than raising livestock."

"Now that we've started, we can't just abandon them," Luna broke a steamed bun in half, her voice firm. "At least let's raise this batch till year-end. After selling them, we'll reconsider. Don't worry, I've thought it through. As the saying goes, livestock don't count as solid assets. If things go south, I'll bring the boys to join you once you're settled."

Maya looked up in surprise—her sister had gained remarkable clarity overnight.

Their conversation was interrupted when the gate creaked open. Fiona Turner staggered in, her sallow face resembling a starving refugee. Her hungry eyes locked onto the dining table as she plopped down and grabbed chopsticks. "Perfect timing! Auntie hasn't had breakfast yet!"

As Luna started to rise, Maya gripped her wrist. "Auntie," she said coldly, "our food is precious. We can't afford your appetite. If you've nothing important, please leave."

Fiona stuffed her mouth with bun, mumbling through crumbs. "Ungrateful brat! What's wrong with sharing a meal? Fetch me another bowl of porridge!"

"None left!" Maya slammed her chopsticks down. "If you're truly starving, go beg from the old madam. We've no extra for freeloaders!"

Fiona's face turned ashen. Since the matriarch took control, she hadn't eaten a full meal—the old woman doled heaping portions to her grandsons while leaving Fiona mere scraps. Attempting to sneak food? The matriarch's cane struck harder than hunger pangs.

She glared venomously at Maya but dared not act out. This niece had grown formidable—even the matriarch couldn't control her. Cursing inwardly, Fiona finally slunk away.

Watching the hunched retreating figure, Luna sighed. "The old woman's tormenting her to death."

"Serves her right!" Maya scoffed. "Remember how she treated the matriarch? Karma's a bitch. Don't soften, Sis. Give an inch, she'll take a mile—showing up for meals daily."

Outside the gate, Fiona clutched her growling stomach, eyes flashing with malice. She'd make them pay—sooner or later.
###Chapter 145: Talking to Herself

When Flora White realized no one was paying attention to her—everyone in the room was focused on their meal—she slammed her chopsticks down with a sharp clatter.

"Maya's getting married on the sixth of July. You two should come early to help out. No need for extravagant gifts—just five dollars each will do."

Luna nearly laughed aloud. In their village, wedding gifts rarely exceeded a few cents. Yet Flora had the audacity to demand five dollars.

"Auntie, we don’t have the money. We won’t be attending Maya’s wedding," Luna said calmly, stirring her bowl of porridge. "After all, you didn’t bring gifts when my sister got married. And when I marry, I won’t bother inviting you either—no need to trouble yourselves."

Flora’s face darkened. "What kind of talk is that? How can family skip a wedding? People will say you’ve got no conscience! Besides, you grew up in our—"

Selene slammed her palm on the table. "Auntie, we pay you nineteen dollars every month. Why was my sister starving then?" Her voice trembled with anger. "And now you dare ask for more?"

"Who said she starved? She chose not to eat!" Flora retorted, lifting her chin defiantly.

Luna seized Flora’s wrist. "Heaven sees everything. Keep doing evil, and you’ll face the consequences."

Flora gasped in pain, wrenching free before bolting for the door. "If lightning strikes, let it hit the old lady first! I’ve delivered the message—I’m leaving!"

Luna took a long sip of warm cornmeal porridge, letting the heat spread through her.

"What happened to Aunt Flora?" Selene sighed. "They weren’t like this when Mom and Dad were alive."

"Who cares?" Luna narrowed her eyes. "I’d love to see what kind of future Maya will have with Frank Harris."

The grudges from her past life—she’d make sure the entire White family tasted them.

Locked in her room, with even the windows nailed shut, Maya sat docile as a kitten when Frank arrived with the betrothal gifts.

"Running is pointless. Might as well make the best of it," she murmured, combing her hair before the mirror. "The Harris family has money. Better than ending up on the streets."

She began packing her dowry, carefully folding the new clothes Frank had brought.

In the main hall, Ethan White circled the gifts eagerly. "Grandma, I want to propose to Lisa Wilson tomorrow!"

Clara White snorted. "What’s the rush? Lisa’s already twenty-three. If anyone should be anxious, it’s her family."

"But what if—"

"Useless!" The old woman jabbed his forehead. "Pathetic, acting like this before the bride even enters the house!"

Ethan retreated sheepishly, though his gaze remained fixed on the slightly used radio among the gifts.
###Chapter 146: Ethan's Return

"What should we do?" Ethan White rubbed his hands anxiously.

Clara White slammed her palm on the table, rattling the teacups. Since recovering from her illness, the old woman's temper had grown worse. She was quick to throw things and curse, dragging ancestors into her tirades. Jack White and his wife had learned to avoid her, either hiding in their rooms like frightened quails or making excuses to slip away to the fields.

"What? Are my words meaningless now?"

Ethan immediately wilted. His parents had warned him—Clara had to be humored now. If they were truly kicked out, he might never get married.

Endure it!

"You're in charge, of course!" Ethan muttered, slinking out the door.

Clara glanced at the items on the table, snorted, and turned over to lie down.

The day after tomorrow was Maya's wedding. Andrew Smith had already bought Luna's train ticket—his officer status secured her a sleeper berth. The journey from the county town to the provincial capital took over twenty hours, and a hard seat would leave one's bones aching.

When Luna tried to refuse, Andrew slapped the ticket on the table and said coldly, "I'll drive you there myself." Then he walked away without giving her a chance to argue.

This man... Luna sighed. Aside from his stubbornness, Andrew was flawless. He gave her money, bought her tickets, and often came to help with chores. Her sister Maya sang his praises, practically eager to marry Luna off to him.

Luna massaged her temples. She couldn't cut ties with Andrew yet—his presence eased the side effects of her supernatural ability. In her past life, frequent healing had left her suffering unbearable backlash, driving her to desperate measures.

Sometimes, she felt despicable, as if she were using him.

Did my heart turn darker after reincarnating?

She set aside the unanswerable questions. Right now, Maya's wedding was the priority. According to village tradition, a bride's family hosted a two-day feast before the wedding. Though it was just noodles, the villagers happily came to share in the joy.

As Luna and Iris headed out to help, the courtyard gate suddenly swung open.

"Brother!" Luna exclaimed in delight, grabbing the military-green duffel bag.

"I thought you weren’t on leave until the end of the year?" Her eyes sparkled.

Iris quickly pulled their brother inside. "You’ve gotten so thin and dark! Have you eaten? Let me make you some noodles." Ethan was the family’s hope—honest and dependable.

Wiping sweat from his brow, Ethan asked, "I’m starving. Sis, why are you back?" He noticed the refurbished courtyard, even the rebuilt stove, assuming Iris had done the work.

Iris stayed silent and headed to the kitchen.

"Maya’s moved back in with her three kids," Luna said, bringing him a basin of water to wash his face.

"What? Did something happen in Clark Village?" Ethan frowned in confusion.

"She got divorced."

The towel slipped from Ethan’s hand with a splash. "Did that bastard Paul hit her?" His fists clenched with a crack. "Good riddance! If I’d been there, I’d have broken all three of his legs!"

Luna’s nose stung. Ethan was only twenty-two, yet he carried the weight of his sisters' lives. In an era where gossip could drown a person, he stood firmly by Maya without hesitation.

"Brother, it’s so good to have you back," she said softly.

Having someone to lean on—it felt solid.
###Chapter 147: Severing Ties

Luna White emerged from the kitchen carrying a steaming bowl of noodle soup, four golden fried eggs floating on the surface. She pressed the chopsticks into Ethan White's hand, her voice gentle. "Eat up. Fill your stomach first."

Ethan accepted the bowl, his eyes burning. He knew all too well that since Luna's divorce, the Jackson family must have cut off her food supply. This wheat flour was likely saved for the New Year, yet she was using it to treat him. His sister was treating him like an honored guest.

He said nothing, lowering his head to devour the meal. Between family, formalities were unnecessary. In no time, half the bowl was empty.

"Enough? I kneaded more dough. There's plenty," Luna asked with concern.

Ethan shook his head, standing to ladle two scoops of broth from the kitchen. "I'm full, sis. Just some soup will do." He drained it in one gulp before finally asking about Luna's situation.

When he heard that Paul Jackson had tried to kill his own son and slandered Luna's reputation, Ethan's fists clenched until his knuckles cracked. He itched to storm over there immediately.

"Sis, I'll send money every month from now on. The village doesn’t require ration coupons for grain—we’ll manage." He paused. "Luna’s right. There are plenty of people doing business in the city now. Since you don’t have land here, why not set up a stall there?"

Luna gathered the dishes. "I know, Ethan. Once I sell this batch of pigs, I’ll make plans."

"Where were you two headed earlier?"

"Maya’s getting married today at Uncle Jack’s place. We were going to help," Luna replied.

Ethan turned to Luna. "You were vague on the phone last time. Did Uncle Jack and Grandma Clara mistreat you?"

Luna poured out four years of grievances.

Bang! Ethan kicked a stool across the room. "Jack White, that bastard!" He stormed out, Luna unable to hold him back.

The White residence was decked in red, a large pot simmering in the courtyard, the rich aroma of braised meat filling the air. When Jack saw Ethan barging in, his heart dropped. Why had this troublemaker returned?

"Ethan, perfect timing—" He forced a smile and stepped forward.

Ethan marched straight toward Clara. "You tried to sell my sister?" Clara staggered back in fear.

Jack lunged forward. "Ethan, you—" Before he could finish, Ethan kicked him flying.

"What kind of elder sells his own niece?!" Ethan grabbed the fire poker and, with a sharp twist, snapped the iron rod in two.

Jack swallowed his words. The poker bent like dough in Ethan’s hands, twisting into a knot.

"From today on, our families are done!" Ethan hurled the mangled iron to the ground. "If any of you dare mess with my sister again, I’ll beat you to a pulp!"

The crowd gasped at the deformed metal. This wasn’t a man—it was a raging tiger!

Jack’s face turned ashen. If he’d known this would happen, why had he ever crossed them?
###Chapter 148: Sibling Heart-to-Heart

Ethan White led his two sisters home and, without a word, grabbed an axe and headed to the backyard to chop firewood.

Luna could tell—her eldest brother was venting his anger.

Given Ethan’s temper, the only reason he’d let Jack White’s family off so easily today was likely out of concern for their sister Iris’s reputation in the village. After all, he’d have to return to the military soon. If he wasn’t around and Jack’s shameless family came looking for trouble again, he couldn’t just keep taking leave to deal with them.

That was why he’d held back. Otherwise, with Ethan’s skills, Jack’s sons would’ve been beaten beyond recognition.

More importantly, as a soldier, assaulting Jack and his wife would have serious consequences. If they reported him to his superiors, a disciplinary action would be the least of his worries.

Luna nodded to herself. Her brother had grown wiser compared to their past life—he knew how to strategize now. The display of his skills alone was enough to intimidate anyone in the village who might think of bullying Iris.

"Still angry, big bro?" Luna crouched beside him, watching as the axe split a log clean in two. "We’re all fine now, aren’t we?"

Ethan didn’t pause his chopping, his voice low. "I’m not mad at them. I’m mad at myself. You lived with Uncle Jack for four years, and every time I came home to visit, I stayed for days—yet I never noticed what you were going through. What good are these eyes of mine?"

The axe came down hard, sending wood chips flying.

"If I weren’t wearing this uniform, I’d have broken Jack and his wife’s legs!" he growled through gritted teeth. "Four years—how could they do that to you?"

Luna grinned and sidled up to him, wrapping her arms around his and giving it a playful shake. "Big bro, I’m perfectly fine now. If you keep being angry, I’ll get angry too!" She pouted exaggeratedly.

Ethan couldn’t help but chuckle, ruffling her hair. "You little rascal, where did you learn to talk back like this? If you were this sharp before, how’d you let them push you around? Even if you couldn’t fight them, you could’ve secretly told me! I’d have given up this uniform in a heartbeat if it meant protecting you."

"Please," Luna scoffed. "You joined the military just to pay for my schooling. If you’d quit for my sake, what would we have lived on? Thin air?"

She paused, her expression turning serious. "Ethan, you need to think things through from now on. People like Uncle Jack aren’t worth risking your future over. If we’re going to deal with them, we have to be smart about it."

Ethan let out a bitter laugh. "I just wish I’d been strong enough to protect you."

"Stop that!" She tightened her grip on his arm. "Look at me now—I got into military medical school! We’ll be comrades soon. And Maya and Iris will have better lives too."

She tilted her head up, eyes shining. "You should focus on your studies in the military too. The forces are modernizing, and you can’t afford to fall behind."

Ethan pulled her into a rough hug, mussing her hair. "Listen to you, lecturing your big brother now!"

The yard filled with the siblings’ laughter.
###Chapter 149: The Brother's Test

"Luna!" A deep male voice called from behind.

Luna White and the young man beside her turned simultaneously. Andrew Smith stood a short distance away, his intense gaze fixed on them. Seeing Luna laugh so freely with another man twisted something inside him—she never smiled like that when they were together.

Though logic told him Luna wasn't the type to flirt casually, and he knew she had an older brother in the military, Andrew couldn't help the bitter sting in his chest. Did she really think so little of him?

"An... Andrew?" Luna's heart skipped a beat. She hadn't mentioned this sudden fiancé to her brother yet.

Ethan White narrowed his eyes, his sharp gaze sweeping over Andrew. The two equally tall men locked eyes, tension crackling between them.

"Luna, who's this?"

"Andrew Smith. Luna's fiancé." Andrew spoke first, determined to secure the White family's approval.

"Fiancé?" Ethan whipped his head toward his sister, disbelief written across his face. He'd only been gone half a year—how had she suddenly gotten engaged?

Luna cringed inwardly. Andrew always introduced himself this way to her family.

"Ethan, it's... complicated," she murmured. "I'll explain everything tonight."

Ethan turned back to Andrew and extended a calloused hand. "Ethan White. Luna's brother."

Their hands clasped firmly. As an elite special forces soldier, Ethan had no intention of going easy. If this man couldn't handle a simple test, he didn't deserve to be with his sister.

Andrew felt the pressure and immediately understood the challenge. Without flinching, he matched Ethan's grip, the two men locked in silent combat.

Luna watched as veins bulged on Ethan's forehead while Andrew maintained a calm façade—though the tension in his neck betrayed him.

"I'll... go help Maya with lunch," she said, wisely retreating. This was a battle best left to them.

The courtyard hummed with unspoken rivalry.

Ethan finally released Andrew's hand and rolled his shoulders. "Not bad. Care for a spar?" Meeting a worthy opponent had piqued his interest.

Andrew nodded, shrugging off his jacket and draping it over the woodpile. His olive-green tank top revealed well-defined muscles.

"Special forces?" Ethan stripped off his own shirt.

"Classified unit." Andrew kept it vague, but Ethan instantly recognized the implication—this was one of those shadowy teams with undisclosed identities.

They took their stances, fists and feet cutting through the air.

Meanwhile, in the front yard, Maya White was hanging laundry.

"Luna, what's going on back there?" she asked curiously. "I saw Andrew heading your way earlier."

Luna suppressed a smile. "Who knows?"

Maya rolled her eyes. "Don't play dumb. But Andrew really is something—five visits in ten days despite his training schedule? And he keeps bringing gifts." She gestured to a package on the table. "I told him not to bother."

Luna unwrapped it to find brand-new uniforms and boots. Warmth spread through her chest—these were clearly for Maya's three boys. Andrew's thoughtfulness touched her deeply.

"Maya, these are for Ethan, Aaron, and Samuel."

"We can't accept this!" Maya protested. "They ruin clothes so fast during training. He should keep them for himself."

Luna grinned mischievously. "Tell him that yourself. I'm not getting involved." With that, she ducked into the kitchen to prepare lunch. With Ethan home, they needed a proper feast.
###Chapter 150: Making Dumplings

"Sis, I'm going to get some meat. Let's make dumplings for lunch," Luna said, dusting flour off her hands. "Ethan rarely comes home, so we should make something special. I'll get the meat and stop by Godmother's to pick some chives and fennel—we can make two different fillings."

Maya was spreading out the bedding on the kang and nodded in agreement. "Take the money from my chest and get plenty of meat. Captain Andrew is here today too—let’s treat it like an early New Year’s feast."

Luna didn’t take her sister’s money, pulling out five dollars from her own savings instead. Maya needed to keep her emergency funds.

The butcher’s shop at the village entrance was unusually lively. The village loudspeaker had announced early that morning that fresh pork was available. Meat was hard to come by these days—even at the market, it was rare to see any.

"Dr. White, you’re here!" The butcher greeted Luna warmly. "How much do you need? I’ll pick out the best cut for you."

Luna asked for three pounds of well-marbled pork belly. The butcher refused to take her money at first, only reluctantly accepting after she insisted. He even pressed a pig’s stomach and some intestines into her hands.

"I can’t take these..." Luna protested.

"If you refuse, you’re insulting me!" The butcher scowled. "You saved my child’s life—this is nothing in return."

With no choice, Luna accepted and headed to her godmother Clara’s house.

"Godmother, Ethan’s back. We’re making dumplings for lunch—you, Godfather, and Lily should come over," Luna called from the edge of the vegetable patch.

Clara was feeding the chickens and waved her off. "You siblings should enjoy your reunion. We shouldn’t intrude."

"I already bought three pounds of meat!" Luna blinked. "If you don’t come, I’ll bring the dumplings to you."

"You stubborn girl!" Clara laughed, cutting a generous bunch of chives and fennel. "Fine, fine. Lily can go help you first."

Lily skipped along with Luna back home, announcing as soon as she stepped inside, "Maya, I’m here for free food!"

Maya was kneading dough and chuckled. "Perfect timing—help me chop the filling."

Luna soaked the pig’s stomach and intestines in a basin, making Maya frown. "Those are a pain to clean."

"Don’t worry, I have a trick." Luna smiled mysteriously, sprinkling cornmeal into the water. "This’ll get them clean—no smell at all."

The three girls bustled around the kitchen, the sounds of chopping and laughter drifting far beyond the house. The old locust tree in the yard rustled, as if keeping time for their family feast.
###Chapter 151: Making Dumplings (Part 2)

By the time Ethan White and Andrew Smith changed clothes and stepped outside, they were already as familiar as old friends. In the courtyard, the three women were bustling with activity.

"Dumplings for lunch?" Ethan's eyes lit up. Though the military occasionally served dumplings, they were a rare treat—usually only during New Year celebrations. During field training, cornmeal pancakes were considered a luxury.

Luna pointed to the water vat. "Fetch some water. We specially bought meat today. Captain Smith, you’re staying for lunch—no arguments." Her tone left no room for refusal.

Ethan happily grabbed the carrying pole. He didn’t mind chores, especially with the lively atmosphere at home.

Andrew didn’t protest. He was on leave today and had come to visit Luna before she left. He hadn’t expected to end up sparring with her brother. But it had been a satisfying fight—he hadn’t met such a skilled opponent in a long time. Clearly, the brother was sending him a message.

"Big Sis, I’ll mince the meat." He rolled up his sleeves and took the cleaver without hesitation. The chunks of meat on the cutting board soon turned into fine mince under his blade.

Luna chuckled. "You’ve got quite the technique, Instructor Smith. Do you cook at home?" She was growing fonder of her future brother-in-law by the minute. A man who could cook meant her sister would have an easier life.

"I know the basics," Andrew replied modestly.

Lily Clark nudged Luna with her elbow. "You’re lucky."

"Get back to chopping!" Luna’s cheeks flushed as she set aside the cleaned pork tripe. She needed to borrow some chili peppers from the neighbor—everyone here loved spicy food.

Once the meat was minced, Luna began seasoning it. Lily chopped leeks and fennel for two different fillings. In the kitchen, Luna rolled out the dough while Luna and Lily wrapped the dumplings.

Luna’s movements were practiced. In her past life with the Harris family, she’d done all this alone. The men there considered kitchen work beneath them, so she’d mastered every skill out of necessity.

"Luna, your dumplings look just like Mom’s," Luna remarked admiringly.

Lily glanced at her own lopsided creations and flushed with embarrassment. Back home, she’d never lifted a finger for housework.

Luna patiently guided her. Lily was quick to learn and soon shaped decent dumplings.

When Clara Clark and George Clark arrived and saw their daughter’s handiwork, they nearly dropped their jaws.

"Did… Lily make these?" Clara couldn’t believe her eyes.

Lily proudly demonstrated by wrapping another. "Well, Mom?"

"Better than mine!" Clara exclaimed, both shocked and delighted.

Lily winked at Luna. "Be careful—the student might surpass the teacher."

Luna dodged her flour-dusted hands. "At this rate, I’ll be out of a job."

Clara looked at Luna with gratitude. She’d never expected this girl to teach her daughter such skills.

"Godmother, why don’t you peel garlic? The kitchen’s too crowded," Luna suggested, gently ushering Clara out.

The men set up two small tables outside. Luna boiled water for the dumplings while Luna fried peanuts in another pan, using a method that made them spicy and crispy—just like the bar snacks from her past life.

She’d scrubbed the pork tripe thoroughly with cornmeal and salt, then sliced it into strips before stir-frying it with peppercorns, chili, and fermented bean paste. The aroma filled the air instantly.

Lily sneaked a bite and nearly swooned. "Heavens! No gaminess at all—this is better than any restaurant in town!"

When the dishes were served, George couldn’t take his eyes off the stir-fried tripe. "Luna, this is incredible!"

Andrew poured his future father-in-law a drink, heart swelling with pride. With such a capable wife, life would be sweet indeed.
###Chapter 152: Unexpected Turn

The steaming dumplings, plump and white, were neatly arranged on plates. A bowl of minced garlic mixed with fragrant vinegar and a spoonful of bright red chili oil filled the air with an enticing aroma.

Two tables were gathered with people. Mayor George Clark, the eldest present, raised his glass and cleared his throat. "Ethan rarely comes home, and now Luna is leaving for university in the provincial capital. Consider this a farewell feast. The men can drink, and the ladies should enjoy the food."

Laughter filled the room as everyone picked up their chopsticks. Andrew Smith bit into a dumpling, and rich meat juices burst in his mouth. The filling—a perfect mix of lean and fatty pork with chives—was so delicious he couldn't stop. He tried another with fennel, its unique aroma lingering pleasantly.

A sip of liquor, then a bite of stir-fried tripe. The meal was thoroughly satisfying.

After several rounds of drinks, Mayor George was swaying drunkenly and had to be supported home by Clara Clark and Lily Clark. Ethan and Andrew were also flushed from drinking. Luna had the three boys help them inside to rest.

In the yard, Luna and her sister Luna cleared the dishes. Worried there wouldn’t be enough, they had made extra dumplings, leaving two plates uncooked. Since raw dumplings didn’t keep well, the sisters boiled them all, rinsing them in cold water to prevent sticking for the next meal.

"Luna, Andrew is such a good man. You're lucky," Luna couldn’t help saying. She could tell her sister wasn’t particularly interested in him, and it would be a shame to let such a catch slip away.

Luna nearly rolled her eyes. Andrew had really won over the whole family.

"I know, sis!"

"Your attitude..." Luna sighed. "You’ve become so stubborn lately. If this continues, Andrew might lose interest."

"Sis, this is who I am. If he doesn’t like it, that’s his problem. Can fake sweetness last a lifetime?" Luna was unbothered. She had played the dutiful wife and mother in her past life—this time, she would be herself.

"You..." Luna shook her head but knew her sister had a point. Hadn’t she spent her own life yielding, only to end up like this?

In the afternoon, Andrew woke to find himself alone in the room. The alcohol had mostly worn off, though his head still throbbed slightly. The yard was quiet, and his freshly washed clothes swayed gently on the clothesline.

Luna had just returned from Clara White’s place. The old woman had suddenly summoned the siblings, and Luna had braced for another round of drama.

To her surprise, Clara seemed like a different person, clutching Ethan’s hand with tears in her eyes. "Ethan, Grandma knows she was wrong before..."

Ethan awkwardly wiped her tears. "Grandma, don’t cry. It’s bad for your eyes."

"I still have some money saved. Take it for your wedding," Clara insisted, pressing a cloth bundle into his hands.

Ethan refused. "Keep it for yourself. I can save up for my own wedding."

But the old woman was adamant. "Take it! Grandma has realized... I’ll be counting on you kids from now on..."

Luna watched coldly, suspicion gnawing at her. What’s this old woman scheming now?
###Chapter 153: A Change of Heart

Luna White's lips curled slightly, her eyes flashing with mockery. Had the old woman suddenly grown a conscience?

She didn't buy it.

Originally, she had planned to let Clara White and Jack White tear each other apart, sparing Ethan and Iris some trouble. But now, out of nowhere, the old woman was bawling like a heartbroken widow.

What kind of act was this?

"Grandma, you heard about the scene I caused at Uncle Jack's place today," Ethan suddenly spoke, his voice firm. "I won’t have anything to do with him from now on. If you’re unhappy here, you can come live with us."

Luna’s heart sank.

Her brother was too kind.

Clara’s eyes gleamed—she’d been waiting for those exact words. Luna gritted her teeth. Was he really inviting a tyrant into their home?

She stared at her own slender, pale hands. If the old woman dared to move in, she wouldn’t hesitate to strike again. At worst, she’d make sure Clara never left her bed—better that than letting her lord over the household.

"Ethan, dear..." Clara wiped her tears. "Grandma knows you’re a good boy. But this house was built with your money. If I leave, won’t those ungrateful wolves take it all?"

Luna’s pupils constricted.

Had the old hag actually changed?

"I’m staying right here." Clara straightened her back. "They’ve benefited enough over the years. Think they can shirk their duty to care for me? Not a chance! As long as I’m here, they won’t dare harass you!"

Luna and Iris exchanged bewildered glances.

This wasn’t the Clara they knew!

"Grandma, don’t say that..." Ethan faltered.

"You must take this money!" Clara suddenly turned stern. "Or else you’re saying you won’t forgive me!"

Ethan had no choice but to accept, his eyes reddening. After four years, this was the first time their grandmother had shown them kindness.

"Thieving wench! What are you skulking around for?" Clara suddenly grabbed a broom and hurled it at the doorway.

Fiona Turner yelped and jumped back, clutching her head, her face twisted with fury. Why hadn’t this old crone kicked the bucket yet?

"Mom, I just wanted to ask Ethan for a favor..." Fiona forced a smile.

"Get lost!" Clara roared. "Where was this 'family' talk when you were abusing Luna? Now you come crawling for help? Dream on!"

Ethan quickly stepped in to calm the trembling old woman.

"Grandma, we won’t go. In a couple of days, I’ll be taking Luna to the city for school."

Clara turned to Luna and beckoned her closer.

"Luna..." She pulled out twenty dollars. "Grandma was wrong. But remember—your brother and sister have given you their all. Don’t you dare let them down."

Luna clutched the money, her fingertips burning.

This was the first time Clara had ever willingly given her anything.

"I know," she said softly. "I’ll be good to them."

In this world, they were the only ones who truly cared for her.
###Chapter 154: Flustered

The elderly woman kept chattering with Ethan White and Luna White, making Luna feel inexplicably irritated. She decided to head home alone.

As she entered the courtyard, she spotted Andrew Smith standing under the eaves, staring at her with such intensity he looked like a lovestruck fool.

Luna couldn't help giggling. She took the freshly laundered military uniform from the clothesline, gave it a gentle shake, and handed it to him. "I washed it for you. You smelled like alcohol at noon—didn't want you getting scolded when you returned."

Andrew accepted the garment, his fingertips brushing against the soft fabric. His chest warmed unexpectedly. So this sharp-tongued girl could be thoughtful too.

"Thanks," he said, his voice oddly tight.

"What's there to thank?" Luna waved dismissively. "After all you've done for me, washing clothes is nothing."

As Andrew slipped on the uniform, the faint scent of soap made him smile unconsciously. This simple fragrance surpassed any expensive cologne.

"Oh," Luna suddenly remembered, "my brother's taking me to school the day after tomorrow. No need for you to make a special trip." She pulled out paper and pen from her pocket. "Give me your military base address—I'll write to you when I arrive."

Andrew blinked in surprise. Since when had she become so forward?

"What? Can't tell me?" Luna tilted her head.

"No, it's just..." Andrew hurried to explain, "I'm being transferred soon. This address won't be valid for long."

Luna nodded and dashed inside, returning with a slip of paper. "Here's my school address."

Andrew's eyes lit up reading it. Aeronautical University? This girl had enrolled in aviation studies!

"The training will be tough," he couldn't help warning. "You should prepare yourself."

Luna winked playfully. "Who knows? Maybe I'll be flying planes someday!" Imagining herself in a pilot's uniform, she suppressed a smile.

"I'll still come see you off," Andrew insisted.

Just then, Ethan and Aaron Jackson returned carrying pig feed, immediately shouting, "Uncle Andrew!" upon spotting him.

Luna's face burned crimson. "You little—"

"I should go." Andrew gave the boys a meaningful look, and they promptly scampered to the backyard.

"Wait!" Luna suddenly dashed into the kitchen, emerging with a steaming lunchbox packed with dumplings. "For the road."

Andrew accepted the warm container, gazing at her intently. "I'll see you the day after tomorrow." With that, he strode away purposefully.

Luna touched her flaming cheeks, bewildered by her own reaction. What's happening to me?

That evening, Ethan and Luna returned home, discussing their grandmother's strange behavior with disbelief. Luna began packing her luggage under her sister's supervision, soon accumulating numerous bags.

"Good thing your brother's accompanying you," Luna remarked while folding clothes. "You'd never manage all this alone."

Luna's heart swelled seeing the brand-new olive-green suitcase—her brother's gift to ensure she wouldn't face ridicule at school.

Late that night, lying in bed, Luna found Andrew's deep-set eyes haunting her thoughts. She rolled over, burying her face in the pillow.

How... utterly mortifying.
###Chapter 155: The Farce Comes Knocking

Luna White crouched by the stove, feeding firewood into the flames. Steam rose from the pot where fluffy buns were cooking, filling the kitchen with a warm, yeasty aroma. Outside, Ethan Jackson and his three brothers were chopping firewood, while Ethan White repaired a hoe. The household was busy with their tasks, and no one mentioned the wedding festivities happening in the village.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

The gate shuddered under violent knocking. Iris wiped flour from her hands and went to answer. Aunt Elizabeth Wright stood there, beaming. "Goodness, why are you all still working? The White household is in complete chaos!"

Luna didn’t look up. "Auntie, we have nothing to do with that family anymore."

"Don’t say that!" Elizabeth pushed her way inside. "Young Master Harris is calling off the engagement! Maya and her parents are over there trying to calm things down—aren’t you going to see what’s happening?"

The firewood in Luna’s hands snapped with a sharp crack. "Iris went?"

Ethan White immediately set down his hoe. "Let’s go."

By the time the three arrived at the White residence, the scene was already in disarray. Frank Harris had Henry Cooper by the collar, while Iris stood nearby, wringing her hands in distress.

"Stop!" Ethan’s voice boomed across the yard.

Frank turned, sneering when he recognized Ethan. "Well, if it isn’t the great Ethan White. Here to meddle in other people’s business?"

Luna stepped forward, shielding Iris. "Master Harris, isn’t today supposed to be your happy occasion? Doesn’t seem fitting to be throwing punches."

"None of your damn business!" Frank shoved Henry away. "I’m calling off this sham of a marriage!"

Jack White wrung his hands. "Frank, let’s talk this through—"

"Talk? About what?" Frank jabbed a finger at Maya, who burst into tears. "You think trash like her is worthy of the Harris family?"

Luna narrowed her eyes. "If you never intended to marry her, why propose in the first place? Or is this just your way of humiliating our family?"

Frank opened his mouth to retort, but his bravado faltered when he noticed Ethan’s crisp military uniform.

Ethan’s voice was low and dangerous. "Master Harris. You owe us an explanation."

Frank’s eyes darted, then he smirked. "Fine. You want an explanation?" He grabbed Maya’s arm. "Let’s go register the marriage right now!"

Before Maya could react, she was dragged toward the gate. Jack and his wife scrambled after them, terrified their golden opportunity was slipping away.

Luna watched them leave, then snorted. "Iris, let’s go home."

Iris bit her lip. "We’re just letting this go?"

"Don’t worry." Luna patted her hand. "They’ll regret this soon enough."

Back home, Luna’s eldest sister had finished steaming the buns. Luna took one, still warm, split it open, and stuffed it with pickled vegetables before taking a hearty bite.

"Delicious," she murmured, savoring the taste.

Ethan picked up a bun as well. "I leave tomorrow. Might as well enjoy a good meal today."

The Jackson brothers, ravenous, devoured theirs in seconds.

Luna’s sister watched them fondly. "Slow down. There’s plenty more."

As the sun set, the scent of freshly steamed buns lingered in the yard, wrapping the family in contentment. Meanwhile, the wedding feast at the White residence was in full swing—though beneath the laughter and chatter, something unsettling lurked.
###Chapter 156: Halt

The White family's wedding arrangements were utterly disgraceful.

Jack White and his wife had cut every corner to save money, failing to provide even a single decent dowry item for their daughter. The bundles contained nothing but Maya White's old clothes. Though the quilts were new, there wasn't a single respectable belonging among them.

Frank Harris arrived for the bride in high spirits. But at the gate, Ethan White and Bai Zhuang blocked his path, demanding red envelopes. While wedding gate-crashing was customary, they refused to let him pass, complaining the envelopes contained too little money. When Frank finally entered, his heart sank at the sight of the empty tractor.

"Two hundred in bride price plus three major appliances, and all I get are these shabby bundles?" Frank's face darkened like storm clouds.

Maya's rouged cheeks looked lovely, but Frank barely contained his anger, reminding himself this was supposed to be a joyous occasion. As he led Maya toward the tractor, Bai Zhuang blocked them again.

"No ten-dollar red envelope? Then I won't send off the bride!" Bai Zhuang crossed his arms like a petty thug.

Frank finally snapped. He shoved Maya's hand away. "Marry or don't marry! If not, return my bride price!"

The scene froze.

Jack flushed with humiliation. Backing down would shame him forever in the village. But if the wedding fell through, what would happen to the bride price he'd already pocketed?

Spotting Iris White and her husband Henry Cooper in the crowd, Jack desperately signaled for them to intervene.

But the gentle couple only drew Frank's wrath. Enraged, Frank swung his fist at Henry.

"Stop!"

The command cracked like thunder.

Frank turned, ready to curse, but froze when he saw Luna White. He'd thought this demon had left for university. The memory of their last encounter sent shivers down his spine.

"Who... who are you?" Frank blustered, though his eyes kept darting to Luna's hands.

Ethan White stepped forward, knocking Frank back with a single shoulder check.

"Oof!" Clutching his chest, Frank's voice shrank when he saw Ethan's military uniform. "Comrade Soldier, you—"

Jack scurried over. "Ethan, look at this groom! Hitting his in-laws before the wedding's even done! What will happen later?"

Frank protested, "Father-in-law, be fair! What family gives no dowry? My bride price was substantial! And now her brother demands ten dollars—this is robbery!"

Villagers whispered, their disdainful glances stinging.

Jack forced a laugh. "Frank, Bai Zhuang was just joking..."

With village elders mediating, Frank grudgingly controlled his temper. He wanted nothing more than to escape Luna's presence.

"Wait." Ethan's voice turned glacial.

Frank's back stiffened. "C-Comrade Soldier, anything else?"

Ethan pointed to Iris's bruised face. "You're done. Now we settle our account."

Iris tugged her brother's sleeve. "Please, it's a happy occasion..."

Clara White added, "We're family now. Don't give outsiders a show."

Frank forced a smile. "My apologies, brother and sister-in-law! I'll make it right tomorrow!" He scrambled toward the tractor.

As one foot touched the vehicle, Ethan spoke again: "Did I say you could leave?"
###Chapter 157: Run for Your Life

"Ah!" Frank Harris suddenly let out a piercing scream, his entire body convulsing as if struck by lightning.

Before anyone could react, he dropped to his knees before Luna White, cold sweat instantly beading on his forehead.

"What in the..." The surrounding villagers gaped in shock.

How had the arrogant groom, who had been strutting about moments ago, ended up kneeling before a young girl?

Luna's slender fingers rested lightly on Frank's wrist, but the pressure made him gasp in pain.

"Frank Harris," Luna's voice was soft, yet it sent a shiver down his spine. "Did you think you could hit someone and just walk away?"

"N-No! I—I'll make it right!" Frank stammered, his face twisted in agony.

Ethan White stepped forward protectively, ready to shield his sister. He hadn't expected Luna to confront the village troublemaker so boldly.

Frank cursed his luck. If he'd known Luna was here, he would've thought twice before acting!

"I'll pay for the damages!" he gritted out through clenched teeth. "Ten—no, twenty dollars!"

The wedding party gasped. Twenty dollars? That was a fortune!

Iris and Henry Cooper quickly waved their hands. "That's too much!"

"Sis, if you don't take it, I'll stay kneeling!" Frank pleaded, sweat pouring down his face. He risked a glance at Luna—her faint, knowing smile made his stomach drop.

Reluctantly, Iris accepted the red envelope. Only then did Frank dare to scramble to his feet, desperate to flee.

"Wait."

Luna's quiet command froze him in place.

"Y-Yes, sis? What else?" His forced smile looked more like a grimace.

Luna flexed her fingers, knuckles cracking ominously. "Remember this—treat my sister with respect from now on."

"Absolutely! I swear!" Frank nodded frantically.

"Now get lost." She flicked her wrist dismissively.

Frank didn't need telling twice. He practically threw himself onto the tractor, shouting hoarsely, "Drive! Now!"

The engine roared to life, kicking up a cloud of dust as the vehicle lurched forward. The villagers burst into laughter, assuming the groom was simply eager for his wedding night.

Only Frank knew the truth—he never wanted to set foot in Six Paths Village again.
###Chapter 158: Wedding Night Farce

Maya White sat rigidly on the tractor, her fingers digging into the hem of her dress. The women around her—aunts and cousins who had come to see her off—chattered and laughed, oblivious to her ashen expression.

"Maya, it's good that your family put the groom in his place!" Aunt Wang leaned in with a grin. "That way, he'll know his place when you're married."

"Exactly! Look how obedient Frank is—he does whatever he's told," Li Erniu giggled behind her hand.

Maya's chest heaved. Obedient? More like spineless! The way her husband had groveled before Luna was downright humiliating.

The tractor rumbled into the Harris family's village, the deafening crackle of firecrackers drowning out all other sounds. As she was helped down, Maya nearly stumbled, her eyes burning holes into Frank's back.

The bridal chamber, at least, looked presentable—white walls, red-framed windows, and a towering stack of brand-new quilts. Mechanically, Maya went through the wedding rituals before retreating inside with a few thin red envelopes in hand.

"I'm dead tired!" Frank collapsed onto the kang like a sack of potatoes the moment he entered.

Maya finally snapped. "The way you acted back at the Whites'—"

Before she could finish, Frank lunged up and slapped her across the face.

"You worthless bitch! Marrying you was the worst mistake of my life!" He yanked her collar, snarling. "You're the only bride in the whole damn village without a dowry! You've made me a laughingstock!"

Her vision swam, her cheek burning. In a flash of fury, she raked her nails down his neck.

Frank howled as she kicked him off the kang. They tumbled to the floor in a vicious tangle—his fists like iron, battering her until she could barely breathe. If Old Man Harris hadn't shouted from outside, she might have blacked out.

"Just you wait! I'll finish you off when I get back!" Frank spat before storming out, slamming the door behind him.

Maya lay sprawled on the kang, blood trickling from her split lip. She stared at the ceiling, tears streaming uncontrollably. This is all Luna's fault! If it weren't for that—

Raucous laughter drifted in from outside. Wiping her face, Maya forced herself to straighten her clothes. She practiced a smile in the mirror until it looked convincing.

"The bride's coming out for the toast!"

Maya minced over to Frank's side, demurely accepting a glass of liquor. The men's rowdy cheers made her ears burn.

"Frank's a lucky man!"
"What a pretty wife!"

Frank smugly wrapped an arm around her waist, his grip painfully tight. Maya smiled through gritted teeth, downing glass after glass.

Late that night, Frank drunkenly pinned her down. She endured in silence, her nails biting into her palms. The pale moonlight through the window glinted off the bruises already darkening her arms.

That night, Maya realized one thing—her happy ending would never come.
###Chapter 159: Accountability

Iris was dragged back home by Ethan and the others. As soon as she sat down, Luna quickly boiled a few eggs, peeled them, and handed them to Henry. "Brother-in-law, use these to soothe your eyes."

Henry took the eggs and rolled them gently over his bruised eye sockets. Luna frowned at the injury—if they applied red medicine, how would he face people tomorrow? But using her supernatural ability for such a minor injury seemed excessive.

It wasn’t until everyone started talking over each other that Iris finally learned about everything that had happened at home. Her eyes widened in shock. "Big Sister got divorced? And she came back with three kids?" She smacked her thigh in frustration. "I should’ve come home sooner!"

"Don’t worry, things are much better now," Luna said with a smile, patting her sister’s hand. "Getting rid of that beast Paul was a relief."

Iris gritted her teeth. In all her years of marriage to Henry, he had never once raised a hand at her, no matter how angry he got. The thought of what her sister had endured made her wish she could tear Paul to pieces.

"Sis, if you ever need anything, just say the word," Iris declared, straightening her back. "I’m the workshop supervisor now—my salary’s doubled!" She shot a proud glance at Henry. "And he’ll officially start driving in two months."

Ethan looked confused. "What does this have to do with Luna?"

Only then did Iris explain how Luna had saved the factory manager’s brother-in-law. Henry nodded emphatically. "Big Sister, we’re family. We’ll get through anything together."

Meanwhile, Ethan pulled Luna into the inner room and shut the door, his expression darkening. "Luna, tell me the truth. All that talk about the King of Hell and our parents sending you dreams—you might fool your sisters, but I’m not buying it."

Luna blinked, tugging Ethan down to sit beside her. "Brother, I’m telling the truth." Her gaze was clear, unwavering. "I can’t explain it, but this ability is real."

Ethan studied her for a long moment before finally sighing. "Fine. But from now on, tell people it’s medical knowledge Dad taught you." He lowered his voice. "There’s an old Chinese medicine expert in the army who’s incredible with acupuncture. Say you learned from him. Don’t slip up."

"Got it, you worrywart!" Luna giggled, hugging his arm.

Ethan flicked her forehead. "Be serious! You’re getting bolder by the day." His expression turned grave. "Remember what I said—always be careful."

Rubbing her forehead, Luna felt warmth spread through her chest. In this life, having her family’s protection was a blessing. She’d never let herself be used and discarded like she had in her past life.
###Chapter 160: The Pickpocket

Dawn had barely broken when Luna White quietly slipped out of bed. The aroma of scallion pancakes wafted from the kitchen—she had added two extra eggs, wanting her younger siblings to have a hearty meal before their journey.

"Luna, wake up. Breakfast is ready." She gently nudged her still-sleeping sister, Luna.

Rubbing her eyes, Luna sat up and saw that her eldest sister had already packed their belongings. A cloth bundle held ten boiled eggs, still warm.

"You're up too early," Luna murmured, noticing the dark circles under her sister’s eyes.

Luna White shook her head with a soft smile. "How could I sleep when you're leaving for such a long trip?"

At the village entrance, Andrew Smith’s jeep was already waiting. Luna White held her sister’s hand, her voice thick with worry. "Write to us as soon as you arrive. If you need anything—"

Luna’s nose stung, tears threatening to spill. This was her first time leaving home since her reincarnation, and the emptiness in her chest was overwhelming.

"Don’t worry, sis. It’s not like I’ll never come back," she forced a laugh.

Ethan White patted his sister’s shoulder. "Let’s go. We’ll miss the train if we delay any longer."

As the jeep pulled away, Luna turned to look through the rear window. Her sister and three nephews grew smaller and smaller until they vanished into the distance.

"Don’t be sad. You’ll visit during breaks," Ethan reassured her.

Andrew glanced at her through the rearview mirror, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Don’t worry. I’ll visit you often."

"Who asked you to?" Luna flushed and turned away, though she couldn’t suppress a small smile.

The train station was packed. Andrew effortlessly maneuvered through the crowd with two suitcases in hand, while Luna clutched her backpack strap tightly, afraid of getting separated.

"Your sleeper is in Car 6," Andrew handed the tickets to Ethan. "You two aren’t together, so find someone to switch seats."

The train car was stuffy and crowded. Ethan swiftly stowed their luggage and double-checked Luna’s backpack.

"Keep your wallet in the inner pocket. Don’t let it out of your sight," he warned sternly. "There are pickpockets everywhere."

As the train pulled away, Andrew’s figure grew smaller in the distance. A sudden hollowness settled in Luna’s chest.

"What are you staring at?" Ethan handed her an apple. "Lieutenant Smith packed this for you."

Luna took the apple and discovered her backpack was stuffed with snacks and fruit. At the very bottom was a book—Andrew’s well-worn copy of On War.

The next morning, the train arrived at its destination. Ethan carried two large suitcases while Luna followed with her backpack.

"Ethan, the bus stop is over there," she pointed.

Suddenly, Ethan lunged forward and grabbed a man in a cap.

"What are you doing?" the man shouted, struggling.

A girl in a floral dress gasped. "My wallet!"

The crowd erupted into murmurs. The man’s eyes darted around before he yelled, "Help! This man’s trying to rob me!"

Passengers exchanged uncertain glances. Someone muttered, "He’s in uniform… seems trustworthy."

Ethan smirked. "Luna, show them my ID."

Without hesitation, Luna pulled out his military credentials. The bright red seal gleamed unmistakably under the sunlight.

"Take him to the police!" someone shouted.

The man’s face paled. He yanked a razor blade from his pocket. "Back off, or I’ll cut you!"

Ethan dodged with lightning reflexes, twisted the man’s arm, and flipped him onto the ground with a loud thud.

"Ethan!" Luna gasped.

"Don’t worry." He dusted his hands off and addressed the approaching officers. "This one’s a repeat offender."

The girl in the floral dress bowed deeply. "Thank you so much! My acceptance letter was in that wallet!"

Luna helped her up, realizing this journey was turning out far more eventful than she’d expected.
###Chapter 161: Race Against Death

Ethan White had barely stepped off the bus when three burly men surrounded him. The glint of steel flashed as three sharp knives pressed against his vital points.

"Let her go if you know what's good for you!" The leader, a scar-faced man, growled menacingly. "Or you'll bleed."

The bus fell dead silent. Passengers shrank back, not daring to make a sound.

"Just leave me!" The girl whose wallet had been stolen stamped her foot in frustration, her eyes reddening. "There are too many of them..."

Luna White dragged her suitcase to a safe distance and waved at the girl. "Come over here. Stay out of the way."

The girl's eyes widened in disbelief. She had assumed Luna was Ethan's companion, but instead, she was just a cold bystander.

"I'm not leaving!" She stubbornly planted herself beside Ethan, though her voice trembled.

Luna raised an eyebrow. "Can you fight?"

"I... I can't." The girl bit her lip. "But I won't let good people suffer for helping me!"

The scar-faced man leered and reached out to touch her face. "Feisty little thing—"

Before he could finish, Ethan twisted his wrist with a swift motion. A sharp crack echoed as the man screamed and collapsed. A side kick sent another thug sprawling.

"Get back!" Ethan gently pushed the girl away.

The remaining two thugs lunged with their knives. The girl tried to rush forward to help, but Luna yanked her back.

"Are you insane?"

"I can't just watch him—"

"Save it!" Luna rolled her eyes. "My brother's a special forces soldier."

The girl froze. By then, Ethan had already dispatched the last two thugs with lightning-fast precision.

Cheers erupted through the bus. Several brave young men jumped out to assist.

Suddenly, one of the thugs bolted blindly into the road.

"Look out!"

A military jeep swerved sharply but collided with a bus behind it. The screech of twisting metal filled the air as three vehicles crumpled into a tangled wreck.

Thick smoke billowed upward.

"Rescue first!" Ethan sprinted toward the wreckage like an arrow.

Luna dropped her luggage and followed without hesitation. She knew the weight of those words—it was a soldier's instinct.

The scene was horrific. The jeep had been crushed, its windshield shattered like a spiderweb. The driver, his face covered in blood, weakly pointed to the back seat. "Save... the officer first..."

In the rear seat, a military officer had been impaled through the chest by a steel pipe, blood gushing from the wound. Another man lay unconscious, his arm twisted at an unnatural angle.

Luna sucked in a sharp breath. With injuries like these, every second counted...
###Chapter 162: Life or Death

"Ethan, we have to help!" Luna's voice was urgent. Her fists clenched so tightly that her nails dug into her palms. The gruesome car crash before her was impossible to ignore.

She wasn't heartless.

Even after being broken beyond repair in her past life, she was still the same Luna who couldn't bear to see innocents suffer. Exposing her supernatural ability? So what. Compared to human lives, that risk meant nothing.

Luna understood her ability's potential better than anyone. Her current healing power was far from its peak in her previous life. She remembered how exhausting it had been when she first awakened it—every use drained her completely.

The side effects had been excruciating.

But with each life she saved, her ability grew stronger. Eventually, healing hundreds in a single day became effortless. Too bad by then, she'd already been enslaved by energy suppressants, stripped of her free will.

Crash!

Ethan wrapped his jacket around his fist and shattered the driver's side window. Shards of glass sprayed everywhere as he reached in to pull the driver out.

"Leave me!" The driver gripped Ethan's wrist with bone-white knuckles. "The... the official... in the back... save him... you must save him—" With a desperate shove, he pushed Ethan away, his eyes resolute.

Ethan gritted his teeth and turned to the backseat.

The situation was dire. A steel pipe had impaled the official's chest, pinning him to the seat. Pulling it out carelessly would be fatal. But the ambulance hadn't arrived yet...

"Help the others first," the official rasped, each word a struggle. His silver-streaked temples were damp with sweat, yet he remained composed.

Luna scanned the scene. Injured people littered the platform, their moans filling the air. Her silver needles trembled between her fingers.

If she turned away now, how was she any better than those monsters from her past?

"Ethan, open it!" she ordered sharply.

Understanding instantly, Ethan's veins bulged as he wrenched the mangled car door clean off its hinges. The screech of twisting metal made the official's eyes widen in shock.

"Hold still," Ethan said, moving to the rear of the car to grip the steel pipe.

Luna nodded.

Schlick—

Blood gushed as the pipe was yanked free. The official groaned once before losing consciousness.

"You reckless fools! You'll kill him!" A nearby officer frantically pressed his coat against the wound.

Luna shoved him aside. "Move!" Her needles flashed, striking precise pressure points.

Her ability surged through the needles. The bleeding slowed, and the official's eyelids fluttered.

"You—" The officer gaped.

"Quiet!" Beads of sweat formed on Luna's brow. This time, she controlled it perfectly—stopping the bleeding without fully healing him. Saving a life without revealing her true power.

Her recent frequent use of her ability had honed this delicate balance. In the past, she'd either healed too completely or lost control entirely.

"The bleeding stopped?" Ethan rushed back after a quick assessment. "Come on, others need us."

Luna turned to the officer. "You're hemorrhaging internally. You need a needle."

"I'm fine." He stubbornly shook his head, oblivious to the blood trickling from his lips.

Luna said nothing more. She'd done her part—life and death were beyond her control now.

Working together, she and Ethan dragged the driver through the shattered window. His face was a mask of blood, his chest caved in.

"Internal injuries." Luna's needles flew. "Lay him flat!"

The siblings moved in perfect sync—Luna directing, Ethan executing. Every glance, every motion was a race against death itself.
###Chapter 163: Miraculous Healing

The accident scene was chaotic, with shattered glass scattered across the ground. Luna White crouched beside a bloodied middle-aged man, her silver needles flashing as she worked.

"The bleeding stopped!" a bystander gasped.

The man opened his eyes and grasped Luna's hand weakly. "Miss... you're an angel..."

Before Luna could stand, another man with tear-streaked cheeks grabbed her arm. "Doctor! Please save my daughter!"

Nearby, a seven-year-old girl lay unconscious, her face turning blue. The father wrung his hands. "She was eating candy when the crash happened—"

Luna darted forward. A silver needle flickered at the base of the girl's neck. The child suddenly coughed violently, expelling a sticky candy fragment.

"Incredible!" The crowd erupted in awe.

Ethan White moved to assist but was intercepted by a ponytailed woman. "Is your sister a licensed physician?"

"I—" Ethan hesitated.

"Yan Chunli, head nurse at the Military District Hospital." The woman's tone turned icy. "Practicing medicine without credentials is illegal!"

Ethan squared his shoulders. "Her skills are ancestral knowledge!"

"Preposterous!" Yan's face flushed with anger. "This isn't the Dark Ages—"

A bloodcurdling scream cut her off. A middle-aged woman convulsed on the pavement, clutching her abdomen.

Yan rushed over and paled. "Acute appendicitis! She needs surgery now!"

"Where's the ambulance?" coworkers fretted.

The woman gave a final twitch and went still.

"No pulse!" someone shouted.

As Yan prepared for CPR, Luna slipped through the crowd. Silver needles flew like shooting stars.

The woman gasped awake.

Silence blanketed the scene.

Yan's lips trembled, her medical training contradicted by this impossibility.

Luna wiped her brow. "Get her to the ER."

Sirens wailed as ambulances arrived. The lead paramedic studied Luna with undisguised curiosity before departing.

"You..." Yan struggled for words.

Luna winked. "Just family tricks."

Ethan seized his sister's hand. "You're freezing!" Her skin felt like winter frost.

"Tired, that's all." Luna licked parched lips. "Ethan, get me chocolate?"

Without question, Ethan wrapped his jacket around her and sprinted to a convenience store. He returned with fistfuls of fruit candies. "All I could find..."

The sweetness bloomed on Luna's tongue. If only she could have steaming beef noodles now... Her stomach growled audibly.

Distant sirens multiplied as reinforcements approached. Sunlight haloed Luna's pallid face, her exhaustion momentarily gilded.
###Chapter 164: The Commander

Inside the jeep, Ethan White nudged Harold Martin beside him as he stared at Luna White’s profile, her lollipop dangling from her lips. "That girl’s got skills! I thought I was done for back there, but the moment she stuck that needle in me, warmth rushed through my body. The bleeding stopped, and the pain eased up."

When no response came, Ethan turned to see Harold slumped against the seat, his lips stained with blood, his eyes rolled back—unconscious.

"Quick! Get that girl who knows acupuncture!" Ethan pounded the seat in panic.

A young soldier glanced over and nearly jumped out of his skin. Blood was still trickling from Harold’s mouth, soaking the front of his shirt.

"Miss! Help!" The soldier stumbled toward Luna. "Someone’s vomiting blood and passed out!"

Luna slowly pulled the lollipop from her mouth. "Who?"

"The—the one in the jeep!"

Grabbing her silver needles, Luna strode over, suppressing an eye roll. So much for playing tough. Now they need me?

Ethan and Clara White followed close behind. The moment Clara spotted Ethan, she gasped and snapped to attention with a crisp salute. "Commander!" Good heavens—it’s the highest-ranking officer in their military district!

Ethan waved her off. "Skip the formalities." He pointed at Harold. "Check him—he was fine a second ago. What happened?"

Twirling a needle between her fingers, Luna deliberately took her time. "I told you he had internal bleeding, but no one wanted me to treat him. Now I’ll just have to try." The moment the needle pierced Harold’s skin, he groaned.

"Get him to a hospital. Any later, and it’ll be too late." As Luna withdrew the needle, the wail of an ambulance echoed in the distance.

Ethan suddenly asked, "Girl, what’s your name?"

Luna gestured to Ethan. "My brother’s the one who saved you. His name’s Ethan White."

Ethan studied the siblings and nodded with a smile. "Both of you are impressive."

The hospital director arrived, panting, when Ethan abruptly ordered, "Take them with us to the hospital."

Luna’s heart skipped a beat. What’s this about? I didn’t slip up today, did I?

Ethan stepped protectively in front of her. "Commander, if there’s an issue, deal with me. Don’t involve my sister."

Lying on the stretcher, Ethan burst into laughter. "I just want to chat." As the medics hooked up an IV, his gaze remained fixed on Luna. "Girl, who taught you acupuncture? Your technique is seasoned."

Ethan cut in, "Family tradition. Nothing special."

"You keep speaking for your sister," Ethan teased. "Let her answer."

Luna blinked innocently. "Commander, I’m just a student. Acupuncture’s good for headaches and minor aches. Real emergencies belong in hospitals."

Ethan abruptly shifted gears. "Ever considered working for us?"

Luna smiled. "Commander, I’m here to enroll at the Aeronautical Academy. Once the paperwork’s done, I’ll be one of your soldiers."

As the ambulance siren blared, Ethan’s lips curved into a knowing grin.
###Chapter 165: The Cure in Needles

"Luna, I heard you got accepted into flight school?" Ethan frowned slightly. "That place chews people up and spits them out. The dropout rate is 70% every year—only a handful actually become pilots. The rest either get transferred to ground crew or drop out completely."

Luna blinked in confusion. "People actually drop out?" In her past life, she hadn't even set foot in a university—how would she know these details?

"Absolutely!" Ethan slapped his thigh. "Half the recruits wash out in the first year and a half of basic training alone. With your petite frame..." His gaze swept over her slender arms and legs, his words trailing off.

Ethan White broke into a cold sweat just listening. A pilot? That was absurd! He'd seen special forces training—the intensity was brutal.

"Luna..." Ethan hesitated.

Seizing the opportunity, Ethan pressed on. "Why not join our hospital? Your acupuncture skills would shine in the Traditional Medicine Department." His eyes gleamed. "Excellent pay, housing benefits, and most importantly..." He lowered his voice. "We can arrange jobs for your family."

Luna's heart skipped a beat. The offer was tempting. But...

"Sir, my acupuncture technique..." She bit her lip. "It's a family secret. I can't teach it to others."

Ethan was taken aback. "What can it treat?"

"Theoretically, anything." Luna smirked slyly. "But the results... depend on the patient's constitution. My grandfather always said traditional medicine requires intuition."

She stole a glance at Ethan. His face had darkened—clearly, the word "pilot" had shaken him.

"Maybe..." Ethan finally blurted out.

Ethan cut him off. "We'll get you certified within three months! You can apply for further studies anytime!" He rubbed his hands anxiously. "Better than washing out of flight school, right?"

Luna stifled a laugh. This man was pulling out all the stops to recruit her.

"Well..." She feigned hesitation. "I'll think about it?"

Ethan exhaled in relief. Ethan, meanwhile, grinned from ear to ear.

Only Luna knew where her heart truly leaned.
###Chapter 166: Just How Much Can This Girl Eat?

"Luna, your acupuncture skills are truly impressive. Tell me, can you relieve rheumatism and joint pain with just one needle?" Although Ethan White didn't believe in miraculous resurrections, he had to admit this girl's abilities were extraordinary.

Modern medicine often struggled with difficult cases, yet traditional Chinese medicine could work wonders. Last year, an elderly practitioner in their hospital had saved a terminal liver cancer patient with just a few herbal decoctions.

Luna licked her lollipop. "For pain relief? One needle is enough." She calculated silently—if she wanted to work at the hospital, she needed to prove her worth.

Ethan winced as his wound throbbed from his sudden movement.

Seeing this, Luna pulled out a silver needle from her pocket—a gift from her brother-in-law, Henry Cooper. Who knew it would come in handy now?

"Here, let me treat you." Before Ethan could react, the needle was already precisely inserted into the acupuncture point.

A warm current flowed through the needle, instantly easing most of the pain. Ethan sighed in relief, his eyes fluttering shut.

Luna shot her brother, Ethan White, a meaningful glance. Understanding immediately, he dug out another lollipop from his pocket, unwrapped it, and popped it into her mouth.

The nearby doctors and nurses exchanged disapproving looks. What kind of physician munched on candy while performing acupuncture? She looked more like a gluttonous child than a medical professional.

When Ethan opened his eyes and saw Luna happily sucking on her lollipop, he chuckled. "Kid, too much sugar is bad for your teeth."

"Sir, I have one condition," Luna suddenly turned serious. "Our family's acupuncture technique requires a unique energy practice, so..."

She paused deliberately, watching Ethan's expression shift before continuing, "I need a dedicated treatment room—with heating, hot water, and a steady supply of chocolates and lollipops. Also, my meals must include beef, lamb, and eggs."

A nurse nearby couldn't hold back a snort of laughter.

Ethan frowned. "That's it?"

"Don't laugh just yet." Luna extended her hand. "Shake my hand, and you'll understand."

Skeptical but curious, Ethan grasped her small hand—and his face froze.

(To be continued)
###Chapter 167: Unique Constitution

"Your hand...?" Ethan White suddenly grabbed Luna White's wrist, the icy coldness sending a jolt through him.

The delicate veins stood out against her nearly translucent skin, cold as ice.

"Each acupuncture session drains my vital energy," Luna withdrew her hand, adjusting her collar. "This innate energy I've cultivated since childhood—it's essentially trading my life to save others."

She paused, meeting Ethan's gaze directly. "So either provide me with a climate-controlled room, or limit me to one patient per day. Otherwise..." She gave a faint smile. "After treating eight or ten patients, I might not live to see tomorrow's sunrise."

Ethan's expression hardened. Having served in special forces in his youth, he'd witnessed elite soldiers who practiced hard qigong. Once their energy was depleted, even a rookie could overpower them.

This girl before him was clearly a master of such arts.

"Deal!" Ethan slapped his thigh. "The climate-controlled room will be ready tomorrow!"

Luna swiftly tucked her needles away. "Then I can start today."

"Good!" Ethan exhaled in relief, turning to his assistant. "Jack, take Dr. White to complete the paperwork."

As soon as the car stopped, Ethan was rushed into the emergency room. Jack Peterson jogged over, eyeing Luna skeptically. "You're Dr. White?"

This stick-thin girl didn't look like a miracle worker capable of saving their boss.

Before Luna could respond, Ethan interjected, "Our luggage is still at the accident site!"

Jack finally noticed the man in military uniform beside her. "And you are...?"

"My brother. Special forces," Luna said casually.

Jack's eyes lit up. "One of ours! Let's go get your things!"

As the three returned to the scene, a woman in a white coat rushed toward them. "I finally found you!"

Yan Chunli's cheeks were flushed with excitement. "I'm the head nurse at Ninth Hospital—I've been waiting here for you!"

Jack grinned. "Perfect timing. Let's go together!"

In the car, Yan leaned closer to Luna. "What brings you to the hospital?"

"My sister's joining your staff," Ethan answered proudly.

"Really? Which department?" Yan's eyes widened.

"Traditional Chinese Medicine," Luna replied with a faint smile.

Yan suddenly seized her hand. "With those acupuncture skills you showed earlier? Amazing! We'll be colleagues!"

Gazing at the passing scenery, Luna's lips curved slightly. Fate worked in strange ways. Yesterday, she was just a college-bound student. Today, she was a doctor.

As the car entered the hospital gates, Luna clenched her fist. This time, she'd make sure everyone remembered the name "Luna White."
###Chapter 168: The Healing Touch

Luna White followed Secretary Zhang hurriedly to the Ninth Hospital. The sunlight glinted off the glass façade of the building, casting sharp reflections.

"Secretary Zhang, what brings you here in person?" Director Zhang adjusted her glasses, surprise written across her face as she stepped forward. She had just received word of Leader Li Dongliang's transfer and was busy arranging a specialist consultation.

Zhang waved a hand. "Director Zhang, this is Comrade Luna White. The leader specifically requested she be assigned to the Traditional Medicine Department."

The director's gaze settled on Luna. The young woman wore simple clothes, her hair tied back in a plain ponytail. She looked no older than eighteen or nineteen, but her eyes held a steadiness that belied her youth.

"Comrade Luna, could you tell me about your professional background?" Director Zhang offered her a cup of tea.

Luna accepted it with both hands. "Director Zhang, I... didn’t graduate from medical school."

The office fell silent.

"I was supposed to report to the Aeronautical University today," Luna admitted, pressing her lips together. "But after the leader saw my acupuncture, he thought I’d be better suited here."

Director Zhang frowned slightly. The Ninth Hospital wasn’t a place just anyone could walk into.

"Acupuncture?" She studied Luna’s slender fingers. "Could you demonstrate?"

Secretary Zhang suddenly chuckled. "Perfect timing. Director, don’t you suffer from chronic rheumatism? Why not let Luna try?"

The director shot him a glare, but Luna had already pulled out her acupuncture kit, swiftly sterilizing the silver needles.

"Would you like to lie down?" Luna asked earnestly.

With a sigh, Director Zhang led them into the inner restroom. As she lay down, her heart pounded—was this girl about to use her as a test subject?

Luna’s fingers pressed lightly against the director’s swollen ankle, deformed from years of pain that flared up with every rainy day.

"It might feel warm," Luna warned, just before the needle pierced the exact pressure point.

Director Zhang’s eyes widened. A surge of warmth traveled from her sole upward, like soaking in a hot spring or having a heated towel pressed to the aching joint. The stiffness that had plagued her for years began to loosen, the pain ebbing away like a receding tide.

"This... this can’t be..." the director murmured. In thirty years of practice, she had never seen such immediate results.

Luna withdrew the needle, a faint smile on her lips. "Try standing."

Trembling, Director Zhang rose to her feet, took a few tentative steps, then stomped firmly.

"Incredible!" She seized Luna’s hands, excitement lighting her face. "Girl, who taught you this?"

Luna only smiled and pulled a lollipop from her pocket, unwrapping it slowly.

Watching this, Secretary Zhang suddenly recalled the leader’s words: "That girl is a treasure."

Outside, the wail of an ambulance grew louder. Leader Li Dongliang’s transfer convoy had arrived.
###Chapter 169: The Family Secret

"This is a White family tradition," Luna White said smoothly, repeating the excuse she'd grown almost convinced of herself.

Of course, her supernatural ability couldn't possibly have come from the Whites. Her worthless father would never have been capable of such a thing. But her birth mother... perhaps there had been something special about her. How else could this power have manifested in Luna out of nowhere?

"A family tradition? Excellent!" Director Zhang's eyes lit up. "If we could standardize your acupuncture technique, think how many veterans with old injuries could benefit. You wouldn't believe how many soldiers develop chronic conditions from years of training—rheumatoid arthritis isn't just my problem..."

Luna quickly cut off his hopeful rambling. "Director Zhang, this technique isn't for teaching. I've already explained to the General—it's not that I won't teach it, but that I can't." If people could learn this like any other skill, she thought wryly, why would I bother with this charade?

Director Zhang's expression hardened, clearly suspecting selfish motives. "Comrade White, surely in this modern era we've moved beyond keeping secrets—"

"Director Zhang," Luna interrupted firmly, "it's truly not my choice. The General can explain the restrictions. This technique has... unique requirements. Not everyone in my family could master it either."

Ethan Zhang rubbed his hands anxiously. "Little sister, give me a treatment too! This leg injury's been holding me back forever—every time we do weighted runs—"

A sudden chill ran through Luna. Her fingers turned icy.

When she didn't move, Ethan's face darkened. Was she refusing him after treating the Director?

Seeing his expression, Luna managed a weak smile. "Director Zhang, could I trouble you for a blanket?"

The older man blinked. "You need a blanket for acupuncture?"

Outside the door, Ethan White stiffened at the word "blanket." He knew that signal—his sister was about to crash.

"Luna!" He burst in and immediately grabbed her freezing hands, wrapping his military jacket around her without hesitation. "Another chill?"

Director Zhang gaped. "Comrade, it's the middle of summer—"

"I'm her brother," Ethan said tersely, fastening the jacket. "Every treatment drains her vital energy, causing hypothermia. That's why the technique can't be taught—others lack the constitution."

Skeptical, Director Zhang touched Luna's forehead and recoiled. "She's like ice!" He hastily poured hot water.

Clutching the cup, Luna popped a candy into her mouth, color slowly returning to her cheeks.

Ethan Zhang scratched his head guiltily. "Sorry, little sister. I didn't know it took so much out of you. My leg can wait—"


###Chapter 170: A Show of Power

"Let's begin now." Luna White rubbed her icy fingers together. "I doubt I'll be able to see patients after registration today. I’ve already requested that the clinic be properly heated with warming equipment available at all times." She pulled her coat tighter, teeth chattering uncontrollably. "In this state, I can only handle two or three patients a day."

Without Andrew Smith by her side, her recovery had noticeably slowed. The cold seeped into her bones, making her heart feel frozen.

Robert Thompson had no choice but to lie down on the treatment table.

Silver needles descended, and her supernatural ability flowed. Fortunately, Robert’s leg injury wasn’t severe—a recent wound that required minimal energy.

"Done."

The hospital director brought his own quilt and wrapped Luna up like a dumpling. Seeing her shivering under thick blankets in the middle of summer was pitiful.

"Mastering this energy technique must be incredibly difficult," the director mused to himself. He’d heard it took over a decade to achieve even minor proficiency—no wonder this healing method couldn’t be taught.

After a cup of hot water and a lollipop, Luna finally regained her strength. Compared to treating Nathaniel Smith, this session had been much lighter.

"I’ll arrange for someone to take you to the Traditional Medicine Department right away," the director said, his tone noticeably warmer. "The heating equipment will be installed within two days. You’ll be staying in the expert housing block, and HR will handle the rest of the formalities."

Now he understood why the senior official had sent her—she was a treasure.

Luna neatly folded the quilt and returned it to the director, then handed her coat back to her brother, Ethan White.

The HR director, Li Ran, hurried over, eyeing Luna with curiosity. Someone so young assigned to the expert housing? Her background must be impressive.

"Comrade Luna, please follow me."

Before she left, the director added warmly, "If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask."

Once Luna was gone, the director stretched his legs, amazed. "Incredible! The pain is completely gone!"

Robert jumped up and ran a lap around the office. "My leg is fully healed!" The injury that had plagued him for over a year was gone just like that.

As they marveled, a nurse rushed in—General Li had arrived.

In the intensive care unit, Li Dongliang lay with an IV drip. The moment he saw his old comrade, his first words were, "Is the girl settled? I went through hell to recruit her!"

"Don’t worry, she’s getting expert treatment," the director said, sitting down. "But won’t excessive privileges backfire?"

"Let’s observe first," Li Dongliang replied, though bedridden, his spirits were high. "Once she adjusts, we can consider sending her to medical school for further training."

"That girl gave me a show of power the moment she arrived," the director chuckled. "Two needles, and my chronic leg pain vanished."

"Cut the nonsense!" Li Dongliang glared. "She healed you, and you call it a show of power? I’ve seen her skills firsthand—"

Before he could finish, a violent coughing fit seized him, and the heart monitor screeched an alarm.

"General!" The director shot to his feet.

The door burst open—Luna stood at the threshold, silver needles glinting in her hand.

"Move!"


###Chapter 171: Special Treatment

"What? Such a thing happened? That girl didn't mention a word of it!" Dean Zhang's eyes widened in shock as he listened to Li Dongliang's account, immediately realizing how perilous the situation had been.

"That girl's medical skills are truly remarkable. You know Han Weiguo, right? We were both in danger during the car accident today. I was pinned to my seat by a steel pipe, but he had it worse—his arm was twisted like a pretzel. The worst part? When Luna tried to stop his bleeding with acupuncture, he stubbornly refused, boasting that he was fine. And then what happened?"

Li Dongliang shook his head. "He ended up vomiting blood and going into shock. Luna saved him. The hospital said he had severe internal bleeding—he's still in surgery now."

Dean Zhang patted his shoulder. "Don't worry. A promising talent like her—I’ll make sure she gets the best training."

Li Dongliang suddenly remembered Luna's special requests. If she had brought them up herself, she might have been dismissed as unreasonable.

"By the way, arrange a private consultation room for her. It should have heating, preferably with a small rest area and 24-hour hot water. And..." He paused. "Her meals should be at your standard."

"Got it, got it." Dean Zhang chuckled, cutting him off. "I’ve already looked into it. She uses qi energy for acupuncture. After treating me today, her face was pale, and she was shivering under a blanket. No wonder she rushed to eat candy the moment she arrived—she needed to replenish her energy."

Li Dongliang sighed in relief. "One more thing... She wants lollipops and chocolates as part of her benefits. Could the hospital provide some daily?"

"Consider it done." Dean Zhang stood up. "You’re injured and still worrying about everything. Get some rest. I need to make my rounds."

After Dean Zhang left, Li Dongliang suddenly remembered something and asked Zhang He, "What about Luna’s brother?"

"He escorted her to the dormitory. He should be heading back soon." Zhang He had a good impression of Ethan. "That young man is incredibly strong—he pried open a twisted car door with his bare hands."

Li Dongliang's eyes lit up. "Here’s what we’ll do—assign him to work under you for a couple of years. Both siblings are exceptional. They’re worth me sticking my neck out for."

"Don’t worry, I’ll handle it." Zhang He gave a solemn nod. "Right now, your priority is to recover."

Once the chief had settled down to rest, Zhang He quietly stepped out of the ward and instructed the secretary, "Keep an eye on the IV. Call the doctor immediately if anything happens."

......

In the HR office, Luna was filling out forms. With the dean’s special approval, the process moved swiftly.

"You can submit the photo tomorrow." The HR director collected the documents. "Li Ran, take her to the Traditional Medicine Department for onboarding."

The Traditional Medicine Department wasn’t too busy in the afternoon. Li Ran knocked on the director’s office door. "Director Wang, I’ve brought the new recruit!"

Wang Dachuan greeted them warmly, his gaze sweeping over Luna. "And this is...?"

"Dr. Luna White, from Acupuncture." Li Ran introduced her. "She’ll be working under you from now on."

Luna bowed respectfully. "Director Wang, it’s an honor. I look forward to your guidance."

Wang Dachuan nodded approvingly. The girl seemed well-mannered.

Li Ran stood to leave. "The dorm key is with me—don’t forget to pick it up." He hesitated. "Oh, and she’ll be staying in the experts’ building."

Wang Dachuan nearly dropped his teacup—the experts’ building? Even he, as a director, didn’t qualify for that!

"Wait!" He quickly grabbed Li Ran’s arm. "Stay a moment..." His mind reeled—what kind of background did this girl have?

Li Ran waved him off. "Dean Zhang’s orders. She won’t be assigned to outpatient duties yet—not until her private consultation room is ready." With that, he left swiftly, leaving a stunned Wang Dachuan behind.
###Chapter 172: Special Arrangements

As soon as Ethan White left, David Moore turned to Luna White with a beaming smile.

"Come on, I'll take you to get your work supplies," he said, his tone unusually enthusiastic.

David couldn't help but wonder. The way Robert Thompson had spoken earlier made it clear this newcomer was no ordinary hire—she had been personally placed here by Dean Zhang himself. Such preferential treatment was a dead giveaway of her connections.

Luna followed him to the Traditional Medicine Department office.

The afternoon was quiet, with only two doctors on duty.

"Director, you're here," they quickly stood up.

David gestured to Luna. "This is our new acupuncturist, Dr. Luna White. She'll be joining our department." He turned to an elderly doctor with graying hair. "Dr. Joseph Carter is our senior specialist in traditional medicine and has been overseeing acupuncture. Dr. White's arrival will help lighten the workload."

He then introduced the other two doctors. "This is Dr. Frank Harris. Dr. Harold Martin and Dr. Patrick Lewis are off duty today."

Joseph studied the surprisingly young woman before him, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. "Lisa, please take Dr. White to collect her supplies," he said to a nearby intern.

A ponytailed young woman stepped forward. "Dr. White, I'll show you to the logistics office."

Luna nodded politely to the group. "I look forward to learning from all of you."

Once she left, Frank immediately sidled up to David. "Director, that girl looks younger than my daughter. Is she really a doctor?"

Joseph sipped his tea, smiling but silent. After years at this hospital, he had mastered the art of keeping his thoughts to himself.

"Quiet!" David hissed. "This was Dean Zhang's personal arrangement. Keep your mouth shut!"

Frank shrank back, muttering under his breath, "Just another privileged rich girl here for the resume boost..."

"Listen up," David said sternly. "Make sure she's comfortable, but keep her away from critical cases. Our department is already low-key. As long as she toes the line, there won't be any trouble."

The Traditional Medicine Department at the Ninth Armed Police Hospital was essentially window dressing. Emergency cases went straight to Western medicine—their department mostly handled follow-up therapies for chronic patients.

"Right, so we're basically babysitting a porcelain doll," Frank scoffed.

Joseph remained silent, flipping through patient files with his usual smile.

Meanwhile, Luna collected two brand-new white coats and daily necessities like a washbasin and thermos from logistics. Ethan trailed behind his sister, carrying everything for her.

"Meal vouchers won't be ready until tomorrow after the paperwork's processed," Lisa explained.

Luna thanked her and asked for directions to the faculty apartments. Lisa's eyes widened slightly, but she gave detailed instructions.

At Robert's office, he had the keys ready. "This is for Unit 3, Apartment 203 in Building 5. Let me know if you need anything else."

After thanking him, Luna and Ethan headed to the faculty housing, their arms laden with bags, drawing curious glances along the way.

When they opened the door to the apartment, both siblings froze.

This was no dormitory—it was a fully furnished, modern one-bedroom apartment!

Polished concrete floors, white walls with sky-blue accents. A living room with leather sofas and a color TV, a bedroom with a double bed and wardrobe. Even the kitchen was fully equipped, complete with a brand-new gas stove.

Ethan whistled as he looked around. "This... is way beyond standard accommodations."
###Chapter 173: Farewell

Luna White pushed open the door and froze in place.

The living room gleamed with brand-new hardwood furniture, imported fruits arranged on the coffee table. Further inside, the kitchen was fully equipped with a refrigerator and washing machine. Even a state-of-the-art color television sat in the bedroom.

"This..." Her fingers trembled slightly as they brushed the television's smooth surface.

The meaningful look from HR Director Li Ran suddenly made sense. How could a junior doctor like her qualify for such luxurious accommodations?

Ethan White dropped their luggage with a loud thud.

"Luna, this place..." His voice cracked as he surveyed the room, "It's better than our regiment commander's quarters."

Luna took a deep breath, forcing composure. "Don't overthink it, brother. The hospital director must have his reasons."

She pretended nonchalance while opening the refrigerator—packed with fresh ingredients.

"Look, they even stocked groceries. When Maya visits, we can—"

Ethan grabbed her wrist. "Luna, are you really giving up university?"

She pulled away, busying herself with unpacking. "You know my medical skills. I'll get my degree in a couple years."

Her back turned to Ethan, fingers clutching her clothes so tightly her knuckles whitened.

With a sigh, Ethan began making her bed. Both silently agreed to drop the subject.

As dusk fell, Ethan's stomach growled loudly.

"Brother!" Luna whirled around. "You haven't eaten all day?"

He scratched his head sheepishly. "It's fine, I—"

"Let's eat out!" She dragged him out before he could protest.

Steam rose from the small noodle shop behind the hospital.

"Two sizzling woks with noodles, four poached eggs!" Luna slapped the table, winking at Ethan. "My treat tonight."

Before Ethan could refuse, the owner brought steamed buns. Luna pushed the plate toward him. "Eat!"

The thin-skinned buns burst with filling. Ethan took one bite before his eyes reddened.

"What's wrong?" Luna asked anxiously.

"Nothing." He wiped his face. "Just...remembering when you couldn't even afford plain steamed buns as a child..."

Luna's nose stung. She ducked her head to slurp noodles.

They devoured five bowls of noodles and four buns until stuffed.

Back at the dorm, they argued over who would take the bed.

"I'm your elder brother!" Ethan insisted.

"And I'm the host here!" Luna planted her hands on her hips.

Ethan finally surrendered, reluctantly lying on the large bed.

Late at night, Luna curled on the sofa hearing muffled sobs through the wall. She bit the quilt corner, tears soaking her pillow.

Before dawn, Ethan slipped away. On the coffee table lay a note:

"Take care, Luna. Your brother will always support you."

The handwriting blurred in spots, as if water had smudged the ink.

###Chapter 174: Awkward Moments

When Luna White woke up, sunlight already streamed through the window. Her hand instinctively reached for the other side of the pillow, but it was cold. Her brother Ethan must have left long ago.

Her gaze fell on the brand-new plum blossom watch around her wrist, and she sighed. Two days ago, Andrew Smith had secretly slipped a handkerchief-wrapped package into her bag when helping her carry it. Last night, while packing, she discovered not only the watch but also five hundred dollars and a stack of food stamps inside.

"That Andrew..." Luna bit her lip, her fingers lightly tracing the watch face. His letter had been firm, leaving no room for refusal—every word carried the tone of a fiancé laying down the law. She had wanted to refuse, but then again, she really did need a watch to keep track of time.

"I'll just pay him back later," she muttered under her breath, though the words felt ungrateful. As a small gesture, she had secretly slipped two hundred dollars to her brother Ethan. That foolish man hadn’t even saved up enough to marry.

After washing up, Luna checked the watch—ten minutes to eight. She grabbed her bag and hurried out. The Traditional Medicine Department was close to the dorm, just a five-minute walk.

Pushing open the clinic door, she found it empty except for the intern, Lily, and an unfamiliar young man cleaning.

"Good morning, Dr. White!" Lily greeted her warmly, her eyes holding a hint of reverence. After all, Luna was a licensed physician, unlike the interns.

"Where is everyone?" Luna glanced around, puzzled.

"Dr. Zhao and Dr. Fang are off today, and Dr. Han and the others probably won’t be in for a while," Lily whispered. "We don’t get many patients here, so no one’s in a rush."

Luna nodded, but her heart sank. She didn’t even have her own office, let alone a locker. She looked down at her white coat, then at the barren room, standing awkwardly in place.

"Dr. White, you can use my locker if you’d like," Lily offered, sensing her discomfort. "The interns’ changing room is next to the nurses’ station."

Grateful, Luna thanked her. As they walked down the hallway, she could feel curious eyes following her.

Inside the changing room, two young nurses were getting dressed. One of them blurted out upon seeing Luna, "New intern? You look so young!"

The air froze.

Lily quickly corrected, "This is Dr. Luna White, our new physician!"

The nurse paled, bowing repeatedly. "I’m so sorry, Dr. White! We didn’t know—"

But Luna just smiled. "It’s fine. I should have planned better." She extended her hand. "I look forward to working with you."

Her warmth put the nurses at ease, and they immediately crowded around her with questions. "How old are you, Dr. White? Which medical school did you graduate from?"

Lily broke into a sweat—everyone knew Luna hadn’t attended medical school. But before she could intervene, Luna answered calmly, "I didn’t go to medical school. I started as a rural healthcare worker."

The room fell silent for a beat.

"But medical skill isn’t about pedigree, right?" Luna blinked. "Let’s learn from each other."

Lily finally relaxed. Watching Luna surrounded by the chattering nurses, she suddenly felt that this new female doctor might just breathe some fresh life into their stagnant department.
###Chapter 175: The Air Conditioner

When Luna White followed Nurse Li back to the department, she noticed two unfamiliar faces in the examination room. A plump middle-aged woman was sorting through medical records with her head down, while a young man in his early twenties stood beside her. Luna glanced at their name tags and raised an eyebrow—Han Jian was actually a woman, while Liu Wei was indeed a young man.

"And this is?" Han Jian looked up at Luna in her white coat and turned to Nurse Li with a questioning gaze.

"This is Dr. White, the new acupuncturist from Traditional Medicine," Nurse Li introduced, her voice noticeably lacking confidence. "She'll be getting familiar with the environment these next few days..."

The two desks in the examination room were already fully occupied—there was no space left for Luna. Han Jian sized her up before suddenly smiling. "Dr. White looks quite young. How many years have you studied acupuncture?"

Luna poured hot water into her mug without looking up. "It's a family tradition. Fifteen years. I'm eighteen this year—nineteen by lunar reckoning."

"Oh, that's impressive!" Han Jian clapped exaggeratedly. "Our Dr. Zhao only studied for about a decade, didn't he?" Her tone was loaded, clearly trying to stir trouble.

Liu Wei sidled up with an ingratiating smile. "Dr. White, would you like to try my jasmine tea? Most women love the fragrance."

"Thanks, but I prefer plain water," Luna declined politely. Unsolicited kindness always made her suspicious.

"I heard they're arranging a private examination room for Dr. White?" Liu Wei's eyes darted around. "Even our department head has to squeeze in here."

Luna smiled but said nothing.

The conversation quickly fizzled out, and they all went about their business. The day dragged on endlessly for Luna—aside from a brief courtesy visit from Director Wang Dachuan, she was practically invisible. Her two colleagues were busy seeing patients, leaving her awkwardly seated in the waiting area, drawing curious glances from patients.

Fortunately, the HR department soon sent word. The moment Luna received her work ID, she rushed to the cafeteria to exchange her meal vouchers. The moment the canteen supervisor, Mr. Xing, saw the prominent "A" stamped on her slip, his attitude did a complete about-face. Not only did he serve her tea, but he even brought out his treasured Red Fuji apples.

"Dr. White, these are premium meal vouchers," Supervisor Xing said with an ingratiating smile. "Just let us know what you'd like in advance, and we'll make sure it's prepared!"

Luna thanked him and took the vouchers, fully aware that this was treatment usually reserved for the hospital director. Sure enough, over the next few days, she enjoyed specially prepared meals at every sitting, much to the envy of her colleagues.

In the department, Luna was effectively idle. Han Jian occasionally tried to cozy up to her, fishing for information about her background. The two interns took over all the prescription-writing duties, leaving Luna with nothing to do but read newspapers in the hallway.

This went on until the fifth day, when Li Ran finally took her to see her new examination room. The moment Luna opened the door, her jaw nearly dropped—the spacious two-room suite was spotless, with sealed windows, heating, and, most shockingly, a brand-new "Snow Pine" air conditioner mounted on the wall!

"Director Zhang said you'd recognize this," Li Ran said, pointing to a metal case on the desk. "Just go to Logistics when you need more."

Luna nodded with forced composure, though internally, her mind was reeling. This kind of treatment wasn't just beyond ordinary doctors—even department heads and specialists couldn't hope for such privileges. She could practically feel the countless eyes in the hospital fixed on this examination room...


###Chapter 176: The Last Patient of the Day

Luna White finally had her own consultation room.

But her days were far quieter than she'd imagined. A whole month had passed without a single patient needing acupuncture.

She'd secretly observed how Dr. Zhao Zhiguo's adjacent office was always packed. Patients with back pain queued up for his massages and acupuncture treatments. Though a few had been assigned to her, they'd take one look at her youthful face and immediately request a different doctor.

Luna sighed, twirling a silver needle between her fingers. Was she just collecting a paycheck without earning it?

Dean Zhang and that high-ranking official had gone to great lengths to recruit her, treating her like some prized artifact. And yet, after a month, she hadn't treated a single patient.

She couldn't exactly stand at the hospital entrance shouting, "I'm a miracle worker who can raise the dead," could she? That would only destroy whatever professional dignity she had left.

Days slipped by uneventfully.

The other doctors maintained polite facades, but their disdain was obvious. Who would respect someone who spent her days sipping tea and reading newspapers?

Only Liu Wei visited regularly. He'd done his homework—Luna was Dean Zhang's protégée. Even if she never lifted a finger, nobody dared complain.

Luna checked her watch. Twenty minutes until her shift ended.

She leisurely tidied her desk. After a month, she'd grown accustomed to this unhurried routine.

No need to rush.

Good wine needs no bush.

Dean Zhang was living proof. He'd come for two more acupuncture sessions this month. His chronic rheumatism had improved, and even his deformed joints were realigning.

All she needed was one opportunity—just one chance to prove herself.

"Dr. White!" Intern Li popped his head in. "I'll be done soon. Let's grab dinner at the cafeteria."

Luna nodded and was about to change when the door burst open.

"Any doctors here?" A young soldier, barely eighteen, peered inside.

Luna's eyes lit up. Was this her moment?

"I'm the doctor," she said with a smile.

The soldier immediately withdrew. Luna's smile froze. Again. Another patient scared off by her youthful appearance.

Shaking her head, she resumed packing up.

"Move! Move!" A commotion erupted outside.

Two soldiers barged in, supporting a man grimacing in pain.

"Doctor! Help our captain!"

Luna pointed to the examination table. "What happened?"

"He strained his back during drills yesterday but insisted on competing today," one soldier explained while steadying the man. "The X-ray showed he needs bed rest, but he demanded acupuncture—"

"Enough!" The captain snarled through clenched teeth. "It's just a minor injury! I have another match tomorrow! Get me your senior acupuncturist!"

Luna's heart sank. "Dr. Zhao has already left."

"What?" The man slammed a fist on the table. "It's not even quitting time!"

"Captain, please calm down!" The soldier pleaded. "Let's just go back. You need proper rest—"

Luna took a deep breath. "If you trust me, I can try. My family has practiced acupuncture for generations."

Intern Li chose that moment to return, freezing at the scene. "But we're about to clock out..."

He gave Luna a hesitant look. Everyone knew Dr. White was just for show.

Luna tightened her grip on the silver needle.
###Chapter 177: We Won't Let You Off Easy

"What nonsense are you talking? Isn't there a doctor right here?" Zhang Duo's temper flared as he was criticized.

The young soldier scoffed and pointed at Luna White. "Her? Look at how young she is. Aren't you afraid she’ll paralyze you with one wrong needle?"

The words were downright insulting.

Luna shrugged. "Fine. If you don’t trust me, have your captain come back tomorrow. There are no other doctors available now. If you want acupuncture, you’ll have to wait till morning." If they didn’t believe in her, there was nothing she could do.

She started packing up to leave.

The two soldiers moved to help Zhang Duo up.

With a sudden wave of his hand, Zhang shoved them away.

"Just—just you! Give me a couple of needles. If it can ease the pain even a little, that’s enough. This is killing me." Zhang gasped through clenched teeth. He’d had acupuncture before and knew it wouldn’t work instantly, but at least it could bring the pain down to a bearable level.

The soldier panicked. "Captain! This girl’s barely older than me. Aren’t you worried she’ll make things worse?"

Sweat rolled down Zhang’s forehead. "If she messes up, she messes up. Everyone starts somewhere. Could it possibly hurt more than this?" He turned to Luna. "Doctor, go ahead. Didn’t you say this was a family technique? Just take the edge off. Look at me—I’m sweating bullets. I’d rather die than keep feeling this."

Luna smiled faintly. "Alright. You two, help your captain onto the bed inside. Have him lie face down and take off his shirt. I’ll need to work on his back." An opportunity had fallen into her lap—she wasn’t about to let it slip away.

You’ve come to the right person, comrade.

The soldier’s eyes widened. "Captain!"

"Captain, this is reckless!"

"Am I the captain, or are you? Help me inside. That’s an order!" Zhang snapped. His back was killing him, and arguing with these two only made his mood worse.

With no choice, the soldiers helped Zhang into the treatment room, removed his shirt, and settled him face down on the bed.

Xiao Li grew nervous.

She leaned in and whispered to Luna, "Maybe have them come back tomorrow? If something goes wrong… This isn’t a joke. Hitting the wrong point could cause serious problems."

She’d seen patients who’d suffered botched acupuncture—twisted mouths, twitching fingers.

Luna might have been doubted, but she was still a real doctor. A medical mishap could cost her the job.

Even Director Zhang’s connections wouldn’t save her from that.

Luna pulled out her acupuncture kit and alcohol swabs. "Xiao Li, trust me. It’ll be fine. I won’t hurt him."

The reassurance sounded flimsy.

Unable to dissuade Luna, Xiao Li followed them in.

She resolved to be a witness—if anything happened, she could at least speak in Luna’s defense.

The two soldiers glared at Luna like she was about to devour their captain.

"Listen, doc, this is our captain. Think carefully before you act. If you’re not sure, say so now. If anything happens to him, we won’t let you off easy."

"Yeah, don’t bite off more than you can chew. Doctors have to take responsibility."

Luna smiled, wiping Zhang’s back with an alcohol swab. The cool sensation made him shiver, momentarily distracting him from the pain.

"Ignore them. Go ahead. It’s fine." Zhang wanted to glare at his men, but the pain made it impossible to even turn his head—his attempt at intimidation fell flat.

Luna nodded, giving him a thumbs-up. With trust like that, I’ll make sure you’re up and about tomorrow.

Anything less would be a waste of my ability.

Besides, you’re my first real patient at Ninth Hospital.

Director Zhang didn’t count—that was family. This was a chance to prove myself.

"Relax. I won’t paralyze your captain," Luna assured them.

Her words only made the soldiers more nervous.

Luna poised the silver needle over Zhang’s lower back, ready to insert it.

One of the soldiers suddenly blurted, "Make sure you’re aiming right! Don’t shake!"

Luna rolled her eyes. "If you keep shouting, I might actually miss. Who’s the doctor here—you or me? Your captain trusts me, but your yapping is distracting. If I slip, whose fault is that?" If she didn’t assert her authority, they’d keep treating her like a pushover.

The soldier shut his mouth but kept his eyes locked on the needle.

Two quick insertions.

Luna gently rotated the needles, her ability subtly activating.

Zhang suddenly groaned.

The soldiers panicked.

"Captain! What’s wrong? Does it hurt? I told you not to let her do this!"

"Shut up!" This time, it was Luna who snapped, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Zhang chuckled. "Doc, you’ve got skill. Those two needles—I feel heat spreading through my back. The pain’s completely gone." His earlier noise had been one of relief. After suffering for so long, the sudden absence of pain was pure bliss—only a patient would understand.

The soldiers fell silent.

If the captain said it worked, what else was there to say?
###Chapter 178: Apology

Luna White's fingers trembled, and the silver needle slipped from her grasp. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead as she spoke weakly, "Clara, quick... get me some hot water and a chocolate bar."

The two young officers exchanged puzzled glances. This didn't look like medical treatment—it seemed more like a spoiled young lady's whims.

"Putting on airs..." one of them muttered under his breath.

Before the words fully left his mouth, Robert Thompson suddenly sprang up like a fish leaping from water.

"Captain!"

"Your back injury isn't healed yet!"

They rushed forward to support him, but Robert shoved them aside. Bare-chested, he began stretching effortlessly, his movements fluid—no trace of back pain remained.

"This..." Their eyes widened in disbelief.

They knew all too well how severe Robert's chronic back injury was—normally, it would keep him bedridden for at least three days. But now...

"A miracle worker!" Robert exclaimed, flexing his limbs with delight. "Those two needles of yours worked wonders, young doctor!"

Clara stood frozen, the chocolate wrapper crinkling noisily in her grip. She stole a glance at Luna, her expression full of astonishment—could this girl really perform acupuncture?

Luna had no time to dwell on their shocked reactions. With shaking hands, she tore open the chocolate and wolfed it down, then gulped a mouthful of hot water, wincing as it scalded her tongue.

"Dr. White, thank you so much!" Robert clapped her on the shoulder with such enthusiasm that she nearly toppled over. "I'll definitely take first place in tomorrow's competition!"

Luna forced a weak smile. "Just doing my job." She discreetly rubbed her icy fingers, unable to shake the lingering chill in her bones.

The two officers flushed with embarrassment, nudging each other as they shuffled toward Luna.

"Uh... Dr. White, we're sorry about earlier..."

"We didn't recognize your skill..."

Luna waved them off. "What matters is that he's healed. Clara, pack up—we're done for the day." All she wanted now was a hot meal.

Clara swiftly gathered the medical instruments, though her gaze kept drifting back to Luna. Who would have thought her seemingly ordinary roommate had such remarkable abilities?

Before leaving, Robert boomed, "I'll send you a commendation banner soon!"

Luna shivered at the thought. Right now, what she needed wasn't a banner—it was a steaming pot of beef stew.

In the cafeteria, Clara gaped as Luna devoured an entire bowl of beef like a whirlwind.

"Aren't... you full?"

Wiping her mouth, Luna's eyes flashed with determination. What was a little cold compared to strengthening her supernatural ability? The hardships of her past life would be repaid a hundredfold in this one.
###Chapter 179: The Neighbor's Unexpected Plea

"Dr. White, your acupuncture is miraculous!" Xiao Li's eyes sparkled with admiration as she stared at Luna.

Luna continued eating, her eighteen-year-old face appearing especially youthful under the lamplight. She picked up a piece of beef and chewed slowly, savoring the warmth spreading through her stomach. It felt good—like it could melt the icy weight in her chest.

"I only know acupuncture. Nothing else," she admitted honestly.

Xiao Li waved her hands excitedly. "One skill is enough to conquer the world! If I had your talent, I could walk sideways just by doing acupuncture!"

Luna chuckled helplessly. "Go wash your clothes. The laundry room will run out of hot water soon."

Xiao Li finally remembered the pile of laundry she had neglected for a week and hurriedly finished her meal before dashing off.

Luna exhaled deeply. At least she had her first patient today. It wasn’t her preferred choice, but once there was one, there would be more.

On her way back to the dorm, she ran into the neighbor she had never spoken to before. The woman was in her forties but dressed like she was sixty—with blunt bangs, thick black glasses, and an expression that warned strangers to keep their distance.

Luna nodded out of habit and reached for her door.

"Can... can I come in for a while?" The neighbor suddenly spoke, her voice unexpectedly pleasant.

Luna turned and noticed clear shoe marks on the neighbor’s door.

"My ex-husband came to cause trouble..." The woman’s voice trembled. "He said he’d be back..."

Luna hesitated, then opened the door. "Come in."

They sat on the couch, the air awkward between them.

"I’m Luna White. I practice acupuncture in the Traditional Medicine Department."

"Lily Collins. I’m a surgeon." The introduction was stiff.

Just then, loud banging and shouting erupted outside. "Lily! I know you're in there! If you don’t open up, I’ll make a scene at your department tomorrow!"

Lily’s fingers twisted together tightly. "When we divorced, we agreed he’d get twenty dollars a month in alimony. But he always finds excuses to demand more..."

Luna understood. Another woman trapped by an ex-husband’s harassment, her own daughter even turned against her.

"This time, I don’t want to give in anymore," Lily whispered, her voice feather-light. "I’m so tired..."

Luna studied this stranger beside her and suddenly saw the unspoken sorrow etched in the wrinkles around her eyes.
###Chapter 180: Restraints

"Lily Collins, get out here right now! If you don't, I'll kick this door down and see who ends up more humiliated!" The man's arrogant shouts echoed through the hallway. Luna White peered through the peephole to see several neighbors poke their heads out before quickly retreating into their homes.

This wasn't the first time this scene had played out.

"Hiding won't solve anything," Luna turned to face Lily. The usually decisive doctor now looked like a helpless child. "He's taking advantage of your fear for your daughter to escalate his demands."

Luna couldn't help but think of her sister, Luna Whitaker. If she hadn't left the Lewis family with her children back then, she might have ended up just like...

The Lewis family should have received her "special gift" by now.

"Either fight for custody or let go completely," Luna said bluntly. "What you're doing now is supporting his entire family."

Twenty yuan was no small sum in 1985. With Lily's monthly salary barely reaching seventy or eighty, her ex-husband was clearly extorting her.

"I'm afraid..." Lily clutched the hem of her shirt. "I'm afraid he'll take it out on Phoenix when he gets home."

"But your daughter doesn't know your sacrifices," Luna shook her head. "All she sees is her father and grandmother treating her well while her own mother..."

The phone rang abruptly.

"Security? There's a disturbance at the specialists' building..." Luna reported the incident calmly.

"Don't!" Lily panicked. "This will only make things worse..."

"Worse for him!" Luna scoffed. "The more you retreat, the more he pushes. If it were me, I'd tell him he won't get another cent from now on!"

Lily paled. Only then did Luna learn that the man's family was still living in Lily's house.

"You..." Luna was speechless. This was practically inviting abuse.

The banging on the door grew louder. Luna yanked it open.

"Security is on their way," she said coldly. "Will you leave on your own, or should they escort you out?"

Frank Ferguson froze. He hadn't expected anyone to actually interfere.

"I'm her husband!" he blustered.

"Ex-husband," Luna corrected sharply. "And an ex-husband who's trespassing."

The sound of hurried footsteps came from the stairwell. Frank's face twisted, and he tried to bolt.

"Stop him!" Luna ordered. "This man is attempting extortion!"

Security officers rushed forward, cornering Frank in the hallway. His face cycled through shades of red and white.

"You wouldn't dare!" he roared weakly. "My daughter is waiting for me at home!"

Lily finally stepped out, pale but resolute. "Frank Ferguson, as of today, you and your family will vacate my house immediately."

A faint smile touched Luna's lips. The real drama was just beginning.
###Chapter 181: A Vile Scheme

Frank Ferguson's eyes bulged as he glared at the sudden appearance of Luna White.

The security team's attitude shifted instantly upon hearing her words. If they were divorced, she wasn't family—this changed everything.

"What exactly are you doing here?" The security captain scowled. "Causing trouble in the hospital in the middle of the night? Should I detain you right now? This is an armed police hospital—disturbing the peace carries legal consequences."

A chill ran down Frank's spine. He had bullied Lily Collins because he knew she valued her reputation and loved their child. But the security team wouldn’t show him any mercy.

"Comrade, I'm just here for child support," Frank immediately adopted a pitiful expression. "You don’t understand—Lily was involved with another man and insisted on divorce. Our child is still young, so I—"

The security officers' expressions softened slightly. These days, moral misconduct was a sensitive topic.

Luna suddenly let out a light laugh. "Oh, how interesting. Dr. Collins has worked here for years and never even exchanged unnecessary words with male colleagues. Meanwhile, you remarried within six months of the divorce—quite the speed."

The security team paused. Lily was famously reserved at the hospital. The idea of her having affairs was laughable.

Frank trembled with rage. "Y-you're lying!"

"I'm just a neighbor telling the truth," Luna said matter-of-factly. "Security, this man is disturbing my rest. I have work tomorrow."

Seeing that Luna lived in the specialists' quarters, the security team immediately turned on Frank. "Get out! One more word and we’ll haul you in!"

Frank had no choice but to slink away. Before leaving, he shot a venomous glare at the lit window upstairs—Lily must have been watching his humiliation.

Just wait and see!

After thanking Luna, Lily returned to her room. Luna closed the door with a sigh. This world was cruel to women.

Frank pedaled home on his bicycle, where his new wife, Maggie Lawson, was doing laundry.

"Why are you back so late?" Maggie wiped her hands, her tone sour. She feared Frank rekindling things with his ex-wife.

Frank shoveled food into his mouth as he ranted. "That bitch hid from me! A little more pressure and she would’ve coughed up the money, but some nosy busybody called security!"

Maggie’s eyes gleamed. "I say, send your mother with Phoenix tomorrow. A father asking for child support is only natural!"

Frank slapped his thigh. "Brilliant!"

After dinner, he rushed to his mother’s room in the backyard.

The old woman was about to sleep when her son barged in. "What brings you here so late?"

After hearing his complaints, the old woman’s beady eyes narrowed. "How dare she! Tomorrow, I’ll take Phoenix—let’s see if she dares refuse!"

Frank hid a smirk. His mother had been infamous in the factory for her tantrums—she’d rolled on the director’s doorstep more than once to secure his job.

Then she abruptly changed the subject. "Your brother’s wedding—you’re paying for it. Back then, he sacrificed his career for yours—"

Frank agreed outwardly but cursed inwardly. Like hell he would! If not for needing her tomorrow, he wouldn’t bother.

The old woman nodded, satisfied. "Good. Now go to bed—tomorrow, leave it to me!"

As Frank stepped out, a sinister grin spread across his face. Tomorrow, Lily would regret everything.
###Chapter 182: Defeat

Robert tore the towel from his neck and hurled it to the ground, his face dark with fury, veins throbbing at his temples.

The team members around him held their breath. No one had expected their captain to lose to Ethan—Ethan White, who hadn't ranked in the top ten for over a year. Right now, anyone foolish enough to offer consolation would likely be ordered to run ten kilometers on the spot.

"What are you all standing around for?" Robert snapped coldly. "Full gear, ten kilometers—now!"

The team's legs nearly gave out. They'd already run ten kilometers that morning, and now another round in the afternoon? With more punishment looming tonight, who could endure it? But under Robert's stormy glare, no one dared protest.

"Come on, old man," Ethan said, stepping forward and clapping Robert on the shoulder. "Taking your frustration out on your own team? Want me to run with you?"

Today was his moment of triumph. After his leg injury, he'd been overshadowed by Robert for over a year. Finally, he'd won fair and square.

Robert shot him a glare before barking at the team, "Dismissed!"

The team scattered like startled rabbits.

"You've got some nerve!" Robert punched Ethan's shoulder. "Your leg's healed, and you didn't say a word—just waited to humiliate me, huh?"

Ethan feigned pain with an exaggerated "Ow!" "I found this miracle doctor. Just two acupuncture needles, and my leg felt like it was soaking in hot water—instant relief. Don't you have that old back injury? I'll introduce you to her sometime."

"What a coincidence!" Robert's eyes lit up. "My back flared up two days ago—hurt so bad I was sweating bullets. Then I ran into this young doctor, and two needles later, the pain was gone. I was actually going to recommend her to you."

"Wait," Ethan interrupted. "Are you talking about that new doctor in the Traditional Medicine Department? The one who's barely nineteen?"

"Yeah, that's her!" Robert slapped his thigh. "Transferred here by special order from the higher-ups. Heard she's incredible."

The two men exchanged knowing grins.

"By the way," Ethan suddenly turned serious, "I'm getting transferred next year."

"Really?" Robert's eyes brightened before he quickly suppressed a smile. "Ahem—I mean, what a shame."

"Cut the act!" Ethan scoffed. "I bet you're dying to set off fireworks to celebrate!"

Robert finally cracked. "Hah! Finally free of your shadow! Come on, let's grab a drink. I've got some good liquor from the higher-ups."

Arm in arm, they headed toward the barracks.

After a few rounds, Ethan suddenly asked, "Hey, did you get that transfer order I sent you?"

"Yeah," Robert nodded. "Ethan White, right? Should be reporting in a couple of days. But your unit's not short on people—why bring someone in from out of town?"

"This Ethan White is something else," Ethan said mysteriously. "He's Dr. White's older brother. Rumor has it he's a beast in combat. Might even give me a run for my money."

"Damn!" Robert exclaimed. "Talented family, huh?"

They drank late into the night.

Meanwhile, Luna White had no idea her big brother was about to arrive.
###Chapter 183: A Chance Encounter

The train clattered along the tracks as William Cooper gazed out the window, his palms slightly damp. This was his first time traveling far from home, and his heart thrummed with a mix of excitement and nervousness.

Before he left, Iris had packed his belongings with red-rimmed eyes. At the last moment, she'd pressed fifty yuan into his hand—emergency money. Thinking of his sister's care, William instinctively touched the hidden pocket where the cash lay.

"Traveling alone, kid?"

The sudden voice snapped William out of his thoughts. Turning, he saw a middle-aged man in his forties smiling at him.

"Uh, y-yes," William answered awkwardly.

"Name's Harold Baker. Folks call me Old Harold." The man extended a hand with easy familiarity. "Judging by your look, heading to the city for work?"

William blinked in surprise. "How'd you know?"

Old Harold chuckled. "Nine out of ten young men on this train are going to the city for jobs." He pulled a greased paper package from his bag. "Here, try this—homemade braised pork knuckle."

The rich aroma of meat instantly filled the compartment. William swallowed but hesitated to take it.

"Don't be shy!" Old Harold shoved the knuckle into his hands. "We're all brothers away from home. You seem like a good kid—I like you."

Grateful, William took small bites. The meat was tender, flavorful—far better than anything he'd eaten even during New Year celebrations.

"What do you do, Old Harold?" William asked curiously.

"I run construction projects in the city. Got a crew of dozens under me." Old Harold produced two beers, handing one to William. "Went back to my hometown to recruit workers. Bringing a few locals along this time."

William's eyes brightened. "Then... are you hiring?"

Old Harold studied him. "What skills do you have?"

"I..." William flushed. "My legs aren't strong. Can't handle heavy labor..."

"Hmm." Old Harold rubbed his chin, then suddenly slapped his thigh. "Got it! We need a cook at the site. Light work, just early mornings. Room and board included—120 a month. How's that?"

William nearly dropped his beer. 120 yuan! That was a fortune back home.

"But... I'm not much of a cook," he admitted honestly.

Old Harold laughed. "That honesty's exactly why you're perfect for the job! You can learn."

Just then, a wiry young man from the row behind leaned over. "Old Harold, got room for one more? I'm a bricklayer—strong as an ox!"

Old Harold narrowed his eyes. "Name?"

"Daniel Lee, from Wang Family Hollow!" The youth eagerly pulled out his ID. "William and I are from neighboring villages."

Old Harold examined the ID, then lowered his voice. "Alright, you're in. But once we arrive, you follow orders—no wandering off."

Both nodded eagerly. Warmth spread through William's chest. He'd never expected to meet such kindness so soon into his journey.

By evening, the train pulled into the station. Old Harold led them through the crowded platform to a battered van already packed with a dozen sturdy young men.

"Hop in. Still got a ways to go," Old Harold called.

William and Daniel squeezed inside as the van rumbled out of the city. The scenery grew increasingly desolate, streetlights dwindling.

"Where exactly are we headed?" Daniel whispered.

A dark-faced man in front turned. "New development zone. Old Harold landed a big government contract."

William relaxed slightly. Watching the others doze off, he too began to drift.

Half-asleep, he felt the van lurch onto rougher terrain—a mountain road, perhaps. Forcing his eyes open, he saw only darkness outside, the vague outlines of trees.

"Almost there," Old Harold's voice came from the front. "Wake up—time to get off."

William rubbed his eyes, a sudden unease prickling his skin. This wilderness... were they really heading to a construction site?
###Chapter 184: The Sinister Mine

William Cooper was jolted awake by a sudden brake. Rubbing his eyes, he realized the vehicle had stopped.

"Woof! Woof! Woof!"

The relentless barking of dogs echoed from all directions, sending chills down his spine. William sat up straight and peered through the window to see over a dozen massive wolves circling the vehicle, their muscular frames towering over a grown man.

"Everyone out! We're here!"

The door was yanked open by a burly man with a menacing scowl. The passengers groggily grabbed their belongings and filed out. William followed behind Ethan Li, shivering as the cold wind hit him the moment he stepped outside.

Under the pale moonlight, William finally saw where they had been taken—a desolate stretch of land at the foot of a mountain. A dozen thugs armed with iron rods stood guard, while the wolves, though chained, strained violently against their restraints, making the metal links clatter.

"Where... where is this?" someone muttered under their breath.

William scanned the surroundings. There was no construction site in sight—only the dark silhouette of the mountain and the faint outline of a mine entrance in the distance. His stomach dropped as the realization hit him.

"I thought we were going to a construction site. Why are we at a mine?" a bold young man demanded.

The tattooed, bald leader smirked, rhythmically tapping an iron rod against his palm. "That's right. You're here to work. Room and board included, 200 a month—50 more than a construction site!"

The crowd stirred uneasily. William's heart pounded—this didn’t look like any legitimate job offer.

"Don’t panic," said a man called Brother Harold, stepping forward with a reassuring smile. "The work here is tough, but the pay’s good. Besides, work is work, right?"

His words calmed some, but William noticed the cold, calculating glint in the guards' eyes.

They were herded into a large stone shed. The moment the iron door slammed shut, the sound of a lock clicking into place followed. Moonlight filtered through a small window in the roof, revealing moldy straw scattered across the floor and a few disheveled miners huddled in the corners.

"William, something ain’t right," Ethan whispered nervously.

William didn’t respond. His eyes fixed on the heavy lock on the door, his dread deepening. This wasn’t employment—it was imprisonment.

Before dawn, banging erupted outside.

"Get up! Time to work!"

The miners lined up to receive helmets and headlamps. When it was William’s turn, Brother Harold suddenly stopped him. "You’re not going underground. Report to the kitchen."

Envious glances shot his way. William bowed his head in thanks, but his unease only grew.

"Brother Harold, is he family?" someone asked.

"Reminds me of my son. Couldn’t bear to send him down there," Harold exhaled a cloud of smoke. "With his build, he wouldn’t last a week in the mines."

As William was led toward the kitchen, he overheard Harold’s sigh behind him: "These days, who isn’t forced into something…?"

The mine entrance yawned like a monstrous maw, swallowing the line of workers. William glanced back, a chill running through him. A terrible certainty settled in his gut—he might never leave this mountain alive.
###Chapter 185: Life Hanging by a Thread

Luna White flipped idly through the newspaper in the silent clinic, the ticking of the wall clock the only sound. Ever since that high-profile surgery that had shaken the entire hospital, her practice had grown even quieter.

"Dr. White, have you heard?" Nurse Lily Lee whispered conspiratorially as she leaned in. "There's only one spot for advanced training at the provincial hospital this year, and our department gets just one."

Luna didn’t look up. "It won’t be me."

She knew better. Having only been here for two months, if the opportunity went to her, the senior doctors would raise hell.

Just then, a heart-wrenching scream echoed down the hallway. Luna’s ears perked up—it was coming from Dr. Zhao Zhiguo’s office.

"You quack! If anything happens to my daughter, I’ll make you pay!"

Hesitating for only a second, Luna set the newspaper aside and stepped out. Before she could reach the door, a man in military uniform yanked her inside.

"Doctor, help her!"

Luna looked down. A girl of about seven or eight lay on the examination table, her face cyanotic, her chest still. Luna pressed her fingers to the child’s wrist—her heart sank.

"No pulse."

The emergency team rushed in, but after a few minutes of futile efforts, the lead doctor shook his head. "Prepare for the worst."

The mother lunged at Dr. Zhao like a wild animal. "Give me back my daughter! It was just asthma—how could it kill her?"

Luna stood frozen—until she noticed the faintest flutter of the girl’s nostrils. She sprang forward. "Wait! She’s still breathing!"

"What are you doing?" the mother shrieked.

Ignoring her, Luna pushed through the crowd and seized the girl’s wrist. Her supernatural ability surged through her fingertips—but the child’s body was already cold, the energy dissipating like water into sand.

"It’s the death rattle," the emergency doctor murmured. "Once that breath fades, she’ll—"

Before he could finish, the girl convulsed, coughing violently—a spray of black blood splattering across Luna’s white coat.

The room fell deathly silent.
###Chapter 186: The Healer's Heart

Luna White dashed forward. The moment her fingers touched the child's neck, her heart skipped a beat—there was still a faint pulse!

Without hesitation, she yanked the white sheet off the child. Thoughts of exposing her supernatural abilities or self-preservation vanished. All that remained was a dying child, and she had the power to save them.

"Move aside!" she barked.

Dean Zhang's face darkened. This intern had gone too far! The family was already distraught. If things escalated, the hospital's reputation would be ruined.

"Luna! Step back now!" His voice carried unquestionable authority.

The child's mother collapsed, her legs giving way. Medical staff scrambled to lift her onto a bed as the heart monitor blared an alarm, throwing the emergency room into chaos.

"Dean, the child can still be saved!" Luna pressed her fingers firmly against the child's wrist. "There's still time for acupuncture!"

Whispers spread among the surrounding doctors. "She's desperate for fame," someone muttered.

Dean Zhang trembled with rage. Acupuncture to save a life? Ridiculous! Even master physicians wouldn’t make such a claim, let alone this inexperienced girl.

"Luna, you're fired!" he roared. "Security! Remove her!"

Luna didn’t budge. Her gaze burned into the child's pale face. In her past life, she had lived as a tool. Would she cower again in this one?

"Captain Zhang!" She turned to the officer nearby. "Give me five minutes. Just five!"

Captain Zhang Duo frowned. As a special forces leader, he'd witnessed countless life-and-death moments. The determination in this young doctor's eyes reminded him of battlefield medics who fought to save lives against all odds.

"Are you sure?" he asked gravely.

Luna nodded without hesitation. "I swear on my grandfather's medical oath."

Dean Zhang exploded. "She’s no longer employed here! The hospital bears no responsibility!"

With a cold laugh, Luna ripped off her white coat and let it fall to the floor like a broken-winged butterfly.

"Now, I’m just a passing traditional healer," she said slowly. "Captain Zhang, the choice is yours."

The emergency room fell silent. Every eye fixed on Zhang Duo.

Beep. Beep. The heart monitor’s rhythmic beep cut through the tension.

Zhang Duo stared at the child’s blue-tinged lips and remembered his fallen comrade. If only someone had given him one more minute back then...

"Do it!" he snapped. "I’ll take full responsibility!"

A flash of silver flickered at Luna’s fingertips. Before anyone could react, three needles pierced precise points on the child’s body.

"Everyone out!" she ordered without looking up. "One nurse stays."

Dean Zhang moved to intervene, but Zhang Duo’s glare froze him in place. The special forces team swiftly cleared the room, leaving only Luna and a young nurse.

As the door closed, a faint white glow emanated from Luna’s palm...


###Chapter 187: A Doctor's Compassion

"Step forward!" Zhang Duo's command struck like thunder, igniting a spark of hope in Dr. Zhao's eyes as he slumped on the floor.

At last, he could be free.

It wasn’t that he lacked compassion—he simply couldn’t bear the responsibility. With only three months left until retirement, a disciplinary action over this medical mishap would cost him not just his job, but his pension. His paralyzed wife and college-bound grandson depended on him.

When faced with life and death, self-preservation is human instinct.

Dr. Zhao shut his eyes in anguish, guilt weighing heavy on his conscience—yet relief washed over him.

Without hesitation, Luna White retrieved a silver needle from her bag. "Alcohol swabs," she said calmly.

The ward fell deathly silent. No one dared move.

Assisting Luna now meant defying the hospital director.

"H-Here." A trembling voice came from the back. Intern Lily Li pushed forward, hands shaking as she held out the disinfectant supplies. Despite her fear, she stood firmly beside Luna.

Luna gave her a faint smile. She didn’t blame the others. Having worked here only three months, she barely knew anyone except Lily. This small act of support was enough.

"Luna!" Director Zhang suddenly spoke. "Do you understand the consequences of this?"

Luna didn’t look up. "Director, we’re doctors. If we hesitate to save lives over consequences, what’s the point of our oath?"

The words struck like a hammer, jolting Director Zhang’s heart. Thirty years ago, fresh out of medical school, she too had acted without hesitation. When had she grown so cautious?

"Wait!" Director Zhang called out.

Luna paused, the needle glinting coldly in her fingers.

Director Zhang removed her own white coat and draped it solemnly over Luna’s shoulders. "From now on, you represent Ninth Hospital. Dr. White, you’re doing the right thing."

Scattered applause broke out, growing louder until it filled the ward.

Dr. Zhao Zhiguo slumped to the floor in defeat. He had lost—to a rookie. In the face of true medical ethics, his pride in his skills meant nothing.

Luna took a deep breath and steadied the needle, inserting it precisely into the child’s pressure point. The room was so quiet, breaths could be heard.

Lily suddenly rushed out, returning with a cup of warm sugar water and a chocolate bar, standing silently nearby.

Ten minutes later, Luna withdrew the needle, her face ghostly pale, her body swaying. Zhang Duo caught her, shocked by how icy her hands felt.

"Uncle Zhang?" A weak voice came from the bed.

Everyone froze.

The little girl’s eyes fluttered open, confused.

"She’s awake! She’s really awake!" Someone shouted, and the ward erupted. Doctors and nurses embraced, some even crying.

Dr. Zhao clapped hard, the applause spreading like wildfire from the ward to the hallway, thundering through the entire Traditional Medicine Department.

"Run tests!" Director Zhang ordered, eyes red. Medical staff swarmed the bed.

The little girl, frightened by the commotion, burst into tears. "Mommy! I want Mommy!"

A woman shoved through the crowd, clutching her child. "Niu Niu! My baby!"

"Mommy, no more needles..."

"No more, never again," the mother sobbed, holding her tighter.
###Chapter 188: A Debt Beyond Repayment

"Dr. White! Drink some hot water!" Xiao Li rushed to Luna's side, thrusting a steaming enamel mug and a chocolate bar into her hands. Ever since witnessing Luna's weakened state after performing acupuncture, she had been extra attentive. Over the past few days, she had noticed a pattern—each time Luna used her needles, she would grow deathly pale, her hands and feet icy cold.

Luna's trembling fingers accepted the mug. The scalding liquid slid down her throat, thawing her frozen tongue.

"Let me." Dean Zhang, seeing her struggle to unwrap the chocolate, took it from her and peeled it open before handing it back.

"Thank you, Dean."

"Eat quickly. Should I have someone escort you back to your office? The heater's still on." It suddenly dawned on Dean Zhang why Luna had insisted on that particular office—it was for moments like this.

Just as the chocolate touched her lips, Luna staggered from a sudden impact.

"Savior!" The mother dropped to her knees, clutching her child, her forehead thudding against the floor. "You saved my baby's life! From now on, you're our family's guardian angel! When my child grows up, I'll make sure they repay your kindness!"

Luna tried to help her up but found her back too stiff to bend.

"Help her!" she urged Xiao Li frantically.

Dean Zhang and Xiao Li lifted the woman to her feet.

"Ma'am, saving lives is our duty as doctors. Right now, your child needs to be checked—medication or injections, whatever's necessary." Luna's voice shook. She had pulled the child back from death's door and couldn't bear to see her efforts wasted.

Medical staff whisked the child away to the emergency room. The woman chased after them for a few steps before turning back. "Doctor, what's your name? My child must know who to thank!"

"Just call me Dr. White."

"Dr. White... Dr. White..." The woman murmured the name as she disappeared down the hall.

Only then did Luna realize the cold was seeping from her bones, her teeth chattering uncontrollably. To avoid suspicion, she had deliberately restrained her supernatural ability, using just enough to save the child. But the restraint had drained her more than expected, leaving her utterly spent.

"Get Dr. White back to her office now!" Dean Zhang stamped his foot in urgency.

Before Xiao Li could move, a tall figure stepped forward and steadied Luna.

"Can you walk?" Zhang Duo frowned at her paper-white face.

Luna shook her head. "I'm fine. Please check on the child." She knew Zhang Duo's back injury had long healed—his visit today had another purpose.

"I came to deliver a commendation plaque," he said quietly. "'Miracle Worker' seems too small a praise now. In a few days, I'll bring my entire team to thank you properly." With that, he strode after the mother and child.

Back in her office, Xiao Li cranked the heater to its highest setting. Waves of heat rolled out, and within minutes, sweat poured down her face.

"I can't take this!" Xiao Li yanked at her collar and bolted for the door—nearly colliding with a man outside.

"Who are you looking for?" She eyed the broad-shouldered man in his crisp military uniform and gleaming insignia. Clearly, he was no ordinary visitor.

"I'm here for Luna White." Andrew Smith lowered his raised hand. He had just been transferred to the provincial capital and had scoured records to track her down. Today, he'd taken leave specifically to find her—only to be met with a closed door.

"Dr. White isn't seeing patients today." Xiao Li planted herself firmly in the doorway. After witnessing the life-saving ordeal, Luna had ascended to sainthood in her eyes. No one was disturbing her rest.
###Chapter 189: A Fateful Encounter

"I'm not here for a consultation," Andrew Smith said with a faint smile, his voice deep and steady.

"Then you must be..." Lily tilted her head in confusion before suddenly realizing. "Oh! Are you Dr. White's brother, Ethan?"

Andrew shook his head gently, his gaze warm yet firm. "I'm Luna White's fiancé. Andrew Smith."

"Fiancé?!" Lily nearly jumped in shock. Dr. White had never mentioned having a military instructor for a fiancé!

"Is she inside?" Andrew's eyes shifted toward the examination room door.

Lily nodded dumbly.

Andrew pushed the door open.

The moment it closed, he saw Luna curled up beneath the air vent, shivering under a thick blanket. She had just barely managed to swallow a piece of chocolate but lacked the strength to even lift a glass of water, her fingers stiff with pain.

Only one thought consumed her: Andrew. The man who always knew how to warm her up instantly. If he were here, he would hold her tight, his scorching body heat driving away the chill in her bones.

But how could that be? They had long lost contact.

Just then, she jerked her head up—and there he was, standing right in front of her!

Luna blinked, certain she was hallucinating. She distinctly remembered they hadn’t even exchanged full addresses. How could he possibly—

"Luna!" His steady voice was like a shot of adrenaline. "I'm here. You're safe now."

Tears spilled over instantly. She wiped her face clumsily with the blanket, but an overwhelming joy surged through her.

Andrew locked the door decisively, scooped her up—blanket and all—and strode into the inner examination room. Luna wriggled free of the covers and clung to him like a koala.

"How long?" he asked, frowning.

"Just finished seeing a patient..." She greedily absorbed his warmth, feeling her frozen blood begin to thaw.

Andrew wrapped them both in the blanket, one hand cradling the back of her head against his neck while the other rubbed her icy feet. His body temperature was alarmingly high, and Luna felt like she might melt into him.

"Don't cry," he murmured, using the blanket to wipe her tears.

Luna noticed beads of sweat on his forehead.

"You're sweating?" she asked weakly.

"It's like a sauna in here," he whispered against her ear. Truthfully, he didn’t care about the heat—as long as it warmed her.

Gradually, the only sounds left in the room were their breathing and the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. Luna hazily recalled how many times he had held her like this before.

Then a sobering thought struck her: How am I going to explain why we have to get married now? I can’t just keep taking advantage of him like this...

Her fingers absently traced the firm lines of his chest, the powerful muscles evident even through his clothes. The man was unfairly fit, completely unaware of how irresistible he looked right now.

"Warm now?" he asked suddenly, pressing a light kiss to her forehead.

Luna nodded, then remembered the crucial question. "Why are you here? Your base is in..."

"Transfer orders," he cut in, dispelling her worry. "I'm stationed in the neighboring province now. Only a twenty-minute drive." He chuckled. "Who knew we were this close? Took me over a month to find you."

Luna exhaled in relief, her body relaxing. This must be fate.

"Speaking of which," she mumbled against his shoulder, "after I saved that official, I was assigned here. It's not that I didn’t want to contact you, but..."

"I know," he said, tightening his hold. "But I found you now. That’s what matters."

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting dappled patterns on the floor. In the quiet, their hearts drew closer—as if this meeting had been written in the stars.
###Chapter 190: I'm Serious Too

"You mentioned a job transfer before, but I never imagined it would be here. What a coincidence." Luna White's eyes widened in surprise. She hadn't expected Andrew Smith's transfer to be arranged like this.

Yet, a strange feeling stirred in her chest. What if she hadn’t come to this province?

Something didn’t quite add up.

Andrew chuckled and ruffled her hair. "I requested the transfer after finding out you were coming here for school. There’s no such thing as coincidence." He wasn’t the type to hide his intentions, especially when it came to something this important.

Luna pressed her face against his chest like a child seeking comfort, trusting him completely.

"Andrew, I want to take it back!"

His entire body stiffened at her words, muscles tensing instantly. Sensing his reaction, Luna patted his shoulder reassuringly.

"Take what back?" His voice turned noticeably rigid.

"Guess." She teased him deliberately, though her heart swelled with warmth. His concern for her satisfied her feminine pride in a way she hadn’t expected.

"Playing with me?" His deep eyes locked onto hers.

Luna suddenly felt guilty.

This version of Andrew made her hesitate to joke further. His seriousness reminded her that he wasn’t like Frank Harris or any of the other men who had tried to win her favor. He was genuine—and her flippant attitude just now had been unfair.

"Andrew, I don’t want to let you go. I’ve decided I’m keeping you forever. You can only marry me." The words spilled out impulsively, startling even herself. Maybe it was the intensity in his gaze that made her speak without thinking.

His hand suddenly clamped around her wrist, the grip so tight she stumbled forward, crashing into his chest.

She tried to push away, but he only held her tighter.

Seeing her flustered expression, Andrew relaxed. She wasn’t indifferent to him—that realization lightened his mood. His arms tightened around her as he murmured in her ear, "I’d be happy to marry you. The marriage application has already been submitted. It should be approved soon."

Luna’s face flushed instantly. "How could you? You didn’t even ask me!" Her agreement was one thing, but him making decisions without consulting her was another.

Andrew released her, frowning when he saw the red marks his grip had left on her delicate skin. "You bruise too easily."

This girl was as fragile as a flower, yet stronger than anyone he knew.

"Don’t grab me like that again," she warned, holding up her wrist to make him feel guilty.

"Sorry." Andrew’s resistance crumbled completely.

Luna reached for her shoes under the blanket, but Andrew stopped her, kneeling to slip them on for her. "Not cold anymore?" He couldn’t help worrying—every time he saw her, she seemed to be in some kind of trouble.

She nodded and stood, wiping sweat from her forehead. "No wonder you said it was hot as a desert in here. I’m sweating." The room was unbearably stuffy.

Andrew turned off the AC and opened the window before swiftly folding the blanket into a perfect square—so fast it left Luna gaping.

"Let’s eat. It’s already noon. If you keep exhausting yourself like this, what will you do in the future?" His tone carried undisguised happiness. The mutual understanding between them confirmed that Luna felt the same way he did.

This feeling of reciprocated affection was damn near perfect.

Luna felt a little embarrassed. Men like Andrew—so attentive and gentle—were rare in this era. And the fact that he had such a cold, reserved face only made the contrast more striking.

"It’s fine. I had hot water and chocolate. The child’s condition was just too severe. Next time, I’ll be more careful. If it happens again, I’ll just come to you for warmth." She found it strange—this time, with Andrew beside her, the cold had faded much faster than usual. Normally, hot water and chocolate barely helped. She knew the side effects of forcibly stopping her ability had worsened. Thank goodness Andrew was here—he was like her personal savior.

Andrew watched as she removed her white coat and put on her jacket. November was freezing, so he carefully buttoned it up for her.

"Luna, there’s something I need to make clear. You still have a chance to back out now. But once we start, I won’t let go. I’m stubborn—when I commit to someone, it’s for life."

She met his gaze, her fingers lightly resting on his hand. "Andrew, I’m serious too. I’m just as stubborn. If I say it’s starting, I won’t think about ending it. But if you ever betray me..." Her eyes turned sharp. "I’ll kill you. My love is demanding—it doesn’t tolerate even a hint of betrayal. Do you still dare to take me as I am?"

In this second life, she could show mercy to her patients because life was precious. But marriage and love were different. The wounds Frank Harris had inflicted in her past life ran too deep—she wouldn’t make the same mistake again. If anyone dared to hurt her, she wouldn’t hesitate to retaliate in the most extreme way. After all, she had the power to do so.
###Chapter 191: The Challenges of a Soldier's Wife

"I won't make vows because I think they're hollow," Andrew Smith said, gripping Luna White's hand so tightly it made her wince. "How many men have broken their promises after swearing them? I'd rather show you with actions. From now on, you, Luna White, are my only wife and the mother of my children."

Luna leaned against his chest, breathing in the faint scent of tobacco on his clothes. For the first time, she realized a heartbeat could feel this steady.

"Luna," Andrew murmured, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. "That's what I'll call you from now on. Only me."

A loud growl interrupted the moment.

Luna flushed and looked up. "I'm hungry."

Andrew chuckled, ruffling her soft hair. "Let's eat."

Their eyes met, and the air between them seemed to shimmer with sweetness.

As the clinic door opened, Nurse Lily peeked out cautiously. Seeing Luna smiling brightly with Andrew's arm around her, she finally relaxed.

"Lily, join us for lunch," Luna offered.

Lily shook her lunchbox. "No need—I already grabbed mine." She wasn't about to play third wheel.

Andrew gave an approving nod. The girl had good sense.

"Who's that with Dr. White?" another nurse, Grace, whispered.

"Her fiancé!" Lily gushed. "He's a battalion commander—handsome and devoted. Dr. White hit the jackpot!"

Grace's expression dimmed. "Being a soldier's wife isn't easy..."

"I know," Lily sighed. "My brother's in the military. Without our parents helping, my sister-in-law struggles raising kids alone while farming. Dr. White will—"

"Food's getting cold," Grace cut in.

The cafeteria was nearly empty. Section Chief Xing nodded briefly at Luna before returning to his meal with the cooks. His attitude had cooled ever since learning she had "connections."

Luna led Andrew to the serving line, nodding awkwardly at the constant greetings from strangers.

"Seems you're quite popular," Andrew teased in a low voice.

Luna shot him a look. "It's because of you!"

His tall frame and military uniform drew attention wherever he went. Luna suddenly realized this would be her life now—always in the spotlight.

"Regrets?" Andrew breathed near her ear.

She shook her head, but whispers reached them:

"They say soldier's wives suffer..."
"My cousin married a company commander—she barely sees him..."
"Dr. White seems so delicate. How will she manage?"

Andrew's grip tightened. Luna tilted her head up with a sweet smile, mouthing, "I'm not afraid."

His eyes darkened. Abruptly, he pulled her toward the exit.

"No lunch?" Luna asked, startled.

"Let's eat at home," Andrew said roughly. "I want to hold you properly."

Her ears burned. She knew their future held more than just sweetness—there would be long separations and endless waiting. But for now, she only wanted to lose herself in the warmth of his arms.
###Chapter 192: Cafeteria Incident

Luna White paid no mind to the stares around her. She had come to the hospital to save lives, not to please anyone.

Andrew Smith insisted on accompanying her to the cafeteria. Unable to dissuade him, Luna reluctantly let him tag along.

"Sorry, Dr. White," the cafeteria lady said apologetically. "All we have left are a few stale buns and half a plate of shredded potatoes." She glanced furtively at Director Xing, who sat in the corner, showing no reaction.

Luna sighed at the yellowed buns and meager portion of potatoes in her tray. This wouldn’t be enough for two people.

"Let’s eat outside," she whispered, tugging Andrew’s sleeve.

Andrew frowned at the pitiful leftovers. Was this what his girl had to endure at the hospital?

"Luna," he murmured, leaning closer, "should I pull some strings to transfer you to another hospital?"

She laughed softly. "I just got here. This is nothing." Rising on her tiptoes, she added in his ear, "Besides, I’m going to be the director here someday. Running away now would be cowardly."

Andrew chuckled, but before he could reply, a booming voice interrupted them.

"Dr. White! Where are you off to?"

Director Zhang strode over, his sharp gaze flickering between them.

"This is my fiancé, Andrew Smith," Luna introduced. "The cafeteria’s out of food, so we’re heading out."

Director Zhang’s expression darkened. "You have top-tier meal vouchers and still can’t get a proper meal? Come with me!"

Seeing the situation turning sour, Director Xing hurried forward. "Director Zhang! I’ll have the kitchen whip up some specialties for you right away!"

"Make sure Dr. White gets a proper meal too!" Zhang slammed his hand on the table. "Five dishes—now!"

Sweat beaded on Director Xing’s forehead as he nodded frantically. "Right away! Dr. White, just name what you’d like!"

Luna smiled sweetly and listed a few dishes, adding pointedly, "And double the beef stew with potatoes."

Andrew squeezed her hand, amused by the mischief in her eyes. His girl wasn’t one to be trifled with.

The kitchen erupted into chaos. Director Xing personally oversaw the preparations, inwardly cursing his misjudgment. He’d seriously underestimated her.
###Chapter 193: Clearing the Air

Chief Xing fumbled about in a flurry, sweat rolling down his forehead.

The kitchen staff had long abandoned their meals, scrambling to keep up—some washing vegetables, others chopping meat, and a few tending the fire. Who dared sit and eat now?

"Hurry up! Move faster!" Chief Xing stomped his foot in frustration, regret gnawing at him.

He should have known better. How many people in the entire hospital were worthy of Luna White’s top-tier meal privileges?

Yet he’d listened to the gossip, dismissing her as just another privileged outsider here for superficial credentials.

Now, he’d stepped right into trouble.

With seven or eight people working at once, they soon prepared five dishes, a soup, and steaming white rice.

"Dean Zhang, Dr. White, please see if this suits your taste." Chief Xing personally served the meal, even adding two braised pork trotters. "Fresh out of the pot—please enjoy."

Dean Zhang gave him a pointed look. "Chief Xing, Dr. White is our hospital’s treasure. The general went to great lengths to bring her here. You mustn’t neglect her."

"Yes, yes, of course!" Chief Xing nodded eagerly. "Dr. White, just tell me what you’d like to eat from now on, and I’ll arrange it myself!"

Luna couldn’t help but laugh. "Chief Xing, are you trying to fatten me up like a pig?"

The remark drew chuckles from everyone.

"You flatter me, Dr. White." Chief Xing wiped his brow. "If you lose weight, the dean will have my hide."

Dean Zhang burst into laughter. "Good, you understand!"

Once Chief Xing tactfully excused himself, Dean Zhang served Luna himself. "Eat while it’s hot."

Luna didn’t hold back—she needed the energy.

"Dr. White, about today..." Dean Zhang suddenly turned serious. "I owe you an apology."

Luna paused, chopsticks mid-air.

"What do you mean?"

Dean Zhang sighed. "After years as dean, I’ve considered too many things—the hospital’s reputation, various interests... but I forgot the fundamental duty of a healer."

Luna’s heart clenched.

"Seeing you today reminded me of how I was when I first became a doctor." Dean Zhang’s eyes gleamed. "Young people like you are the future of medicine."

Luna’s eyes grew warm.

Suddenly, she understood the meaning behind her choice.

Not just for revenge. Not just for family.

But for... all those who needed her.

"Dean Zhang, you honor me too much," she said softly. "We’re all still learning."

Outside, the sunset’s glow stretched their shadows long across the floor.
###Chapter 194: Hospital Turmoil

"Director, I just want to focus on being a good doctor. Nothing else matters to me," Luna White set down her chopsticks, her gaze clear and sincere.

Director Thompson placed a piece of braised pork on her plate. "I can see that. You have the compassion that defines a true healer."

The scene of Luna saving a patient in the hallway earlier had not only moved Director Thompson but also touched every doctor in the hospital. Her selfless dedication to saving lives struck a chord deep within everyone.

"If you keep praising me, I won’t be able to finish this meal," Luna teased with a smile. Since her reincarnation, this was the first time she had felt such paternal warmth, and it brought a quiet comfort to her heart.

Andrew Smith silently ladled a bowl of soup for her.

"Alright, I’ll stop. But you need to eat more. Every time you perform acupuncture, it looks like it takes half your life," Director Thompson said, his eyes filled with concern as he studied her thin face. "If there’s anything special you’d like from the cafeteria, just let me know. I’ll have the chef prepare it for you."

Luna playfully blinked. "Then I’d better eat my fill now, or I might get scolded for having a big appetite when I marry into the family later."

Andrew remained expressionless but added another piece of fish to her plate.

"Luna, where are you from? Do you have any family left?" Director Thompson suddenly asked, his gaze thoughtful.

"Six Paths Village. My parents are gone. Just my older brother and sister remain," Luna answered frankly.

"Were your parents doctors too?"

"Yes, rural physicians," Luna replied smoothly, weaving her story. "Our family’s acupuncture technique requires innate talent. It might skip a dozen generations before finding a successor. My father said I was lucky—I practiced on them since I was little. I’ve probably broken enough needles to fill a basket."

Director Thompson paused mid-bite. "Six Paths Village? What was your mother’s name?"

"Mary White." Luna noticed the subtle shift in the director’s expression.

Just as the atmosphere grew tense, Chief Xing rushed in, flustered. "Director, we have a problem! Dr. Collins’ mother-in-law is causing a scene in the outpatient hall. The old woman is lying on the floor!"

"What happened?" Director Thompson stood immediately.

"She’s accusing Dr. Collins of not giving her living expenses. The crowd has blocked the entire hall!"

Luna’s heart skipped a beat—Lily Collins?

"I’ll handle it." Director Thompson strode out.

Andrew caught Luna’s arm as she moved to follow. "Stay out of trouble. Why don’t you show me your dorm instead?"

"It’s almost time for my shift," Luna glanced at her watch. "When do you report back to base?"

Andrew’s eyes lingered on the watch at her wrist, a faint smile in his gaze. "Give me your number. I’ll call ahead next time."

They exchanged contact information. Luna noticed his handwriting—strong and precise—and raised an eyebrow. "You’re well-educated?"

"High school graduate." He checked his watch. "I should go."

After seeing Andrew off, Luna turned and sprinted toward the outpatient hall. She had to see what was happening with Lily. After all, that "terrible idea" had come from her.
###Chapter 195: The Wretched Often Deserve Their Fate

Luna White froze the moment she stepped into the outpatient building.

The first-floor lobby was packed with a noisy crowd, the clamor hitting her like a wall. Director Zhang hadn’t exaggerated—this was louder than a marketplace.

"That heartless Lily Collins—!"

A shrill, theatrical wail cut through the din. The voice had that unmistakable rhythm of a professional complainer, rising and falling like a bad opera performance.

Luna’s eyebrow twitched. Why did that sound so familiar?

It was a carbon copy of her grandmother, Clara White.

"Director, you must stand up for us!" The old woman sobbed dramatically, wiping snot on her sleeve. "Lily abandoned her own daughter! My granddaughter is only twelve—she needs food, she needs school! And that wretched mother of hers won’t give her a single penny!"

Pushing through the crowd, Luna saw Director Zhang desperately trying to coax the woman to stand.

Lily stood nearby, her white coat half-torn, red marks streaking her face. She kept her head bowed like a scolded child.

"Let’s discuss this in my office," Director Zhang muttered under his breath.

The old woman planted herself more firmly on the floor. "No! We’ll settle this right here! Let everyone see the truth!"

Then a ponytailed girl burst forward and shoved Lily hard.

"Stop pretending to be innocent!" the girl shrieked. "Dad asked you for child support three times, and you ignored him every time!"

The crowd erupted.

"She won’t support her own child?"
"How can someone like this be a doctor?"
"The hospital needs to answer for this!"

Lily opened her mouth, but no words came out.

Luna watched the spectacle with cold detachment. Pitiful? More like despicable.

She turned to leave—only to feel a tug on her coat.

Glancing back, she saw the old woman using her white coat as a handkerchief.

"Let go." Luna’s voice was ice.

The woman finally realized she’d grabbed the wrong person and awkwardly released her grip.

The crowd burst into laughter.

Expressionless, Luna brushed off her coat and walked away without a backward glance.

Family drama like this? Whoever got involved would only regret it.
###Chapter 196: The Saintly Woman

The elderly woman suddenly realized she was clutching a white lab coat in her hand.

"Fine, I'll let go! How dare you disrespect your elders like this?" the old woman snapped preemptively, afraid the doctor might call her out for wiping her nose on the coat.

Luna White turned and gave her a cold glance. "Respect? For someone like you? I don’t even know where to begin. Shouldn’t you be ashamed, throwing a tantrum at your age?"

Her gaze shifted to the cowering little girl beside the woman. "And you dragged your twelve-year-old granddaughter into this? Anyone would think she’s your enemy, not your flesh and blood. Screaming at her own mother like that—I suppose you taught her that too?"

With that, Luna turned to leave.

The old woman panicked and grabbed Luna’s leg. "You little brat! You must be in cahoots with Lily Collins! What’s wrong with me raising my own granddaughter? You’re not going anywhere until you explain yourself!"

The crowd murmured disapprovingly.

"Apologize, young doctor!"
"Why meddle in family matters?"

Lily Collins rushed forward. "Dr. White has nothing to do with this. Grandma, if it’s money you want, I’ll give it to you."

The old woman smirked in triumph. Her former daughter-in-law was still so easy to manipulate.

"From now on, you’ll give Phoenix 30 yuan a month for living expenses. She’s growing up—costs add up," the old woman declared, tightening her grip on Luna’s leg.

Lily paled. Her monthly salary was only 60 yuan—20 went to her parents. If she gave away another 30, she wouldn’t even have enough to feed herself.

Seeing Lily hesitate, the old woman wailed dramatically, pounding Luna’s leg. "No justice in this world! The hospital is bullying the old and the young!"

Luna almost laughed. This woman had even less shame than Clara White.

"If you’re so pitiful, then let me handle this," Luna said loudly. "Dr. Collins is struggling, and we all understand if your son can’t afford to raise his daughter. So here’s a better idea—"

She paused deliberately. "Send the girl back to Dr. Collins, and your son can pay 30 yuan a month in child support. Dr. Collins will make sure she’s well-fed and properly clothed—unlike now, with her sleeves practically up to her elbows."

The crowd erupted.

"Raising a child takes two people!"
"60 yuan a month? That’s what a whole working-class family lives on!"
"Where’s all the money going? Look how short her clothes are!"

The old woman scrambled to her feet and jabbed a finger at Luna. "None of your damn business! Why should my son pay?"

The crowd burst into laughter.

"So it’s fine for Dr. Collins to pay, but not your son?"
"Using your granddaughter as an excuse to extort money?"
"Disgusting! Call security to throw her out!"

Luna turned to Lily. "Dr. Collins, your ex-husband is still living in your house, isn’t he? He keeps asking for money in your daughter’s name, and now he wants child support too..."

She drew out her words. "You’re not just raising a daughter—you’re supporting your ex-husband’s entire family. What a—saintly woman you are."

Lily hung her head in shame. Why had she never been able to say these simple truths herself?
###Chapter 197: Justice Served

"Oh dear, Dr. Collins, you're too soft-hearted!" A middle-aged woman with curly hair slapped her thigh and exclaimed. "You're divorced, yet you're still supporting your ex-husband's entire family—even his new wife? Back in my village, people would've cursed you to your face for that!"

Beside her, a bespectacled woman adjusted her glasses. "Dr. Collins, you're being taken advantage of. When my daughter divorced, the court only ordered three hundred a month in alimony. Your ex-husband is really..."

"Exactly!" A patient in a hospital gown chimed in. "A man like that should be exposed! You should go to his workplace and demand justice from his superiors!"

The crowd buzzed with opinions, each remark cutting deep.

Luna White smirked and quietly slipped away from the group. This feeling... was exhilarating.

Seeing the tide turning against her, the old woman pinched Little Phoenix's arm hard, then plopped onto the ground, wailing, "Bullying! You're bullying a helpless widow and orphan!"

"Enough!" Director Zhang roared. "Security! Get these troublemakers out of here!"

"Yes, sir!" Several young doctors rolled up their sleeves and stepped forward.

The old woman sprang up like a fish out of water, yanking Little Phoenix along as she fled. Before leaving, the girl shot Dr. Collins a venomous glare, drawing laughter from the crowd.

"Dr. Collins," a patient's relative patted her shoulder. "You can't be too meek. See? The moment you spoke up, everyone stood by you."

"Absolutely! Take back your house! Let the court decide the alimony!"

Dr. Collins' eyes burned with unshed tears. For years, she had hidden her suffering, afraid of becoming a laughingstock. But now...

"Thank you, everyone..." Her voice trembled.

Director Zhang waved his hand. "Disperse, everyone." Then, turning to Dr. Collins, he said, "Come to my office."

Her heart pounded. This was it—she was surely going to be reprimanded.

Inside the office, Director Zhang handed her a business card. "This is my old comrade—specializes in divorce cases. Go see him."

Dr. Collins froze.

"Remember," the director said sternly, "doctors at our military hospital won't be bullied like this!"

The dam broke, and her tears finally spilled over.

In that moment, she understood: Silence wasn't golden. Some battles were worth fighting.
###Chapter 198: Ruthless

Eleanor Wallace stormed into the house, her face smeared with dust. Frank Ferguson was waiting in the living room for news. He was anxious about the monthly allowance—after all, he had promised his son toys and chicken drumsticks.

Their combined wages barely covered basic necessities. The only reason they could afford small luxuries was the monthly stipend from Lily Collins. Their son was their pride and joy, and they couldn’t bear to deprive him. Besides, as he grew older, expenses would only pile up.

When Eleanor barged in, fuming, with a bewildered Phoenix trailing behind her, Frank’s heart sank. Something had gone wrong. Had his mother failed?

"Mom, how did it go?" he asked cautiously, handing her a cup of tea.

Eleanor shot Phoenix a venomous glare. "It’s all this useless girl’s fault! Why didn’t you cling to your mother’s leg and cry? Because of you, I got humiliated like never before!" She directed all her rage at the child.

Phoenix was hurt. Since she was little, her grandmother and father had drilled into her that Lily was a bad mother, so she had learned to resent her. But this wasn’t her fault.

"Grandma, Lily refused to give the money—why blame me?" she retorted defiantly. As the favored child, she had never held back her words.

Frank frowned. "Mom, what exactly happened?"

After hearing Eleanor’s account, Frank’s expression darkened. They had always been able to manipulate Lily because she cared about appearances and feared public shame. But now that she had support, she was standing her ground.

"Phoenix, go home and help your mother with chores," he snapped, too agitated to deal with her.

Phoenix dragged her feet. Ever since her half-brother was born, the atmosphere at home had changed. Her stepmother, Maggie Lawson, smiled sweetly to her face but never missed a chance to order her around.

"Dad, I want to go with you—"

"Just go!" Frank suddenly raised his voice. "Since when do you disobey me?"

Tears welled up in Phoenix’s eyes as she left, her heart pounding. Her father had never been this harsh with her before.

When she got home, Maggie was bathing her little brother.

"Phoenix, you’re back? Where’s your dad?" Maggie asked sweetly. She had her eye on a new fabric and was counting on the allowance to buy it.

"He said he’d stay with Grandma a little longer..."

"Go do your homework. Your dad will bring chicken drumsticks when he gets back," Maggie coaxed. Privately, she thought, If it weren’t for that twenty-dollar allowance, I wouldn’t bother with someone else’s brat.

Meanwhile, Frank and Eleanor were scheming.

"Mom, what do we do now?"

Eleanor smirked darkly. "It depends on how ruthless you’re willing to be."

"What do you mean?"

"Make Phoenix suffer a little, then send her to Lily in tears. Let’s see if her mother’s heart can take it!" Eleanor lowered her voice. "With the child in our hands, she’ll have no choice but to comply."

Frank hesitated. "What if she demands custody?"

"Don’t be ridiculous! You’re her father!" Eleanor scoffed. "Who doesn’t discipline their kids? Even the police can’t interfere!"

Frank clenched his jaw. "Fine. I’ll handle it when I get home."

When he returned, his three-year-old son ran into his arms. Maggie’s face fell when she saw his empty hands. "Where are the apples?"

After hearing his explanation, she exploded. "Frank Ferguson! Are you trying to starve us?"

"Of course not!" Frank forced a smile. "I have a plan. Within a month, Lily will be begging to send us money!"

Maggie’s anger melted into a coquettish smile. "You devil, always full of ideas! But let me make one thing clear—if the allowance stops, I’m not lifting a finger for that girl!"

Frank pulled her close. "Don’t worry. Starting today, she’ll do every chore she’s supposed to."

"You won’t feel bad?" Maggie eyed him skeptically.

"The only one I care about is you..." Frank dragged her toward the bedroom, calling over his shoulder, "Phoenix! Come watch your brother! Your mother and I have things to do!"
###Chapter 199: Blood and Tears

The pencil scratched against the notebook as Phoenix focused on solving math problems, only to flinch when Frank's furious roar echoed through the house. She bit her lip in frustration—wasn't taking care of Bobby supposed to be Maggie's job? Why was it always dumped on her?

But today, her father's face was darker than storm clouds. Too afraid to disobey, Phoenix silently set down her pencil and dragged Bobby into her room. She sat him on the edge of her bed to play while she returned to her homework.

"I want that! Give it to me!" Bobby suddenly lunged at her desk, chubby fingers stabbing toward her pencil. Phoenix frowned and snapped, "Stop it! This isn't a toy!"

The spoiled little tyrant wasn't used to being denied. He grabbed for it, and as Phoenix jerked away—thud—Bobby toppled off the bed, his forehead smashing against the corner of a chair. Blood gushed instantly.

The ear-splitting wail brought Frank and Maggie stumbling in—Frank with his pants half-fastened, Maggie with her bra on backward. They found Bobby sprawled on the floor, face covered in blood, while Phoenix stood frozen beside him.

"You little monster!" Frank's eyes burned red, the frustration from earlier that day boiling over. He scooped Bobby up and backhanded Phoenix across the face, then kicked her hard in the stomach. "You dare hurt your brother? If anything happens to him, I'll skin you alive!"

Maggie watched coldly, grabbing her purse as she hurried after Frank. Before leaving, she glanced back at Phoenix, curled up and trembling in the corner, and smirked.

Phoenix clutched her stinging cheek. The pain in her stomach was nothing compared to the ache in her chest. The father who'd once been kind now looked at her like she was his worst enemy. The stepmother who'd always smiled at her couldn't even spare a glance.

A sudden chill ran through her—if something really happened to Bobby… her father would kill her.

When she staggered into her grandmother's house, the old woman was stir-frying vegetables at the stove. Seeing her granddaughter covered in blood, she didn't even pause. "What now?"

"Grandma! Dad's going to kill me!" Phoenix clung to her.

"Stop being so dramatic," the old woman scoffed, shoving her away. "Blame that heartless mother of yours! If she'd just send the child support—"

"It was an accident! Bobby fell!" Phoenix cried. "It's not Lily's fault!"

The spatula, slick with hot oil, came crashing down. "You wretched girl!" Her grandmother's face twisted with rage. "How dare you hurt my grandson? You should be the one dead!" Every strike was vicious—Phoenix's braid came undone, her scalp burning where hair was ripped out.

When she finally escaped, curses followed her into the street. Phoenix touched the sticky blood on her face… and laughed. All those warm words, those loving smiles—they'd only ever been about the monthly checks from Lily.

The setting sun stretched her shadow long and thin. Standing at the mouth of the alley, the girl realized for the first time how vast the world was—and how little room it had for her.
###Chapter 200: A Ray of Hope in Despair

The icy wind howled as Phoenix stumbled out of the house. Her thin school uniform offered no protection against the biting cold, but she barely felt the chill—her heart was far colder.

"Get out! Worthless brat!" Her grandmother's curses still echoed in her ears. The image of her father's twisted expression as he kicked her in the stomach was seared into her mind like a knife wound.

All these years of so-called love had been nothing but a pretense—conditional on the money her mother sent. Now that the payments had stopped, she was nothing but a burden.

Clutching her stomach, Phoenix trembled, her back drenched in cold sweat. Every step sent sharp pain shooting through her body, making her vision blur. The streets were crowded with hurried passersby, but no one noticed the frail girl swaying unsteadily.

"Mom..." Suddenly, she remembered the look in Lily's eyes at the hospital earlier that day. There had been no resentment—only pain. Even after being publicly humiliated by her, Lily had still slipped fever medicine into her pocket.

The hospital entrance was just ahead, but Phoenix couldn't hold on any longer.

"Miss!" A security guard rushed forward, catching her as she collapsed.

The emergency room lights glared harshly. When Lily arrived, her lab coat was even on backward.

"Internal bleeding! Prep for surgery!" A colleague's shout made her legs buckle.

Outside the operating room, Lily clutched the medical chart with white-knuckled intensity. The X-ray clearly showed an intestinal perforation—caused by blunt force trauma. She suddenly recalled the vicious glint in Frank's eyes when Phoenix had confronted her at the hospital earlier.

"Dr. Collins..." A nurse hesitantly handed her a phone. "The police station called. The Fergusons reported that their child stole money and ran away."

Lily let out a cold laugh. Gently brushing her fingers over her daughter's bruised forehead, she dialed her lawyer.

"I'm suing Frank Ferguson for child abuse," she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. "And pull the surveillance footage from the hospital entrance today."

In the ICU, the heart monitor beeped steadily. As Lily leaned over to tuck the blanket around her daughter, a tear fell onto the cast.

"This time, I'll protect you," she whispered, wiping the tear from Phoenix's cheek. "I won't let go again."

Down the hallway, officers were taking statements. The security footage clearly showed Phoenix clutching her stomach, staggering toward the hospital in agony.

"The evidence is solid," the senior officer closed his notebook, glancing at the small figure in the hospital bed. "This kid's got a strong will to live."

Outside, the first light of dawn broke through the clouds. Lily tightened her grip on her daughter's cold hand, standing tall in the morning light.
###Chapter 201: The Police Arrive

The security team arrived first. The incident had already spread like wildfire, and as soon as Lily Collins spoke up, they sprang into action. A detailed statement was taken on-site, with bystanders willingly providing testimonies. The security team even took photographs as evidence.

Soon after, officers from the local police station arrived.

Lily, while tending to her daughter, recounted the events clearly. The officers conducted a thorough investigation before leaving.

In the hospital room, Lily sat by the bed, gently stroking her daughter’s forehead as tears streamed down her face. How much suffering had this child endured?

Phoenix woke up in the middle of the night. The first thing she saw was her mother holding her hand, asleep by the bedside. The pale-faced girl finally managed a faint smile. Her mother still loved her—she hadn’t abandoned her despite her rebellious behavior. She squeezed her mother’s fingers lightly.

She wasn’t an unwanted child.

Frank Ferguson and Maggie Lawson carried little Bobby home. The boy had only suffered minor scrapes—it looked worse than it was. On the way, Frank got the full story from Bobby, who stammered that he’d accidentally fallen off the bed. Only then did Frank feel a twinge of guilt.

He’d wrongly accused the girl and even hit her.

But that guilt was quickly replaced by anger. The thought of Lily daring to withhold child support made his blood boil. This was the perfect opportunity to teach Phoenix a lesson—to show her what happened when her mother refused to pay.

Maggie, however, remained indifferent, focusing solely on her son. When they got home, they found the front door wide open and the house empty. Frank cursed loudly, "Where the hell did that brat run off to? I’ll beat her senseless when I find her!"

His fury hadn’t subsided.

"Save your breath. She probably went to your mother’s place," Maggie said, placing Bobby on the bed. Seeing the bandage on his head, she frowned. "It’s late. Let’s just sleep. I’m exhausted."

Bobby had already dozed off—the poor kid had been through enough for one night.

Just as the couple lay down, a thunderous knock shook the front door. Frank flew into a rage. "Who the hell is banging on the door at this hour? Looking for trouble?"

He yanked the door open, only to freeze at the sight of uniformed officers.

"Officers, uh… what’s this about?"

"Are you Frank Ferguson?"

"Yes, that’s me!" Frank’s heart pounded. He was all talk—he’d never actually dared to commit any real crimes. Why were the police here?

"Is Phoenix Foster your daughter?" The officer’s expression was grave. This case had drawn serious attention—it involved a doctor’s family, making it no small matter.

"Y-yes, she’s my daughter." Frank’s stomach dropped. Had Lily gone to the police? But what could they possibly charge him with?

Then it hit him—he’d hit Phoenix earlier. Had that wretched girl and her mother teamed up to report him?

"Come with us to the station for questioning," the officer said firmly after confirming his identity.

Frank panicked. "Officer, I haven’t done anything wrong!"

"We’re just asking you to cooperate with the investigation," the officer said sternly. "Your daughter Phoenix is currently hospitalized with severe injuries—head trauma and peritonitis caused by intestinal perforation. Her mother has filed a report alleging child abuse."

"That’s impossible!" Frank jumped up. "I only slapped her and kicked her once! How could it be that serious? Lily’s framing me!"

"Enough!" The officer grabbed him. "We’ll determine whether it’s a frame-up after the investigation. If you’re innocent, you’ll be released."

Maggie rushed out at the commotion and gasped when she saw her husband being taken away. "Officers, what’s he being accused of?"

"He’s been reported for child abuse resulting in serious injury," the officer said, pushing Frank toward the car. "Interfere again, and we’ll take you in too!"

Frank turned his head and shouted, "Go talk to Mom!" Before he could finish, he was shoved into the police car.

Maggie, left with a sleeping Bobby, paced anxiously. There was no way she could leave the house with the child now—she’d have to wait until morning.

At the crack of dawn, Maggie rushed to her mother-in-law’s house with Bobby in her arms.

The old woman was tidying up when her daughter-in-law burst in with her grandson. The sight of the bandage on Bobby’s head immediately reminded her of that troublesome Phoenix.

"Why are you carrying him around with that injury? What if he catches a chill?" she scolded, quickly wrapping the boy in a blanket and settling him on the heated bed.

Bobby, full of energy, happily played with a biscuit.

Maggie gasped for breath. "Mom, something terrible has happened!"

The old woman handed her grandson another biscuit. "What could possibly happen this early in the morning?" She beamed as the boy munched away.

"Mom! Frank’s been arrested!"

The biscuit slipped from the old woman’s fingers and hit the floor.

"What? What nonsense are you spouting? What could Frank have possibly done?" She knew her son better than anyone—Frank was all bark at home, but he wouldn’t dare cause trouble outside. Why would the police come for him?
###Chapter 202: The Scam

"Mom! Something terrible happened!" Maggie Lawson burst into the room in a panic, her apron twisted tightly in her hands. "The police came last night—they said Phoenix has a perforated intestine from the beating and is in the ICU now! Lily Collins reported it!"

The old woman's spatula clattered to the floor. "That's nonsense!" she snapped, though her heart pounded. She had hit the girl with the spatula yesterday, but surely it wasn't that bad?

"Mom, you have to do something!" Maggie stomped her foot anxiously. "Frank still isn't back, and I'm worried sick..."

The old woman's eyes narrowed, then she suddenly slapped her thigh. "I get it now! That bitch Lily set us up!" The more she thought about it, the more convinced she became. "She's trying to extort us so she can take Phoenix back!"

"Mom, forget that for now—just go see her!" Maggie wrung her hands. "I'll make Bobby's dinner. Hurry to the hospital!"

The old woman threw on a coat and stormed out, muttering curses under her breath. "Let's see what tricks she's playing! If she's trying to scam us, I'll lie down right in front of the police station!"

At the hospital, Dr. Luna White had just finished her rounds when she heard about Phoenix.

"Her own father did this?" Her brow furrowed, a chill running down her spine. Remembering the love her adoptive father had shown her, then seeing what Phoenix had endured, she clenched her fists.

Pushing open the hospital room door, Luna saw Lily gently helping a pale Phoenix walk slowly.

"Dr. White!" Lily greeted her with relief. "Phoenix is doing much better today. The doctor said she just needs to walk a few more laps before resting."

Phoenix glanced timidly at Luna and whispered, "Hello, Dr. White."

Before Luna could respond, the door slammed open.

"Lily! You heartless witch!" The old woman charged in like a fury, reaching for Phoenix. "Stop faking it! Come with me to the police station and tell the truth!"

Luna reacted instantly, seizing the old woman's wrist and deftly shoving her against the wall. "Ma'am, this child just had surgery. If you tear her stitches, you'll be held legally responsible!"

The old woman was about to throw a tantrum when the doctor lifted Phoenix's hospital gown, revealing the gruesome wound on her stomach. She froze.

"This... this..." The old woman stammered, her legs buckling as she nearly collapsed.

The doctor warned sternly, "The patient is extremely fragile. Any sudden movement could reopen the wound!"

Lily held Phoenix tightly, tears streaming down her face. "Mom, look what your son did!"

The old woman's face turned ashen. Suddenly, she dropped to the floor, wailing and slapping her thighs. "Heavens, how can we go on like this..."

Luna watched coldly, her mind already made up. This time, she would make sure this family paid for what they'd done.
###Chapter 203: Standing Her Ground

"Was there really an operation?" The old woman grabbed the doctor's white coat, her nails digging into the fabric.

The doctor shook her off, his brows furrowed in irritation. This woman was infamous in the hospital—everyone knew her antics. Now she was causing a scene in the ward, as if her granddaughter's life wasn't hanging by a thread.

"Madam, your granddaughter suffered a perforated intestine and peritonitis yesterday—she nearly died! The surgery was less than 24 hours ago. For heaven's sake, let the child rest!" He pointed at Phoenix on the bed, her face ghostly pale. "A child this young going through such an operation needs proper aftercare, or she’ll suffer complications. If you truly care for her, go home."

The old woman's mouth opened and closed like a strangled hen. She had assumed Lily and Phoenix were faking it to get her son Frank arrested. She never imagined her granddaughter had actually endured such agony.

Phoenix clutched Lily's hand, her eyes fixed on the ceiling, refusing to look at her grandmother. The old woman's flicker of pity vanished—how dare this girl cling to that wretched woman after all the Fergusons had done for her?

"Lily!" the old woman shrieked. "Go to the police station right now and clear this up! Release Frank! What’s wrong with a father disciplining his child? If everyone made a fuss like you, every parent in the city would be behind bars!"

Phoenix's fingers tightened around Lily's hand. Of course. Her grandmother wasn’t here for her. Every visit was either for money or to throw a tantrum. This time, she didn’t even bother pretending.

Lily felt her daughter tremble. She took a deep breath and stepped between the bed and the old woman. "I’ve made my statement to the police. You have no idea how close we came to losing her yesterday. If we hadn’t gotten her to the hospital in time..." Her voice cracked. "I’m filing for full custody. If you have anything else to say, take it up with the judge."

"What?!" The old woman's eyes bulged. "Phoenix is a Ferguson! You won’t take her anywhere!" She lunged for the IV line.

Lily shoved her back, sending the old woman stumbling. For a moment, the woman was stunned—her always-composed daughter-in-law had actually laid hands on her?

"Murder! She’s stealing my granddaughter and framing my son!" The old woman collapsed onto the floor, wailing.

"Keep screaming," Lily said coldly, pulling out her military ID. "I’m an active-duty officer, and Phoenix is a military dependent. Your son knows exactly what the penalty is for abusing a service member’s family." She turned to Luna. "Call Security."

Security arrived swiftly. The old woman was dragged out, still screeching threats, until someone mentioned calling the police. Then she fell silent.

At the end of the hallway, Lily watched the retreating figure, the weight in her chest finally lifting. She returned to the room and gently took her daughter’s hand. "Don’t be afraid. I’m here."

Phoenix’s tears fell at last, landing on their clasped hands.
###Chapter 204: Luna's Triumph

Luna White sat in the clinic, lost in thought. It suddenly struck her how many women's vulnerabilities stemmed from their children. Just like her eldest sister, who endured domestic violence from that man—wasn't it all for the sake of giving her three children a complete family? Once a woman becomes a mother, the first thing she sacrifices is always herself.

How was her eldest sister doing now?

Last month, when she received her paycheck, she sent money to both her sisters and wrote letters to reassure them. But so far, only her elder brother, Ethan, had replied. Her second sister and eldest sister remained silent.

There was good news, though: Ethan had received a transfer order and would be moving to the province where she lived. This was wonderful. He had originally been stationed at the Yunnan border before being reassigned to a border inspection post—partly as a disciplinary measure, partly due to work requirements.

Now that he was being transferred inland, the danger level dropped significantly. It seemed he could live out the rest of his days in peace.

Meanwhile, Luna Whitaker was thriving in the village.

Winter was approaching. By the twelfth lunar month, the five pigs she raised would be ready for market. Aside from one breeding sow, the other four had already reached two hundred pounds each. With another month of feeding, they’d likely hit two hundred forty to fifty pounds.

Four pigs would fetch several hundred yuan. She planned to buy a few more piglets afterward—life was looking brighter every day.

Her three sons were also making her proud. The youngest, Samuel, was excelling in school in the neighboring village, ranking at the top of his class. His teacher said he was sure to pass the entrance exam for the county’s middle school next year. Luna couldn’t help but smile—maybe her son really could follow in his aunt’s footsteps, go to college, and secure a stable job.

The two older boys, Ethan and Aaron, were just as hardworking. They took care of the pigs and chickens, eager to help with any chore. Feeding five pigs was no small task, but the brothers gathered wild greens in summer and gleaned wheat ears in autumn. During the ten-day harvest season alone, they’d lost over ten pounds from the hard work.

The wheat ears they collected filled four large sacks, each weighing at least three hundred pounds. Ground into flour, it would last them the entire winter. The leftover bran could still be used to feed the pigs.

The villagers praised the brothers for their diligence. They left for the fields before dawn and didn’t return until after dark. Everyone said that if their family had a few acres of land, they’d farm better than anyone else.

Raising chickens was another skill. While other households lost birds frequently, not a single one of her thirty-odd chickens had died. The brothers dug up wild vegetables and caught insects daily, keeping the flock plump and healthy. With twenty-five hens, she now collected over twenty eggs a day.

Aside from giving each of her three sons an egg daily for nutrition, she sold the rest at the market every three days. At fifteen cents per egg, she made eighty to ninety yuan a month just from eggs—an income that rivaled even city workers.

Luna now walked with her head held high. When she’d first left that house with her children, she’d been terrified—no land, no food, afraid of burdening her siblings. But now? Through her own hard work, raising pigs and chickens, she lived better than most.

Selling two batches of pigs a year could bring in over a thousand yuan. She planned to save up first to renovate the house. When her younger brother married, he couldn’t live in this shabby place. If any homestead land became available in the village, she’d buy a plot to build new houses for her sons in the future.

She could afford Samuel’s education and save up for her sons’ wedding dowries. In the past, she wouldn’t have dared dream of such things even if it killed her.

Now? Luna Whitaker had strength to spare!
###Chapter 205: The Matchmaking Visit

At the first light of dawn, Luna Whitaker carried a wicker basket toward the chicken coop. The morning dew dampened her cloth shoes, but she paid no mind, deftly reaching into the nest to gather eggs.

"Cluck, cluck..." She scattered a handful of corn, and the chickens flocked around her. As she fed them and counted the freshly collected eggs, a faint smile touched her lips.

"Luna!"

She looked up to see Ryan Wallace standing at the gate. Today, he looked unusually sharp—his slate-blue tunic neatly pressed, even his usually scruffy beard cleanly shaved. But those shoes...

Luna's heart skipped a beat. They were the pair she had stitched for him two months ago.

"You look very smart today, Ryan," she said, forcing a smile while suppressing the flutter in her chest.

Ryan scratched his head, his sun-darkened cheeks flushing. "Aunt Zhang from the next village is bringing someone... to meet my father."

The corn slipped from Luna's fingers, scattering across the ground. She understood immediately—this was a matchmaking visit for Ryan.

"Oh... congratulations," she murmured, lowering her gaze, her voice trembling slightly.

Ryan was forty now. Luna knew he had delayed marriage for years to help his family raise pigs. Now that the Wallaces were doing better, it was time for him to find a good woman.

So why did her chest ache so much?

"Wait here." Luna suddenly turned and hurried inside, digging out a brand-new pair of cloth shoes from the bottom of her wooden chest. She had stayed up three nights finishing them, the soles tightly stitched.

"Put these on," she said, handing them over. "New clothes deserve new shoes."

When Ryan's rough hands took them, his fingers brushed against hers. A jolt shot through her fingertips straight to her heart.

"Thanks." He sat on the stone bench in the yard, clumsily changing his shoes—adorably awkward. Standing up, he took a few steps before blurting out, "Not like it'll work out anyway."

"What?" Luna froze.

But Ryan walked away without looking back, his silhouette radiating an inexplicable loneliness.

Luna stood motionless. Bending down, she picked up his old shoes and saw the soles were worn through. He had worn them... every single day for two months.

As she washed them by the water basin, tears suddenly splashed into the water. She wiped them away hastily with the back of her hand, scolding herself inwardly: Luna Whitaker, what are you thinking? A divorced woman with three sons—stop this foolishness.

Her boys were still asleep inside. Taking a deep breath, she hung the washed shoes under the eaves. Sunlight refracted through the water droplets, casting tiny rainbows.

Just like the secret in her heart—one she could never speak aloud.
###Chapter 206: Arm Yourselves

Ethan and Aaron Whitaker returned with bundles of firewood strapped to their backs.

The two energetic young men couldn't stay idle and often ventured into the mountains. Over the past few months, they'd kept their home in perfect order, stacking enough firewood in the yard to last the entire winter.

Luna White stepped out upon hearing the commotion and hurried to help her sons unload.

"My dear boys, must you carry so much?" Luna fretted, brushing wood chips from their clothes. "You're still growing—you shouldn't strain yourselves like this."

Ethan grinned, wiping sweat from his brow. "Mom, this is nothing. Your son's got plenty of strength now." He flexed his arm playfully, showing off his muscles.

Aaron chuckled. "Don't worry, Mom. Compared to hauling stones at the quarry, this feels like child's play."

Luna still frowned, ushering them inside. "Go wash up. Dinner's ready. You must be starving after leaving so early."

Just then, a shout came from the gate. "Is this Luna White's place?"

Luna turned, puzzled. Everyone in the village knew where she lived.

Five or six people barged in, carrying two others on their backs.

Luna's jaw nearly dropped—it was Darren Lewis and his mother, Margaret.

In just a few months, Darren had become completely paralyzed, only his eyes still moving. Margaret looked even worse, her face twisted, one side of her body twitching uncontrollably, drool dripping from her mouth.

They were being carried by Derek Lewis and his family.

"What are you doing here?" Luna's face darkened. She'd divorced Darren long ago—how dare they show up now?

Derek forced a smile. His wife, Chloe Dawson, rushed forward, grabbing Luna's hand. "Sister-in-law! We finally found you!"

Luna yanked her hand away. "Chloe, I divorced Darren. Don't call me that. State your business or leave. We're busy."

Chloe's expression soured. She hadn't expected Luna to be so firm. Switching tactics, she wailed, "Sister-in-law, how can you say that? Even after divorce, there's still history between you. You shared years together and have three sons. No matter how awful Darren was, you can't just abandon him now!"

Luna scoffed. "Oh, now you remember 'history'? Where was that when he was beating me? Darren means nothing to me. Get out before I grab a broom!"

She saw right through them—the Lewis family wanted to dump their burdens on her now that Darren was useless.

When soft words failed, Chloe snarled, "Luna, don't push your luck! These boys are still Darren's blood, aren't they? Sons should care for their father! And as the eldest, he's responsible for his mother—that's the rule! Ethan, Aaron, Samuel—your father and grandmother are here. If you abandon them, heaven will strike you down!"

Now Luna understood. They were trying to saddle her sons with these two burdens.

"Bullshit!" Luna trembled with rage. "Ethan, Aaron—arm yourselves! Let's see who dares leave these parasites here!"

The boys were already seething. Ethan grabbed a carrying pole, Aaron snatched a fire poker, and they stood protectively behind their mother, eyes blazing.

These past months had been the best of their lives—no fear of their father beating their mother, no backbreaking labor at the quarry. They ate well, and their mother finally smiled.

These leeches wouldn't ruin their happiness.

Ethan planted the pole on the ground, his voice deadly. "Try leaving them here, and I'll break your legs."
###Chapter 207: Fight to the Death

Chloe Dawson and Derek Lewis stumbled back in shock. Having lived in the same village for over a decade, they knew Luna Whitaker and her sons were famously mild-mannered. For years, the old woman had taken Luna's hard-earned wages from stone carrying, yet Luna never dared to protest. Who would have thought she'd grab a carrying pole and fight like a wildcat today?

"Luna! Don't you dare!" Derek barked, though sweat beaded on his forehead. "You think we're scared of a woman? Besides, sons supporting their father is only right—you want your boys branded as unfilial?"

The Lewis household had been in chaos for months. After the divorce, Paul Jackson initially enjoyed his freedom, mooching meals off his mother. Then one morning, he woke up paralyzed, unable to speak. The shock sent old Margaret Jackson tumbling—now she was bedridden too.

Tending to two invalids was hell. Paul needed help even to relieve himself, while Margaret soiled herself constantly. The stench in the house was unbearable. After months of misery, they'd hatched this scheme.

"Beat them dead!" Luna's eyes burned red. "I'm done holding back! My sister was right—we can't show mercy to bloodsuckers!"

Ethan and his brothers tightened their grips on the poles. "Don't worry, Mom. We'll take the blame!"

Derek turned to flee. "Run!"

Too late.

Outside the gate, Mayor George Clark blocked the path with twenty armed villagers. Derek's legs trembled—they'd counted on Six Paths Village staying out of this. How had the mayor mobilized so many?

"What's going on here?" George's icy gaze swept over the two figures on stretchers.

Seeing reinforcements, Luna's strength drained away. Her voice shook. "Uncle... They're forcing my boys to care for these two..."

Derek fumbled for cigarettes. "Mayor, have a smoke—"

Smack!

Ryan Wallace sent him sprawling with one slap.

"Good hit!" George snapped. "You dare cause trouble in Six Paths Village? Got a death wish?"
###Chapter 208: Standing Up for Justice

Ryan Wallace was being pressured by his family to meet a potential bride. The matchmaker had already arrived with the young woman at their doorstep.

He couldn't even be bothered to lift his eyelids. In his foul mood, not even the most beautiful woman in the world could catch his attention.

The girl, however, seemed quite taken with his family's property. The moment she stepped inside, her eyes locked onto the row of sturdy brick houses. When she turned her gaze to Ryan, her expression brightened. She eagerly asked how many pigs the family owned, and upon hearing there were thirty full-grown hogs and hundreds of piglets, her eyes gleamed like a starving wolf spotting prey.

Ryan was thoroughly annoyed. Just as he was searching for an excuse to escape, Mayor George Clark's voice boomed from outside the courtyard: "Luna Whitaker's in trouble! Grab your tools and lend a hand!"

Without hesitation, Ryan snatched up a carrying pole and bolted out the door, leaving the matchmaker and the bewildered girl behind.

The matchmaker and the young woman exchanged awkward glances. Fortunately, Walter Wallace quickly stepped in to smooth things over before the situation became unbearably tense.

When Ryan arrived at Luna's home with the mayor, he found her standing in the center of the yard, broom in hand. Behind her, her two sons stood ready—one gripping a carrying pole, the other a fire poker. The usually gentle Luna now carried an air of defiance, her delicate features hardened with determination, giving her an unexpectedly striking presence.

The moment Ryan heard the Lewis family was causing trouble, his blood boiled. When Derek Lewis tried to sweet-talk the mayor, Ryan didn't hesitate—he slapped the man across the face.

What kind of man bullies a woman?

Though Ryan didn't know the details of Luna's divorce, the Lewises' behavior told him everything he needed to know. Besides, he knew Luna well—stubborn and resilient, raising three children alone without complaint despite the hardships. Even with the village's idle men constantly lurking around her door, she managed to keep her life in perfect order.

"Six Paths Village is bullying outsiders!" Chloe Dawson shrieked, rushing to shield her husband. "How dare you hit him?"

George Clark sneered. "You're damn right we hit him! Coming here to cause trouble and expecting us to just stand by? Get the hell out of here! Luna's already divorced from Darren Lewis, and the kids are hers to raise. She's being generous not demanding child support from that deadbeat, and now you want underage boys to support their father? Ever heard of the law?"

"Should I call the local police station to give you a legal lesson? Take your trash and get out!" George's glare was sharp enough to cut steel. "You think you can cause trouble in Six Paths Village? Know whose territory you're stepping on!"

Chloe and Derek were stunned. They'd thought Luna, with no family to back her up, would be an easy target. They never expected the entire village to stand behind her. If things escalated, they'd be lucky to leave Six Paths Village in one piece.

The couple backed down immediately. They knew nothing about the law, but they understood one thing—when the mayor spoke, his word was final. Nobody dared cross him.

The group hastily carried Darren and Margaret Lewis away, tails between their legs.

The villagers cheered.

Luna dropped the broom, her eyes red as she bowed deeply. "Thank you, everyone!"

George waved her off. "No need for thanks! Did you really think we'd let outsiders bully one of our own? Next time there's trouble, just sound the alarm. Let's see who dares to mess with you!" He wasn't bluffing. In these times, village disputes often turned violent, and when the whole community stood together, the law tended to look the other way.

As the crowd dispersed, George turned to Luna. "Remember what I said, girl. As long as I'm here, nobody's touching you or those kids."

Luna nodded. "I'll remember, Uncle."

George was about to leave when he noticed Ryan still lingering. "What are you still doing here?"

Ryan glanced at Luna. "If you need anything, just call."

Luna nodded again. "Understood."

Once everyone was gone, Luna's legs gave out, and she nearly collapsed. Her sons quickly helped her inside to lie down.

The yard was a mess. The boys silently cleaned up before tending to the pigs.

Luna lay on the bed, her chest tight with emotion. She'd fought so hard for this new life—why couldn't the Lewises just leave her and the children alone?

This was only the beginning. If Derek had set his mind to this, he'd be back.

Luna clenched the quilt, her nails digging into her palms.
###Chapter 209: Father and Son Clash

Ryan Wallace trudged behind Mayor George Clark, his feet heavy as if filled with lead. His chest felt tight, a suffocating lump stuck in his throat that he couldn't swallow or spit out.

"Ryan, do you have feelings for Luna?" George suddenly stopped walking, his words striking Ryan like a thunderbolt.

Ryan's face flushed crimson. "Mayor, what are you saying? I just think she and her kids have it rough—"

"Good. Keep it that way." George sighed. "Luna's a fine woman, but fate dealt her a bad hand with that scoundrel. She's finally found some peace—have you seen a single quiet day in her house?"

Ryan clenched his fists, his nails digging into his palms.

"If you truly care for her, I won't stop you. But your father's temper..." George shook his head. "He's made it clear he wants you to marry a maiden. If you can't protect her, don't stir up trouble."

Ryan stood rooted to the spot, watching George's retreating figure disappear down the alley.

When he pushed open the gate to his house, his parents were in the yard, animatedly discussing something.

"Ryan's back!" Walter Wallace puffed on his pipe. "How was the girl today? Good childbearing hips!"

"Not interested," Ryan muttered.

"What?" Walter nearly dropped his pipe. "You're turning down a catch like that?"

"Am I marrying her, or are you?" Ryan raised his voice abruptly.

Thwack! The pipe struck his back hard. "You insolent brat! Forty years old and still unmarried—do you want our line to end with you?"

Ryan stiffened, refusing to speak.

His mother Eleanor stamped her foot in frustration. "Child, our family's well-off enough to be picky! Wait much longer, and you'll only find widows!"

"What's wrong with widows?" The words burst from Ryan's lips before he could stop them.

"Over my dead body!" Walter roared. "Unless I'm in my grave, you'll get out and make your own way!"

"Fine by me!" Ryan's eyes lit up.

"Go on, then! But don't you dare use the Wallace butchering trade!" Walter's beard quivered with rage.

As the argument teetered on the brink of irreparable damage, Eleanor slapped Ryan's back. "You fool! Why provoke your father?"

Ryan gritted his teeth and fell silent. He knew leaving the family wouldn't be so simple.

"Mark my words," Walter narrowed his eyes. "Not one Wallace in generations has married a divorced woman. Break that tradition, and you're no son of mine!"

Eleanor wiped her tears. "Hush, old man! The boy said there's nothing to it!"

Walter snorted. "He's my son—I know him better than anyone. Stubborn as a mule!" He glared at Ryan. "Without butchering, how will you put food on your table?"

Ryan's clenched fists trembled slightly. His father was right—in this backwater, he had no other skills to speak of.
###Chapter 210: Drunken Confessions

"Old man, don't talk nonsense. Ryan isn't that kind of person. Ryan, tell your father it's not true." The old woman stamped her foot anxiously.

Ryan Wallace remained silent as he walked toward the backyard, leaving no clear answer.

Watching her son's retreating figure, the old woman's heart pounded. "Old man, with Ryan reacting like this... could he really have such thoughts?"

Old Man Wallace squinted, taking a deep drag from his pipe. Amid the swirling smoke, his expression was unreadable.

"We'll arrange the marriage tomorrow. We can't delay our eldest's wedding any longer." He exhaled a smoke ring. "If he could say such things today, there must be something on his mind. Don't I know my own son? He's probably taken a liking to some young wife in the village."

The old woman was still confused. "That can't be. Ryan never even goes near women."

If she could see her son interacting with a woman, she'd actually feel relieved. Their eldest son, named Ryan, had a temperament as hard as stone—all he knew was work. Raising pigs, delivering livestock—he handled everything at home. Of their three sons, he was the most devoted to the family.

Old Man Wallace shook his head. "That's exactly what makes it dangerous. We need to get him married quickly. Once he's sharing a bed with his new wife, all those thoughts will disappear."

The old woman nodded repeatedly. "Alright, we'll go first thing tomorrow."

For their son's sake, the old couple resolved to act swiftly.

In the backyard, Ryan worked up a sweat, but the fire inside him only burned hotter. The frustration he'd been holding since morning now seared through his entire body.

As he worked, the image of Luna handing him shoes kept flashing before his eyes. Just the memory of touching her hands sent an electric current through him, leaving him restless and feverish.

He labored until nightfall, hastily ate a few bites of food, then wandered to the village reservoir to sit and brood.

........

All three children were fast asleep.

The courtyard gate was locked.

Luna sat cross-legged on the kang, a plate of peanuts and a bottle of apricot blossom liquor in front of her. The liquor, leftover from entertaining the mayor days ago, had a sweet, smooth taste that didn't burn the throat.

She'd already drunk nearly half the bottle. Her body felt light, and the heaviness in her heart had finally eased somewhat.

Suddenly, the courtyard gate creaked. Luna pulled a pair of scissors from under her pillow and staggered to the door.

"Who is it?" Since her divorce, idle men often came knocking at night.

"It's me. Ryan."

Luna relaxed and unlatched the door.

"Ryan, what brings you here so late?"

As the door opened, the strong scent of alcohol hit him. Ryan frowned, closed the door behind him, and steadied the swaying Luna.

"What are you doing drinking at this hour?" he scolded, guiding her back inside.

The liquor bottle on the kang table was more than half empty. Luna, her eyes bleary with drink, pointed to the opposite side. "Ryan... you came at the perfect time... Let me toast you... Thank you for looking after me and the kids..."

She raised the cup and drank, not noticing Ryan didn't even have a glass.

Ryan grabbed her wrist. "Stop drinking!"

Luna pulled her hand free. "Let me drink... My heart feels so heavy..." She downed another cup, and suddenly, tears streamed down her face.

"When I married Darren, I wanted to make a good life... Who knew he'd turn out to be such a monster..." Luna slurred through her story—from being forced into marriage to the beatings and humiliation, to the moments she'd nearly given up on life.

Ryan's fists clenched until his knuckles cracked, veins bulging on his forehead. He'd never known Luna had suffered so much. If not for the alcohol, she likely would have carried these words to her grave.

How could such a good woman end up with such a beast?

As Luna spoke, she finally collapsed onto the table, drunk. Ryan carefully carried her to the kang and tucked her in.

By the dim lamplight, he studied the lines on Luna's face. He still remembered her as the most beautiful girl in the village. Now, life had worn her down so much he'd barely recognized her when they first met again.

How had that once-vibrant flower withered to this?
###Chapter 211: Brotherhood

Luna Whitaker jolted awake from her dream, her chest heaving. Fragments of the night's vision lingered—Ryan Wallace sitting by her bedside, his rough hands gently brushing her cheek as his deep voice murmured words she couldn't quite recall. Though the details were hazy, the long-lost sense of safety left her cheeks burning.

"How embarrassing..." She smacked her forehead in frustration, then spotted the scattered peanut shells and empty liquor bottle on the table. Relief washed over her—just a drunken delusion.

After hastily tidying up, Luna pushed open the door and froze. The courtyard was spotless, and the aroma of breakfast wafted from the kitchen. Her eldest son, Ethan, emerged carrying bowls and chopsticks. "Mom, you should've slept longer! Aaron, Samuel, and I made breakfast."

Warmth bloomed in Luna's chest as she took the washbasin to fetch water. "Silly boy, I'm not made of glass. We've got eggs to sell at the market today—every penny counts for our new house."

Her three sons grinned. Life had improved steadily since leaving the Lewis household. Gone were the days of rationing porridge grains; now they ate steamed buns daily, each with a morning egg. The sweetest justice? Hearing that Darren Lewis was bedridden and his mother, Margaret, had fallen ill—karma at its finest.

"Let us handle the market today," Ethan insisted, his voice tender. They'd watched their mother endure backbreaking labor and abuse for years.

Luna shook her head, eyes glinting. "I'll go. Need to buy fabric for your new pants." She paused. "You've all... endured too much."

Youngest Samuel waved his hands. "I don't need any! Uncle's old army clothes fit fine." A playful smack from Ethan cut him off. "Focus on your studies, runt. You're our family's hope."

The brothers dissolved into laughter. Luna watched them, eyes misting. When she'd fled with nothing but three children, she'd never imagined this future.

"Eat up," she said, wiping her eyes. "After the market, we'll clean the chicken coop. New Year's coming—let's make it a proper reunion."

A pang struck her—still no reply from her sister Luna's letter. The girl had become a military doctor, fulfilling their parents' dreams, but spending holidays alone... Luna pushed the thought aside. Her capable sister would be fine.

Sunlight bathed the courtyard, warming her heart. Luna took a deep breath. At last, life held promise.
###Chapter 212: Market Terror

Morning dew still clung to the grass blades as Luna Whitaker finished tidying the chicken coop. She carefully arranged seventy eggs in a bamboo basket, each separated by dry straw. The eggs would fetch ten yuan and fifty cents—enough to buy fabric for new clothes for the children.

"Luna, let's go!" called Aunt Laura from next door.

Luna responded, tucking the fabric coupons and spare change into her inner pocket. Her younger brother had left them for her during his last visit, insisting she buy herself something new.

At the village entrance, Old Walter's oxcart was already surrounded by people. As Luna approached, she spotted Ryan Wallace's tall figure standing by the cart shaft. Her face burned—last night's absurd dream still vivid in her mind.

"Luna, daydreaming again?" Aunt Elizabeth pulled her forward. "Hurry up, or there won't be any seats left."

Luna kept her head low as she squeezed onto the cart, only to feel the weight shift beside her. Turning, she found Ryan sitting right next to her. The scent of soap and morning dew clung to him, making her breath hitch.

"Hold tight!" Old Walter shouted as the cart lurched. Luna tumbled straight into Ryan's arms, her nose bumping against his firm back.

"You okay?" He turned to steady her.

She shook her head hastily but caught a glimpse of his collarbone beneath his collar. The memory from the riverbank flashed before her—his sun-kissed skin glistening with sweat, muscles flexing as he swung the hoe...

"Fresh eggs for sale!"

At the market, Luna's clear voice drew customers. She had taken extra care with her hair today, and her faded blue blouse made her fair skin glow. Half a year of eating eggs regularly had even softened the fine lines at the corners of her eyes.

"Little lady, how much for the eggs?"

Three rough-looking men crowded around her. The leader, Zachary Dawson, had a face full of scars and beady eyes that kept darting toward her collar.

"Fifteen cents each," Luna said, pulling the basket closer.

"I'll take them all!" Zachary pulled out a handful of coins. "But you'll have to deliver them." He reached for her wrist.

Luna jerked back. "Take them yourself!"

"Playing hard to get?" A yellow-toothed man spat. "A divorced woman like you—"

Before he could finish, Luna smashed an egg straight into his face. Yolk dripped down his ugly features, drawing laughter from onlookers.

"You asked for this!" Zachary roared. All three lunged at her. Luna stumbled, the basket overturning, eggs shattering across the ground.

"Help!" She clung to a hitching post. Vendors nearby looked away—not one dared to speak up.

Then came a dull thud. The hand gripping her released. Luna looked up to see Zachary flying backward like a ragdoll. Ryan stood with a whip in hand, his expression terrifying.

"Scram." One word. The thugs fled.

Luna's legs gave way, nearly sending her kneeling into the broken eggs. Ryan caught her, his warm palm pressing against her icy hand.

"I'll take you to the clinic."

"No need—" She tried to pull away, but he held firm. Something in his deep eyes made her heart tremble.

Just then, a scream pierced the air: "Look out! Zachary's back with more men!"

Luna turned. A dozen thugs with clubs charged toward them. Ryan yanked her behind him, his whip cracking through the air like a gunshot.

"Stay behind me." His voice was low, his back taut as a drawn bow.


###Chapter 213: I've Butchered More Pigs Than You've Eaten Salt

Zachary Dawson's glare silenced the crowd instantly.

With a yellow-toothed grin, he reached for Luna Whitaker's shoulder. "Come with me, sweetheart. I'll treat you right—"

His words were cut short by a sickening crack as his wrist was twisted behind his back.

"Ow! Who the hell—" Zachary barely had time to curse before a fist slammed into his face, sending him sprawling to the ground.

His two lackeys finally registered the towering figure looming over them, eyes burning with fury.

"W-who are you?" they stammered.

"Let her go!" Ryan Wallace's roar made them flinch.

Luna's eyes welled with tears. "Ryan!"

Spitting blood, Zachary discovered a missing tooth and saw red. "You asking to die?" He charged at Ryan, only to be kicked three meters backward.

The lackeys scrambled to help their boss while Luna darted behind Ryan, clutching his shirt.

"Stay back," Ryan murmured. "No one touches you while I'm here."

Luna's heart warmed as she retreated into the crowd.

Zachary snapped. He whipped out a dagger, and his men brandished knives. The onlookers scattered—except for Luna, who stood her ground, bamboo basket in hand.

"Walk away while you can, punk," Zachary sneered, waving his blade.

Ryan smirked and pulled a fire poker from his pack. "Be careful!" Luna cried, stomping her foot.

That was the last straw. "Kill him!" Zachary howled.

Clang! Ryan disarmed the first attacker with one strike. But as he turned, cold steel grazed his arm—Zachary's sneak attack drew blood.

Luna screamed.

Ryan's gaze turned glacial. The poker became a blur, breaking one thug's arm before a kick sent Zachary crashing down again.

"Mercy, sir!" Zachary begged, all bravado gone.

Luna rushed forward, tugging Ryan's sleeve. "Stop!"

Ryan relented but delivered a final kick. "Next time I see you, I'll break your legs!" He pointed to his bleeding arm. "I was butchering pigs while you were still in diapers!"

Zachary's face crumpled. Today, he'd picked the wrong fight.

"I'm leaving! Right now!" He scrambled away like a beaten dog.

Luna tore off her headscarf to bandage Ryan's wound. "Does it hurt?"

Cheers erupted as the crowd returned, praising Ryan's bravery.
###Chapter 214: He's Not My Man

Luna dragged Ryan toward the shade of a tree. Blood had already soaked through his tattered sleeve and was still seeping out. Frantic, she stomped her foot and quickly asked passersby for directions to the village doctor's house.

"It's nothing, just a scratch," Ryan said dismissively, shaking his hand. As a butcher, he was used to minor injuries. He'd dodged Zachary's sneak attack quickly—only a shallow cut remained. It looked worse than it was.

But Luna's eyes were red with worry, her grip on his hand unrelenting. Ryan couldn't help but feel pleased. This wound was worth it.

"Still acting tough after losing so much blood?" Luna glared at him like a mother scolding her child.

Ryan grinned. "Had to grab the eggs first. Can't let someone else take them."

Only then did Luna remember the basket. Flustered, she turned to retrieve it, but Ryan was already hoisting the heavy egg crate onto his back, handing her the empty basket instead.

"I'll carry the heavy stuff," he insisted.

At the doctor's, the examination confirmed the wound wasn't deep—just needed disinfecting. Luna finally exhaled in relief.

By the time they left the clinic, the sun was dipping low. The market crowd had long dispersed; selling the eggs was out of the question now.

"Hurry, let's catch the ox cart," Luna urged.

But when they reached the meeting point, the cart was gone. Luna bit her lip, realizing they'd have to walk back.

Ryan suddenly grabbed her wrist. Luna jerked her hand away, her ears burning. "Speak properly!"

"Eat some noodles first," Ryan said, pointing to the roadside noodle stall. "Can't walk on an empty stomach."

Before she could refuse, he pulled her to the stall and sat her down on a bench.

"Two bowls!" Ryan called out loudly.

The stall owner swiftly prepared the noodles. Luna, worried about the cost, muttered, "We could've eaten at home..."

"I'm starving," Ryan declared shamelessly. "Just got out of a fight!"

Steaming bowls of noodles arrived, generously topped. Ryan ladled chili oil into both bowls and dug in.

Watching him wolf down his food, Luna hesitated. "Want half of mine?"

"You eat first," he said without looking up. "Had three buns this morning. Not that hungry."

Luna gritted her teeth in frustration. But after the first bite, she found herself finishing the bowl without realizing it. Her face flushed with embarrassment—only to see Ryan chatting animatedly with the stall owner.

"Check, please!" Luna abruptly interrupted.

Ryan was already shouldering the egg crate. "Let's go."

"We haven't paid yet!"

The owner chuckled. "Miss, your man already settled it. Gotta let him keep face in public."

Luna opened her mouth to protest, but Ryan was already striding ahead. She had to jog to catch up. "Give me the crate!"

"What kind of man lets a woman carry the load?" Ryan didn't even glance back.

On the way home, Luna deliberately lagged a few steps behind, afraid of gossip if they were seen together. After they arrived, Ryan checked on the pigs in the backyard and chatted with the kids before leaving.

Quietly, Luna slipped the cleaned shoes and two new pairs of cloth shoes she'd made into his basket. These tasks should belong to his wife now.
###Chapter 215: The Confrontation

The moment Ryan Wallace left, Luna Whitaker let out a long sigh of relief.

Something had felt off these past few days. The way Ryan looked at her had changed. Before, though friendly, there had always been a polite distance. Now his gaze burned with an intensity that made her skin prickle. She couldn’t bring herself to meet his eyes.

She’d hidden in the house all morning, afraid of running into him. Only after he was gone did she dare step outside. The basket of eggs still sat in the storage room—she’d have to wait until the next market day to sell them.

"Mom!" Ethan and Aaron came bounding over, faces flushed with excitement. "Uncle Ryan knows everything about raising pigs! If we keep learning from him, we’ll be experts in no time. Then we can raise a couple more, and you won’t have to work so hard." The teenage boys practically glowed with enthusiasm.

Luna’s heart warmed. "Good. I’m counting on you both."

"Mom," Aaron asked casually, "why hasn’t Uncle Ryan ever married? I wonder what kind of woman would be good enough for him."

Luna’s hands jerked, nearly tipping the winnowing basket. "Your uncle has... high standards."

"Mom!" Ethan suddenly leaned in. "I think Uncle Ryan likes you!"

Clatter—the broom slipped from Luna’s grasp.

"Don’t talk nonsense!" Her ears burned. "What kind of man is your uncle? And what kind of woman am I? If word got out—"

Ethan crossed his arms. "I’m sixteen. I know what I see. Why does he always come here? He says it’s to check on the pigs, but he spends every visit helping you in the yard. The second you lift a water bucket, he snatches it away. If you pick up an axe, he takes it from you—"

"Enough!" Luna stamped her foot, voice sharp. "I’m a divorced woman in this village. That’s shame enough. Never say such things again!"

Seeing their mother’s genuine distress, the boys quickly made excuses. "We’ll go dig up worms for the chickens."

Only after they’d gone did Luna steady herself. Lifting the rough cloth covering the eggs, she froze. Tucked in the corner was a handkerchief—unfolding it revealed a brand-new jar of snowflake cream.

No one but Ryan had touched that basket.

Her nose stung. All those subtle gestures of care over the years had now been laid bare. But what did it matter? Old Man Wallace would never accept his eldest son marrying a widow...

At dusk, Ryan stood by the reservoir as usual, lost in thought, when a familiar scent of soapberries drifted toward him.

"Did you leave this?" Luna opened her palm. The snowflake cream gleamed pearly white under the moonlight.

Ryan feigned ignorance. "Not mine."

"Take it back." She turned to leave. "And don’t come to my house anymore. People will talk."

"Wait." Ryan shot to his feet, voice like ice. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

Luna clenched the hem of her shirt. "I’m divorced with three children. You’re unmarried. It’s not proper for you to keep visiting."

When he took a sudden step forward, she flinched, arms flying up to shield her face. "Don’t hit me!"

Ryan’s outstretched hand froze midair. His eyes reddened. "If I ever raised a hand to a woman, may lightning strike me dead."

The night wind carried the damp scent of water between them, leaving only the weight of their ragged breaths.
###Chapter 216: I Will Marry You

Luna stumbled backward, her cheeks burning with heat. She hadn't expected to lose her composure like this.

"I... I should go!"

She turned to flee, but a pair of strong arms suddenly wrapped around her waist. The man's chest pressed firmly against her back, the heat making her heart tremble.

"Ryan! Have you lost your mind?"

She struggled desperately, her nails leaving red marks on his arms. But those iron-like arms didn't budge. Instead, he spun her around and locked her tightly in his embrace.

Luna trembled all over. The Ryan she knew had always been restrained and proper, maintaining just the right distance even in conversation. But now, he seemed like a completely different person.

"Don't be afraid," Ryan's voice was rough with emotion. "Just let me finish."

The pounding of his heartbeat thundered in her ears. Luna suddenly froze, afraid someone might see them—and even more afraid that her own racing heart would betray her.

"I will marry you."

The four words struck like lightning. Luna jerked her head up, meeting his burning gaze. Under the moonlight, his sharp features were edged with silver, but his eyes held a fire she had never seen before.

"Do you even know what you're saying?" Her voice shook. "The whole village is laughing at me. If you do this—"

"I don't care what they think!" Ryan tightened his arms around her. "For the past six months, I've stood by the reservoir every night just to see the light in your window. Luna, I'm done holding back."

Luna went rigid. She remembered those late nights when she'd felt someone watching from the shadows. It hadn't been her imagination.

"Your father would never agree." She turned her face away, nails digging into her palms. "The Wallaces' standing in the village—I—"

Before she could finish, his lips met hers.

The kiss was fierce and urgent, leaving no room for refusal. Luna's mind went blank, her knees weakening. She should have pushed him away, but her body betrayed her reason.

"If my father objects," Ryan murmured against her forehead, his breathing ragged, "I'll take you and the children away. Luna, you're mine."

The night wind carried a damp chill, but Luna's eyes suddenly burned with unshed tears. She should refuse—but deep down, some part of her had already crumbled at his words.
###Chapter 217: I'm Andrew's Mother, She's His Fiancée

Luna White's fingers tapped lightly on the desk, the faint scent of antiseptic lingering in the clinic. Sunlight streamed through the window, glinting off the metal buttons of her white coat.

"Dr. White, your acupuncture is miraculous!" A soldier with strained back muscles had just left, and Luna was jotting down notes in the medical record when the door burst open.

She looked up to see two well-dressed women standing at the entrance. The older one, in her fifties, wore an elegant navy-blue suit, pearl earrings glowing softly in the sunlight. The younger woman sported a fashionable red dress, her hair in voluminous waves, lips painted a bold crimson.

"Hello, who's here for treatment?" Luna closed the medical record.

"Treatment?" The younger woman scoffed, striding forward in her high heels. "We're not here for that."

Luna arched a brow, fingers absently tracing her pen. This didn’t bode well.

The older woman gently pressed her companion’s arm, her voice calm but firm. "Dr. White, I presume? I'm Fiona Smith, Andrew's mother."

Luna’s heart skipped a beat. Andrew’s mother? She set the pen down smoothly, her gaze shifting between the two.

"And this is Diana, Andrew’s fiancée," Fiona continued, watching Luna’s reaction closely.

The clinic fell silent except for the ticking of the wall clock. A dull ache settled in Luna’s chest, but her expression remained composed. She rose slowly, her coat swaying slightly with the movement.

"What a coincidence," she said with a faint smile. "I’m also Andrew’s fiancée."

Diana’s face flushed red. "That’s a lie! Andrew and I have been engaged since childhood!"

Luna adjusted her sleeve cuffs calmly. "Then you should ask Andrew why he proposed to me." She emphasized the word proposed deliberately.

A flicker of surprise crossed Fiona’s eyes. She hadn’t expected this gentle-looking doctor to be so sharp-tongued.

"Dr. White," Fiona’s tone darkened, "young love is one thing, but marriage isn’t a game. Our family—"

"Aunt Fiona," Luna interrupted, her gaze steady, "this is a new era. Andrew should decide for himself who he marries."

Diana stomped her foot. "Aunt Fiona, look how arrogant she is!"

Luna almost laughed. The scene was straight out of a soap opera—she never thought it would happen to her.

She picked up the appointment slip and slid it toward them. "If there’s nothing else, I have another patient to see."

Fiona’s expression tightened, clearly not expecting to be dismissed so bluntly. She gave Luna a long look before steering Diana out.

The moment the door closed, Luna exhaled sharply, her fingers twisting together. That idiot Andrew—dragging me into this mess!

She pulled out her phone, debating whether to call and confront him. Then she reconsidered—this was a conversation best had face-to-face.

Outside, Fiona and Diana’s figures gradually disappeared. Luna watched them go, already planning how to deal with the troublemaker later.

The clinic door opened again, revealing a soldier leaning on a crutch. "Dr. White, is now a good time for acupuncture?"

Luna immediately switched to her professional smile. "Come in."

She picked up the silver needles, but her thoughts drifted elsewhere. Andrew, you’d better have a damn good explanation.
###Chapter 218: The Mystery of Instructor Andrew's Origins

"Auntie, listen to her tone!" Luna White stomped her foot in frustration. They had assumed this country girl, fresh from the rural exams, would back down with just a little intimidation. Instead, the young woman not only stood her ground but left them speechless.

Luna could only glance pleadingly at Clara White. After all, this was Andrew Smith's mother—surely she deserved some respect as an elder?

Clara studied the girl before her. Dressed in a white coat, her gaze clear and steady, there was no trace of the timidity expected from a village girl. "Dr. White, we'd like to speak with you. If it's convenient, perhaps we could find somewhere to sit?"

Luna checked her wristwatch. "I have one more hour before my shift ends. If you're willing to wait, stay outside." She sighed inwardly. The tension between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was already palpable before their relationship had even begun. That bastard Andrew hadn't even given her a hint about his family background.

Clara nodded. "Very well, we'll wait."

Luna opened her mouth to protest, but a sharp look from Clara silenced her. Reluctantly, she followed her aunt out.

Patients immediately flooded back into the examination room.

"Auntie!" Luna slumped onto the bench outside, her chest tight with anger. "Who does she think she is? A nobody from the countryside, acting so arrogant!"

Clara smoothed the hem of her dress with deliberate calm. "Why lower yourself to squabble with a village girl? Remember your status." She gave her niece a meaningful look. "Your parents raised you better than this."

Luna fell silent. Though Clara was Andrew's mother, she was technically his stepmother. This entire charade was clearly a case of a stepmother meddling in her stepson's marriage.

"I lost my composure," Luna admitted, taking a deep breath. "I didn't expect her to be so difficult."

Clara patted her hand. "I know how long you've loved Andrew. But his temper..." She sighed. "If not for his sudden marriage application, we wouldn't even have known."

Luna's eyes reddened. For Andrew, she had even tried to join the cultural troupe—only to fail the physical exam. All these years, who in the Smith family hadn't known of her feelings?

"That girl isn't simple," Clara murmured, narrowing her eyes. "She didn't even flinch meeting her future mother-in-law."

The clinic door opened and closed repeatedly until finally, the shift ended.

Luna pushed the door open. "Auntie, please come in."

She had considered calling Andrew but stopped herself. He was on an important mission. Was she really so helpless at her age?

The situation was obvious—her future mother-in-law had brought the "intended bride" to intimidate her. What intrigued her more was Clara's demeanor. Andrew's family background was clearly more complicated than he'd let on.

A smirk curled Luna's lips. Instructor Andrew, you've hidden yourself well.

Today, she would uncover the truth about this man.
###Chapter 219: The Confrontation at the Bistro

"Since we're off duty, why not have lunch together? We still have work this afternoon—it won't do to go hungry." Clara Green smiled gently, though her eyes remained distant.

Luna White pressed a hand to her empty stomach. She did need to replenish her energy. Every time she used her acupuncture skills, it drained her supernatural abilities. Without enough fuel, she'd be shivering from the cold by afternoon. She couldn't keep relying on Andrew to act as her personal heater.

"Alright, let me change first." As Luna turned, she caught the faint scoff from Maya. "There aren't any decent restaurants around here. You'll have to make do."

"There's a car waiting outside," Clara said, smoothing her skirt. "There's a bistro not far from here—quiet, perfect for conversation."

A bistro? Luna's eyebrow arched. So this was meant to be a power play.

A black luxury sedan waited outside the hospital. Luna's stomach sank. So Andrew wasn't just some ordinary man who could cook and do laundry—he was the son of a high-ranking official?

The restaurant was elegantly furnished. Under the glow of crystal chandeliers, Clara slid the menu toward her. "Dr. White, what would you like?"

"You choose." Luna kept her expression neutral.

Maya snorted. This country bumpkin probably couldn't even read the menu.

Clara ordered three steak meals. The moment the server left, she cut straight to the point: "Andrew never mentioned having a fiancée."

"Funny, he never mentioned his family either," Luna countered, meeting her gaze. If this woman came looking for a fight, there was no need for pretense.

"Then I'll be blunt." Clara lifted her teacup. "You and Andrew aren't suited for each other."

"Suited or not, that's not for outsiders to decide." Luna tapped the table lightly with her fingertips.

"Andrew's father is a district leader, and he's the favorite youngest son." Clara set down her cup with a sharp clink. "Do you really think you can fit into a family like that?"

The steaks arrived just then. Clara picked up her knife and fork with practiced grace, Maya mimicking her movements like a poorly rehearsed performance.

"Need help?" Clara glanced pointedly at the untouched cutlery before Luna.

Luna calmly picked up her knife and fork. A flash of silver, and the steak was neatly divided into perfect, even pieces. She dipped a bite into the black pepper sauce, her movements fluid and effortless.

Maya's fork clattered onto her plate. How was this possible? That village girl shouldn't know the first thing about dining etiquette!

Clara's eyes narrowed. The plan had just hit an unexpected snag.
###Chapter 220: Poaching

"Auntie, Andrew and I both have our own careers. We'll naturally live separately after marriage." Luna White elegantly cut into her steak, the silverware glinting under the chandelier. "Are you worried about mother-in-law conflicts? There's no need. With your status, surely you wouldn’t stoop to harassing me like some petty gossipmonger?"

Wei Shufen's grip on her wineglass faltered, the liquid trembling.

"Besides..." Luna took a slow, deliberate bite of the tender steak, savoring it before continuing, "whether you approve of me or not—does it matter? What matters is that Andrew wants to marry me." She lifted her gaze, clear and unwavering.

This upscale Western restaurant was indeed her first visit. On her current salary, she couldn’t afford such luxury. But since someone else was footing the bill, she saw no reason not to enjoy the meal.

"Dr. White, you certainly have a sharp tongue," Wei Shufen sneered. "Aren’t you afraid people will say you’re climbing the social ladder?"

"Auntie, you flatter me." Luna chuckled lightly. "Someone of your standing wouldn’t indulge in such petty gossip, would you? These days, we believe in free love." She took a sip of water. "I despise compromising for others’ opinions. What people think means nothing to me."

Wei Shufen narrowed her eyes. This girl was far more formidable than she’d anticipated. If not for her niece, Ding Min...

"Actually..." Wei Shufen suddenly adopted a warm smile. "You’re still young, with limited social circles. I know many promising young men from better families than Andrew—"

"Auntie, are you trying to poach me?"

A cold male voice cut in.

All three turned. Andrew Smith stood at the entrance in his crisp military uniform, his handsome face stormy.

Ding Min immediately rose, cheeks flushed. "Andrew—"

He ignored her, striding straight to Luna and pulling her up. "You could stomach this meal?" His voice was thick with suppressed anger.

Wei Shufen paled. "Andrew!"

He didn’t spare her a glance, wrapping an arm around Luna and leading her out. Patrons turned to watch.

Only when she was shoved into the jeep did Luna snap out of her daze. "How did you know I was here?"

Andrew started the engine, his knuckles whitening. "Xiao Li from the hospital told me." His voice was low. "Wei Shufen loves using these places to intimidate people."

Silence filled the car. Luna stole a glance at his tense profile and suddenly found it amusing.

"Nothing to explain?" She tugged at her seatbelt pointedly. "Like... why your mother was trying to set me up with someone else?"

The car jerked to a stop. Andrew turned, his dark eyes unreadable. "She’s not my birth mother."

Luna arched a brow.

"It’s complicated." He restarted the engine. "Just remember—don’t believe a word she says."

"And if she bullies me?" Luna tilted her head.

His grip on the steering wheel tightened. "There won’t be a next time."

"Earlier..." She leaned closer suddenly. "You rushed here because you were worried about me, didn’t you?"

The tips of his ears reddened visibly. Just as Luna thought he wouldn’t answer, a quiet "Mm" drifted to her.

She froze, then a smile tugged at her lips unbidden. This seemingly unyielding man had an unexpectedly adorable side.
###Chapter 221: Rejection

"Get out, I'm taking you for a proper meal. You barely touched your food earlier."

Andrew Smith held Luna White's hand tightly, his anxious heart finally settling as he took in her slightly flushed cheeks. God knew how terrified he'd been when he heard that Clara White had come looking for her—he'd been afraid she might disappear in a fit of anger.

Luna shook their intertwined hands playfully. "How am I supposed to get out like this?"

Reluctantly, Andrew let go and pointed ahead. "It's right across from the hospital, that little food street."

Luna followed his gaze and frowned. She'd been there a few times—there was nothing worth eating. She should've just made noodles at home instead of going hungry like this.

Andrew led her forward, inwardly disappointed. Between the cafeteria and military duties, he rarely got time alone with her, and now even these stolen moments were slipping away.

"Wait!" Luna suddenly tugged his sleeve, checking her watch. "It's almost time for my shift. No time to eat now."

Andrew smacked his forehead in frustration. "Hold on!" Before she could respond, he was already sprinting away.

Less than five minutes later, he returned, panting, and shoved a greasy paper bag into her hands. "Take this to the office. Don't skip meals."

Luna accepted the still-warm steamed buns and waved. "Gotta go! I'm late!" She dashed toward the hospital without looking back.

Andrew watched until she disappeared, then turned—only to find Clara and Diana standing by his car. Diana's eyes were red-rimmed, as if she'd been crying buckets.

The moment he saw Clara, Andrew's expression turned icy. He remembered all too clearly what had happened to his older brother—kidnapped by traffickers, all because Clara had taken him to the department store and vanished under the pretense of using the restroom. No matter how much she denied it later, his brother never lied.

All these years, Clara had played the dutiful stepmother, fooling everyone except him and his brother. They knew better—she was anything but harmless.

"Andrew, we need to talk," Clara said, stepping forward.

Andrew yanked the car door open. "My business isn't yours to meddle in."

Clara slammed a hand on the door. "Your father sent me. He doesn't approve of you and that little nurse!"

"My father?" Andrew scoffed. "He's never cared about status. But you—you've been pushing Diana at me from the start. What's your game?"

"You're up for promotion next year—a twenty-seven-year-old officer with a bright future!" Clara pressed, feigning concern. "Diana comes from a good family. She could help your career—"

"Enough!" Andrew cut her off sharply. "I'll say this one last time—I'm marrying Luna. As for the marriage application—" His gaze turned razor-sharp. "If my father won't approve it, I'll file for discharge instead!"

The car door slammed shut, and the SUV roared to life, kicking up dust as it sped away.

Clara stood frozen, her face unreadable. Diana timidly tugged her sleeve. "Auntie… what now?"

"Patience," Clara murmured, eyes narrowing. "As long as the old man doesn't budge, this wedding won't happen."
###Chapter 222: Grocery Shopping Incident

Ding Min stomped her feet in frustration, her nails digging deep into her palms. Andrew Smith didn't even spare her a glance as he walked right past her.

"Auntie, did you see that..." Ding Min tugged at Wei Shufen's sleeve, her voice laced with grievance.

Wei Shufen narrowed her eyes at the hospital entrance and let out a cold laugh. "What's the hurry? Men are all like this—it's just a passing infatuation." She patted Ding Min's hand reassuringly. "Once they're apart long enough, even the deepest feelings will fade. And then..."

"Then that bitch Luna White won't be able to hold on!" Ding Min's eyes lit up. "We should have her transferred to the borderlands—let's see how she seduces Andrew then!"

Wei Shufen shook her head. This girl was still too naive. But it didn't matter. With her as Ding Min's aunt, she'd make sure her niece got her man back.

The two left the hospital in sullen silence.

Luna tidied up the examination room as light snow drifted outside the window. With the New Year approaching, the number of patients in the Traditional Medicine Department had dwindled, and the hospital had granted her a two-week leave.

"Dr. White, heading out?" Nurse Li peeked in.

Just as Luna removed her white coat, the phone rang.

"Acupuncture Department, Ninth Hospital," she answered.

Andrew's deep voice came through the receiver. "Luna, I'm at the hospital entrance."

Her heart skipped a beat. Lately, every call from him sent her pulse racing.

"I'll be right there." Hanging up, she couldn't suppress the smile tugging at her lips.

Outside the hospital gates, Andrew stood in the snow, his military coat dusted with flakes. The stern lines of his face softened into a smile as he spotted Luna hurrying toward him.

"Why aren't you wearing a scarf?" He unwound his own and wrapped it around her neck.

Luna buried her face in the warmth of the fabric, inhaling the mingled scents of tobacco and crisp pine. Her ears burned.

"Let's go grocery shopping. I'll cook for you," she suggested.

Andrew's gaze darkened. He'd planned to take her to a movie, but... a home-cooked meal from her sounded just as good.

The market was nearly closing, so they quickly picked up potatoes, cabbage, and meat. Andrew carried the heavy cloth bag, watching Luna's cheeks flush from the cold. Unable to resist, he reached for her icy hand.

"Let's get home," he murmured.

At the dormitory entrance, they ran into little Feng. The girl greeted them sweetly. "Hello, Auntie Luna!"

Since the incident, Feng had moved here with her mother, Lily Collins, and had grown much more cheerful. Lily often sent over homemade pastries, and the two families had grown close.

"You've gotten taller, Feng," Luna said, ruffling her hair affectionately.

As they climbed the stairs, Andrew suddenly leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Next time... could we go to the movies?"

Luna's foot slipped, but he caught her steady. Their eyes met, and both flushed crimson.
###Chapter 223: The Flirt Who Got Flirted Back

Luna White pushed the door open and waved at Andrew Smith. "Come in quick, it's freezing outside."

A rush of warm air instantly dispelled the chill. The heating in the expert's building was impressively efficient—the entire room was cozy and warm, a stark contrast to the subzero temperatures outside.

"Much better in here," Luna sighed as she unwrapped her scarf. The northern winter was far colder than anything she'd experienced back home.

Andrew carried several bags into the kitchen, his lips quirking at the spotless stove. "Looks like Dr. White doesn't cook much."

"Of course not. The cafeteria's convenient enough." Luna shrugged off her coat, revealing a fitted beige turtleneck sweater. Having been reborn, she refused to settle for less. With her current salary and bonuses totaling over 150 yuan a month—a considerable income in 1985—she could afford to dress well. She ran her fingers over the sweater's fabric with satisfaction. It was the latest style from the department store.

"Today, I'll show you what I can do," she declared, rolling up her sleeves as she entered the kitchen.

Andrew was unpacking groceries when Luna swiftly washed her hands and grabbed a knife to slice meat.

"Andrew, help me tie this apron," she said, nodding toward the floral-patterned one hanging on the wall. "It's been so long since I cooked, I forgot about it."

Andrew stepped behind her, his arms encircling her waist. The position was almost like an embrace, sending a warm thrill through him. His deft fingers tied the apron strings, deliberately lingering for an extra second.

"Done."

Unaware, Luna cheerfully announced, "Today's menu is boiled sliced pork, stir-fried shredded potatoes, millet porridge, and steamed buns. How's that?"

"I'll eat anything you make," Andrew replied, already rinsing rice for the porridge.

Luna shot him a sidelong glance. "Since when did Captain Smith become so smooth?"

"Just stating facts." His deadpan expression made her laugh.

Once the porridge was on the stove, Luna nudged him. "Go watch TV in the living room. I've got this."

"I'll be your assistant," Andrew said, rolling up his sleeves to wash vegetables. "The evening news isn't half as interesting as watching you cook."

As she chopped meat, Luna asked curiously, "Andrew, your father's a high-ranking official, right? How come you don’t act like a typical privileged kid?"

Andrew efficiently rinsed cabbage leaves. "Are privileged kids not human? I’ve been in the military for years—I’m used to doing things myself. Besides—" He winked at her. "A man who can cook is attractive, isn’t he?"

Luna burst out laughing. "Is Captain Smith complimenting himself now?"

"Just stating facts," he repeated, making her laugh harder.

After washing the cabbage, Andrew filled a basin with warm water. "Girls shouldn’t handle cold water." He carefully tested the temperature before handing it to her.

Touched, Luna suddenly leaned in and kissed his stubbled chin. The rough texture tickled her lips, but before she could gloat, she found herself pinned against the door.

"A-Andrew..." Her voice trembled.

One of his hands cuffed her wrists above her head while the other claimed her lips in a deep, urgent kiss that left her legs weak.

"Still feeling playful?" His breathing was steady, as if the passionate moment hadn’t affected him at all.

Blushing, Luna shook her head. This time, the flirt had definitely been outplayed.
###Chapter 224: Warmth

Dinner was unusually quiet. Luna White behaved like a timid quail, no longer daring to provoke Andrew Smith. The man learned too quickly—now the student had outdone the teacher, leaving her utterly subdued.

As soon as the meal ended, Luna moved to wash the dishes, but Andrew had already gathered the bowls with swift efficiency. The kettle on the stove steamed; he had prepared hot water for her bath long before.

"Go ahead," he said without looking up, his hands never pausing.

Watching his busy figure, warmth bloomed in Luna’s chest. A man like this—perhaps the heavens had sent him to compensate for the hardships of her past life. Even the side effects of her supernatural ability seemed subdued in his presence.

"Then I’ll go," she murmured, carrying the basin toward the bathroom.

Andrew intercepted her in one stride. "It’s hot. Let me."

"I’m not made of porcelain," Luna grumbled, though her heart swelled with sweetness.

"To me, you are." His tone brooked no argument. "Once we’re married, these chores are mine. A wife is meant to be cherished, not put to work."

Luna smiled, eyes crinkling. "You said it yourself." The coy look made Andrew’s throat tighten, nearly pressing her against the wall again.

Sensing the danger in his gaze, Luna quickly loosened her hair and fetched a stool to test the water. But Andrew took the ladle. "Let me wash it for you."

Before she could protest, warm water cascaded over her long tresses. His fingers combed through with perfect pressure, and Luna gradually relaxed, surrendering to his care.

Shampoo suds rinsed away bit by bit. Andrew wrapped her damp hair in a towel, handling her like precious treasure. The faint floral scent tangled in her strands made his breath hitch.

"Done," he said, voice rough. "I’ll heat more water. Dry your hair."

Seated in the living room, Luna barely registered the TV drama The Legend of the Condor Heroes. Her thoughts lingered on the figure in the kitchen. Being treasured like this stung her eyes with unshed tears.

When Andrew returned with a basin of warm water for her feet, he was already wearing his coat.

"You’re leaving?" Luna glanced outside. The wind howled; snow was forecast.

"Mm. Rest early."

She bit her lip. "It’s so late… Maybe you should stay." Her ears burned the moment the words left her mouth.

Andrew’s gaze darkened before he chuckled. "I’ll take the sofa."

By the time he emerged from the bathroom, Luna had brought out a quilt. Their eyes met—then darted away. The air hummed with the scent of shampoo and something wordless, electric.

That night, the storm rattled the windows, but nothing could dispel the warmth inside.
###Chapter 225: A Guilty Conscience

Luna White emerged from the bedroom with an armful of blankets, tossing a pillow onto the sofa. She stared at the two-seater couch, her brow furrowing—how could Andrew Smith, all six feet of him, possibly stretch out comfortably on that tiny thing?

Andrew leaned against the doorframe, his intense gaze fixed on her slender figure as she bustled about. The way her waist swayed with each movement made his throat tighten involuntarily.

The sound of approaching footsteps made Luna pause mid-motion. She pretended to focus on fluffing the blankets, her heart pounding. Why did the air between them feel so charged? She hadn’t done anything wrong, yet she couldn’t shake the feeling of being caught in some illicit act.

"The sofa’s too small," she blurted. "Maybe I should take it instead."

"No." Andrew’s refusal was firm. "I’ll sleep here."

Luna glanced at her watch—nearly eleven. She peeked at Andrew and caught him staring at her freshly washed hair, the dark strands cascading over her shoulders, gleaming softly under the light.

"Well… I’m going to bed." She practically fled into the bedroom, locking the door behind her with a decisive click.

She flopped onto the bed, tossing and turning. Logically, she knew Andrew wasn’t the type to overstep, but locking the door gave her an inexplicable sense of security. The mattress was too soft, the room too quiet—her own heartbeat thundered in her ears.

Midnight thirst drove her to tiptoe to the kitchen for water. The living room TV flickered with static, and Andrew lay sprawled on the sofa, one arm draped over his eyes, his long legs dangling awkwardly over the armrest. Moonlight spilled through the window, tracing the sharp angles of his face.

Before she knew it, Luna found herself tiptoeing closer, gently tucking the blanket around him. Her fingers accidentally brushed his cheek—the warmth sent a jolt through her. How was this ridiculously handsome man her fiancé? She stifled a giggle and scurried back to her room, missing the faint smirk that curled his lips.

The next morning, Luna slept in until the sun was high. She pulled back the curtains to a world blanketed in snow, flakes still drifting lazily from the sky, the silence almost surreal.

The dining table was set with steaming bowls of millet porridge, fried dough sticks, and tea eggs. Andrew emerged from the kitchen with two sets of chopsticks. "Go wash up. I’ve got hot water ready for you."

Luna’s heart warmed at the sight of this domestic version of him.

"Did you buy these?" she asked, biting into a crispy dough stick.

"Yeah, fresh from the vendor." He nudged a steamed bun toward her. "After breakfast, we’ll build a snowman."

Luna nearly choked. "Captain Andrew, how old are you again?"

"Anyone who laughs runs ten kilometers," he shot back, eyes crinkling with amusement.

Their banter was cut short by urgent knocking.

"Luna! Open up!" Ethan White’s booming voice carried through the door.

Her hand jerked, dropping the dough stick into her porridge. She shot Andrew a panicked look, as if they’d been caught in some scandal. But Andrew merely strode to the door, unruffled.

"Andrew?" Ethan brushed snow off his coat. "What are you doing here?"

"Breakfast." Andrew’s expression didn’t waver.

Ethan glanced at the wall clock—10:30 a.m. He clapped Andrew on the shoulder with sudden understanding. "Perfect. I haven’t eaten either."

Only then did Luna realize—who would suspect anything over a late breakfast? Flushing, she ducked her head over her porridge, chiding herself for being so ridiculously guilty over nothing.
###Chapter 226: A Blessing from Past Lives

Luna had just set the table when Ethan burst through the door with his usual energy.

"Ethan?" Luna's face lit up as she rushed to greet him.

He grabbed a fried dough stick and took a big bite. "Got leave today. Came to see you. Went to your department—Xiao Li said you were off." He swallowed before adding, "So, when are you heading home for New Year's?"

Luna handed him a steaming bowl of millet porridge. "I have two weeks off."

"Perfect! The CO approved my leave too." Ethan gulped down half the bowl in one go. "Don't worry about train tickets—our captain's got connections."

"Let's leave next Monday then." Luna calculated. "We can pick up some local specialties." She made a mental note to get red ginseng for her sister and dried mushrooms for her foster parents.

Suddenly, Ethan turned to Andrew. "So, Andrew, what's your family situation?" As the eldest brother, he needed answers.

Andrew set down his chopsticks. "My family's in Kyoto. My mother passed early. Father remarried—my stepmother has no children of her own. Three brothers total. I'm the middle one. My elder brother's married with a four-year-old son. Younger brother's a journalist."

"Stepmother?" Ethan's brow furrowed. "Will Luna get treated badly there?" He locked eyes with Andrew. "We country folk speak plain. But Luna's got looks and talent—I won't stand for her being mistreated."

Andrew met his gaze steadily. "You have my word. We'll settle here after marriage, rarely visit Kyoto. Even if we do, I'd never let Luna suffer any slight."

Ethan punched Andrew's shoulder. "Good! Remember what you said today." He turned to Luna. "If he ever hurts you, I'll be the first to deal with him."

Luna's eyes grew moist. This brother—in this life and surely the last—had always cherished her like a treasure.

She suddenly realized: this must be a blessing accumulated over lifetimes.

Foster parents who loved her as their own. Siblings who treated her better than blood. After experiencing life's cruelties, such unconditional love felt more precious than ever.

"Ethan..." Her voice caught.

Ethan shoved a steamed bun into his mouth. "What're you crying for? I just want you happy." He chewed loudly on purpose. "Damn, these buns are good!"

"Since we're all free today, I'll cook something special." Luna wiped her eyes. "Give me your clothes to wash—they'll dry by tomorrow. Stay the night. We've got catching up to do."

Ethan grinned. "Getting spoiled by my little sister before I even get a wife." He winked at Andrew. "Isn't my sister the best? Lucky bastard."

Andrew's gaze softened as it rested on Luna. "I must've done something righteous in a past life."

"You two!" Luna's cheeks flushed pink.

The room filled with joyous laughter, warm enough to melt hearts.
###Chapter 227: Midnight Visitors

Luna White had just finished clearing the dishes when urgent knocking echoed at the door.

"Who could it be at this hour?" She glanced out the window, where two shadowy figures stood amidst the swirling snow.

Andrew Smith took the dishcloth from her hands. "I'll get it."

As the door opened, a gust of icy wind swept in, carrying snowflakes. Outside stood two well-dressed men—one elderly with an air of authority, the other young and refined behind gold-rimmed glasses.

"Is Dr. White home?" the younger man asked urgently.

Luna peered out from behind Andrew. "That's me. Who are—"

"Dr. White!" The young man seized her hand, his voice trembling. "It's Nathaniel Smith! You saved my life!"

Recognition flickered in Luna's eyes—the memory of a dying young man resurfaced. Before she could respond, Andrew ushered them inside with a warm smile. "Nathaniel, come in out of the cold."

A driver followed, unloading gift boxes that soon crowded the table. Luna frowned. "Mr. Smith, this is—"

"Please don't misunderstand," Nathaniel interjected. "This is Minister Jiang. We're here to ask for your help."

Minister Jiang stepped forward and bowed deeply. "Dr. White, my father is critically ill. We beg you to save him."

Luna's pulse quickened. She studied the minister's face—his eyes brimmed with desperation.

"Minister Jiang, I'm just an ordinary doctor—"

"Dr. White!" His voice cracked. "He's in the ICU. The hospitals... they say..." He choked on the words.

Nathaniel finished softly, "His condition resembles mine when you treated me. We have nowhere else to turn."

Luna looked to Andrew, who gave a slight nod. She drew a steadying breath. "Where's the patient?"

"Capital City," Minister Jiang said hastily. "A private jet stands ready."

Her gaze shifted to the storm raging outside, then to the mountain of gifts. Something told her this wouldn't be simple.

"I need to prepare." Turning toward the bedroom, her fingers tightened around the hem of her shirt.
###Chapter 228: While Parents Live, Life Still Has Roots

"Please calm down first and tell me about your father's condition in detail," Luna White reassured, sensing the family member's urgency that suggested the patient might be critically ill.

Jiang Zhijie composed himself, wiping his face. "My apologies, I'm just overwhelmed. Three months ago, my mother passed away. My father was deeply devoted to her, and two months ago, he suddenly fell into a coma. The hospital diagnosed him with hypertension exacerbated by emotional distress, leading to cardiac overload and organ failure."

Luna nodded—this case seemed less severe than Nathaniel Smith's. "I'll need to request leave from the hospital first."

"No need to worry!" Jiang interjected hastily. "Dean Zhang and I are old friends. The plane is ready—we can depart immediately."

"Now?" Luna glanced outside at the heavy snowfall.

"All necessities are prepared. The aircraft is on standby," Jiang replied, clearly having planned ahead.

Andrew Smith frowned at Nathaniel. "Is it safe to fly in this weather?"

Nathaniel offered an awkward smile. "Don't worry, Andrew. President Jiang is the vice chancellor of an aviation university. Safety is guaranteed. I'll accompany them the entire way."

Only then did Luna realize this man was the same Vice President Jiang who had nearly become her university's leader. Fate worked in strange ways.

"I'll pack my things," she said, turning away—only for Andrew to pull Nathaniel aside.

"She's in your hands," Andrew muttered under his breath. "If a single hair on her head is harmed, I'm holding you accountable."

Nathaniel gave a wry smile. "Understood. If anything happens to her, I'll answer with my life."

Meanwhile, President Jiang was on the phone. "Dean Zhang, it's Jiang... I need to borrow Dr. White for a few days... My father's been comatose for two months..."

Luna quickly packed a few essentials before adding, "President Jiang, I’d like to bring an assistant—Dr. Li from our department."

Jiang nodded eagerly, continuing his plea into the phone. "And a resident doctor... Please, my father doesn’t have much time..."

Hanging up, a shadow of despair crossed Jiang’s eyes. Over the past two months, he’d consulted every renowned specialist in the country—all to no avail. Seeking out Luna was his last desperate hope.

After his mother’s passing, he’d truly understood the agony of "filial piety delayed until it’s too late." His five sons were all accomplished, yet none had managed the simplest act of companionship. Now, with their father’s life hanging by a thread, the brothers had become frantic in their search for a cure.

Gazing at the snowstorm outside, Jiang recalled his father’s favorite saying: While parents live, life still has roots; once they’re gone, only the journey home remains.

How he wished time could flow backward.
###Chapter 229: The One Who Closed Her Eyes

Andrew Smith pulled Luna White into a shadowed corner, his brow furrowed. No one understood better than him the price she paid each time she used her supernatural ability to heal. If possible, he'd take her place in a heartbeat.

"Everything's ready," he murmured, pulling a bulging satchel from his backpack. "Electric vest, chocolates, cocoa powder—all packed. The cocoa works better than brown sugar water. This vest is the latest prototype, not even on the market yet."

His voice dropped lower, eyes darkening. "Remember, your life matters more than anyone else's. If there's danger—"

"I know," Luna rose on her tiptoes, her whisper brushing his ear like silk. "I'm very attached to living."

That liquid-soft tone was reserved only for him.

Ethan White approached, resting a heavy hand on his sister's shoulder. The siblings exchanged a silent glance that spoke volumes.

Three hours later, the military jeep roared into the capital.

"My God!" Little Jack pressed against the window. "This courtyard's bigger than our county hospital!"

Luna studied the imposing quadrangle compound through narrowed eyes. Blue-gray bricks, carved beams—in 1985, only the elite could afford such a residence.

"Dr. White?" Principal Jiang approached with a young man in a Mao suit. "This is my nephew, Jayden Jiang."

Luna's pupils contracted.

Jayden Jiang!

The man who'd closed her lifeless eyes in her past life. The future titan of commerce. She never expected to meet him here.

Memories surged like a tidal wave—this was the man who'd risked everything trying to free her during her imprisonment. The same hands that had gently shut her eyelids for the last time...

"Dr. White?" Jayden tilted his head at the dazed young woman.

Luna snapped back to the present, her lips curving into a knowing smile.

Grace Wen, your reckoning has arrived.
###Chapter 230: Skepticism

"Good day, Mr. Jiang."

Luna White gave a slight nod, her gaze steady as she regarded the man before her.

Jiang Shaoqing acknowledged her with a cool nod. "Dr. White, follow me." He gestured with detached politeness, his tone distant.

The university president hurried after them, his brow furrowed. "How has the old man been these past two days?"

"Not well." Jiang Shaoqing shook his head, his voice heavy. "Experts from across the country have examined him, and they all say the same thing—he's in a vegetative state. Some claim he might wake tomorrow, others say he may never regain consciousness."

He paused, casting a pointed glance at Luna. "The last doctor we consulted was a renowned traditional physician, descended from imperial court doctors. He administered acupuncture twice—to no effect."

Luna pressed her lips together. The implied jab was unmistakable.

They passed through a corridor and entered the inner courtyard. The moment the door opened, the thick scent of medicinal herbs and stale air assaulted them. Luna couldn't help but frown.

Several elderly physicians were gathered around the bed, engaged in heated debate.

"I told you acupuncture was a mistake! Now not only is the old man still unconscious, but his mouth is twisted too! Some 'renowned physician'—more like a quack!"

"One wrong move with acupuncture can be fatal. At his age, he shouldn't risk his reputation like this."

The university president paled and pushed through the crowd. "Let me see!"

Luna followed, falling into step beside Jiang Shaoqing. The man deliberately shifted half a step away, his eyes filled with distrust.

The elderly man on the bed was gaunt, his once-peaceful face now distorted by a lopsided mouth. Drool trickled down his chin.

The president took a towel from a nurse and wiped his father's face with trembling hands. For the first time, he questioned his decision to bring Luna here.

"President Jiang," one of the senior doctors said gravely, "the old man can't endure any more reckless treatments. It's best to avoid unverified remedies from so-called miracle workers."

Xiao Li couldn't stay silent. "Dr. White is formally employed by the military hospital!"

Every eye turned toward them.

Luna stepped forward calmly. "President Jiang, may I examine him?"

Her composure eased the president's nerves slightly, and he moved aside.

Luna took the old man's frail wrist. As her supernatural ability flowed through her, the diagnosis became clear—rage and grief had festered into illness. The old man chose not to wake. The previous doctor's acupuncture hadn't been wrong; it had merely unblocked one meridian while another remained obstructed.

"He can be treated," she said, looking up.

The president's eyes widened with hope. "How?"

"Acupuncture."

The moment the word left her lips, the senior physicians' expressions darkened.

"President Jiang," the lead doctor said sternly, "we've said all we can. If you insist on letting an inexperienced girl experiment, we can no longer oversee this case. Goodbye."

The president hesitated, glancing at his nephew for guidance.

Jiang Shaoqing slowly shook his head.
###Chapter 231: A Pair of Fools

"Please wait, doctors! My grandfather's condition still requires your attention. We can't let him remain like this..." Nathaniel Smith's words were abruptly cut off by a sudden exclamation.

"Oh my God! What are you doing?"
"Stop that immediately!"
"This is absolute madness!"

The specialists' faces turned pale as they pointed behind Nathaniel.

He whirled around, his pupils contracting sharply.

Luna White had somehow appeared beside the hospital bed, two gleaming silver needles already embedded in the old man's head. The trembling needle tips made Nathaniel's eyes sting.

"Luna!" he roared. "If anything happens to my grandfather, I'll make you pay with your life! Someone call the police!"

His gaze locked onto Luna's fingers gripping the needles, not daring to move recklessly. Though he knew nothing about medicine, he understood that even the slightest mistake in acupuncture could be fatal.

A young assistant named Jack swiftly stepped between Nathaniel and Luna. "Don't interfere with Dr. White! Quickly, prepare blankets and hot water!"

"Get out of my way!" Nathaniel's temples bulged with fury. "You're all in this together!"

Nathaniel Smith grabbed his arm urgently. "Fourth Brother, Luna is Andrew's fiancée—she saved my life!"

"Even you..." Nathaniel shook off his grip, his eyes filled with disappointment.

The room descended into chaos. The specialists exchanged uneasy glances, too afraid to intervene yet unwilling to leave. The hospital director, his face ashen, discreetly signaled his secretary to summon security.

Seeing no one willing to help, Jack turned to Nathaniel. "Dr. White needs hot water and thick blankets!"

Nathaniel clenched his jaw and dashed out of the room.

Moments later, he returned with blankets and a thermos. Jack swiftly prepared a cup of hot cocoa, its rich aroma filling the ward.

"Preposterous!" one specialist couldn't hold back. "How can a patient drink this?"
"This is sheer recklessness!"
"This isn't treatment—it's outright harm!"

The hospital director regretted his decision deeply. He made a subtle gesture, and several security guards took positions by the door.

Luna's face grew increasingly pale. With practiced movements, she withdrew the needles, her voice weak. "Electric vest... chocolate..."

Jack acted swiftly, draping the heated vest over her and plugging it in before bundling her tightly in blankets. He pressed the hot cocoa and chocolate into her hands—every motion seamless.

The room fell deathly silent.

Everyone stared in stunned disbelief.

This wasn't medicine—it was...

"A cheap trick!" Nathaniel sneered. "Did you really think this would fool anyone?"

The specialists shook their heads in dismay. The hospital director's expression darkened like storm clouds.

Then—a soft cough came from the bed.

"Water..."

Though barely audible, the sound struck the room like thunder.

All heads turned in unison.

Old Mr. Smith's eyes fluttered open, his lips moving weakly.

"Nathaniel..."

Nathaniel froze as if struck by lightning, his legs giving way as he collapsed to his knees beside the bed.

"Grandfather!"
###Chapter 232: Could Andrew Be Her Antidote?

Nathaniel watched in disbelief as Luna abandoned the old man and curled up in a corner. His blood boiled with fury. The bodyguards summoned by the headmaster stood ready, their professional instincts sensing trouble despite not knowing the full situation.

Anyone could see what was happening.

Another quack doctor must have botched the treatment. Last time, a charlatan's acupuncture left the old man's face twisted, and they'd beaten him half to death. If not for the so-called medical authority's intervention today, that fraud would still be rotting in jail.

Did someone actually dare to swindle the Smith family again?

The bodyguards stood stone-faced, awaiting orders.

"Throw this con artist out! She's banned from the Smith estate!" Nathaniel checked his grandfather first—thankfully, though needled again, the old man showed no seizures or life-threatening signs.

Wait.

Something felt off. Nathaniel turned to inspect more closely.

"Who... are you... throwing out?"

The weak but familiar voice made Nathaniel's eyes redden instantly. He whirled around to see the old man on the bed now awake, his cloudy gaze filled with its usual warmth.

"Grandfather!"

"Father!"

Both Nathaniel and the headmaster rushed to the bedside, each gripping one of the old man's hands. Words failed them as emotion choked their throats. After consulting countless specialists—60% declaring the old man vegetative, the remaining 40% helpless—they'd prepared for the worst. Despite the coma, his vitals had been deteriorating. Experts agreed he wouldn't last much longer.

Yet now, he was awake!

"Stop... fussing... That girl... is remarkable... She saved me..." The old man spoke haltingly, still weak. "You... usually so composed... Why so reckless... today?"

Nathaniel wiped his tears and nodded solemnly. "I was wrong, Grandfather. Dr. White is our family's savior. I'll apologize immediately."

For his grandfather's awakening, he'd do anything.

Nathaniel always settled debts clearly. He strode to where Luna huddled and dropped to his knees. "Dr. White, I was blind not to recognize your skill, lumping you with those frauds. From today onward, you're the Smith family's benefactor. Whatever you need, I'll move heaven and earth to provide it!"

Luna shivered, barely lifting her head. "Nathaniel... remember... your words..." Her teeth chattered. "Get up... This is... unbecoming..."

She'd wanted this promise all along.

Nathaniel rose swiftly, suddenly finding the pale girl before him remarkably admirable. Not only was her medical skill extraordinary, but her magnanimity also suited his temperament perfectly.

He vowed silently to protect her at all costs.

With the Smith family's influence, safeguarding one doctor should be effortless.

"Sister-in-law, are you alright?" Nathaniel hurried over. When Andrew mentioned Luna nearly dying after healing someone, he'd thought it exaggerated. Witnessing it now, he understood Andrew's concern.

Then it hit him—this was Andrew's fiancée!

His spirits dampened. The Smiths' influence matched the Andrews'. If Andrew protected her, what use were the Smiths?

"I'm fine... just... drained..." Luna noticed the cold receding faster than usual. Though she'd held back this time, her recovery still seemed unusually quick.

A thought struck her.

Recently, her post-ability discomfort only eased when Andrew was nearby.

Could it be... Andrew was her antidote?
###Chapter 233: Luck

Jiang Shaoqing turned to the elderly man with urgent eyes, his voice trembling slightly as he addressed Luna White. "Dr. White, my grandfather...?"

Luna glanced at the stunned specialists around her and replied softly, "I've done all I can. Now, it's up to the specialists to provide medication and medical treatment—that's beyond my expertise." She paused. "Acupuncture is merely supplementary. Western medicine is the key. Please have the specialists examine him immediately."

She had long learned to control her supernatural ability. Now, she always left room in her treatments, only alleviating some symptoms. This way, she wouldn’t draw too much attention while still helping the patient.

Jiang Shaoqing immediately called the specialists. "Everyone, please check on my grandfather right away!"

The specialists swarmed forward, their curiosity piqued. Treating a comatose patient had always been a medical challenge. If acupuncture could truly work such wonders...

Jiang Shaoqing didn’t linger. He hurried out to call his family.

Luna felt much warmer now. Unwrapping the blanket, she spotted the heated vest and couldn’t help but smile. Andrew Smith, that blockhead, had actually been this thoughtful. Thinking of their serendipitous connection, she took a sip of hot cocoa, warmth spreading through her body.

Meanwhile, the specialists were in a frenzy.

After examining the old man, Director Zhang stole a glance at Luna. Though the elderly man had regained consciousness, his organ functions remained weak. Still, the stroke symptoms had vanished. That this young woman had achieved such results with just two needles was nothing short of astonishing.

"Quite the stroke of luck," Dean Xu muttered under his breath.

The specialists exchanged knowing looks. Whether it was coincidence or not, the Jiang family would surely remember this favor.

They quickly administered IV fluids and medication before tactfully withdrawing.

Exhausted, the old man soon drifted back into sleep.

Principal Jiang panicked, sidling up to Luna. "Dr. White, is he...?"

"It’s fine. This is normal rest," Luna reassured him. "Let him sleep properly. When he wakes tomorrow, prepare some congee—small, frequent meals."

Only then did Principal Jiang relax, shame creeping into his voice. "Dr. White, earlier, I..."

"Go prepare what he needs," Luna gently interrupted. "Right now, what he needs most is his family by his side."

Principal Jiang nodded, his face flushed. Such a simple truth, yet they—his own children—had failed to grasp it, while this young woman understood perfectly.

Suddenly, the door burst open as the Jiang family’s four sons rushed in.

Luna tactfully stepped out with Xiao Li.

In the hallway, Jiang Shaoqing, having just finished his call, spotted her and immediately approached. "Dr. White, why are you out here? It’s cold!"

Luna gestured toward the noisy room. "Too many people inside."

Jiang Shaoqing promptly summoned a maid. "Prepare the best room for Dr. White. See to her every need."

After thanking him, Luna followed the maid away. She’d undoubtedly be staying the night.

Jiang Shaoqing watched her leave before finally lifting the curtain to check on his grandfather.
###Chapter 234: The Old Trickster's Prank

Luna White froze in the doorway, stunned by the scene before her.

The room was eerily silent. Old General Jiang lay motionless on the hospital bed, his chest barely rising with each shallow breath.

"Uncle, is Grandpa...?" Her voice dropped to a whisper as her fingers twisted the hem of her blouse.

Principal Jiang's expression was grave but controlled. "Dr. White said he needs rest. He probably won't wake until morning."

Jiang Zhiguo held his father's hand, thumb tracing the deep wrinkles. "As long as Dad wakes up. We'll take turns watching over him."

"Agreed," Principal Jiang glanced around. "Dr. White suggested we discuss arrangements for Father's care after this. Since Mother passed, him living alone here isn't..."

Before he could finish, his wife Fang Yuan gently interrupted, "Let's talk outside. We shouldn't disturb him." She gave her husband a meaningful look.

Jiang Zhiguo nodded. "Shaoling will stay with Grandfather. Everyone else, come to the study."

Within moments, only Jiang Shaoling remained in the room. Watching his grandfather's peaceful face and listening to the soft snoring, some tension finally left his shoulders.

Returning to the guest room, Luna gaped at the luxurious setup—private bathroom, 24-hour hot water—unheard of extravagance in 1985. As warm water washed away her fatigue, she mentally noted tomorrow's shopping trip to Wangfujing for those trendy bell-bottoms her sister wanted.

Dawn had barely broken when urgent knocking startled her awake.

The hospital room buzzed with tension. Specialists clustered around the bed, baffled. The monitors showed normal readings, yet the old general refused to wake.

"Dr. White!" Jiang Shaoling rushed forward, all former arrogance gone. "Should we try acupuncture again?"

Luna checked the pulse—then suddenly laughed. "General, pretending to sleep isn't funny. If you don't wake up soon, Colonel Jiang might actually cry."

The "patient's" eyes flew open, sharp and alert. "How'd you see through it, girl?"

Gasps filled the room.

Shaoling stomped his foot. "Grandfather! Do you know how worried we were?"

"Serves you right!" The old man grinned like a mischievous boy. "None of you visit me normally!"

Luna took a subtle step back. This wasn't the stern military leader—this was a full-blown trickster.

"Girl, come here!" The general beckoned suddenly. "You saved this old man's life."

Under the room's intense scrutiny, Luna's ears burned. She approached cautiously—only for the general to seize her wrist.

"Sir, I only—"

"None of that!" His glare could've felled trees. "You dragged me back from Death's door. The Jiang family won't forget this debt."

Luna's breath caught. The weight behind those words rang crystal clear.
###Chapter 235: A Clash of Wills

"Don't stand on ceremony with this old man, girl." Old Master Jiang leaned against the headboard, his eyes bright as he patted the edge of the bed. "I may have been lying here for ages, but my mind's sharp as ever. When those quacks had me drooling and cross-eyed with their needles, I swore if I ever woke up, I'd give them a good slap!"

Luna White pressed her lips together in a faint smile, her fingers lightly tracing the embroidery of her needle case.

"If it weren't for your quick thinking, I might never have opened my eyes again," the old man continued before suddenly turning stern toward Jiang Zhiguo and the others. "Mark my words—Dr. White is the Jiang family's benefactor! From now on, if she ever needs help—as long as it's legal and honorable—you'd better move heaven and earth for her!"

Luna's heart skipped a beat. The old man was laying it on thick—she’d only wanted to secure the Jiang family’s favor.

"You flatter me," she said softly. "Since your condition has improved, I should return. The hospital is expecting me."

Jiang Zhiguo quickly interjected, "Dr. White, why not stay until tomorrow? I’ll arrange a car for you." His eyes darted nervously—clearly, he still feared a relapse.

Luna understood. If she didn’t prove her skills today, she wouldn’t be leaving.

"Then I’ll perform another round of acupuncture," she said, drawing a silver needle that gleamed coldly under the light. "It won’t cure you completely, but it’ll speed up your recovery."

The specialists in the room stiffened. Director Zhang was the first to bristle. "President Jiang, the old master has organ failure. What good will acupuncture do?"

Dean Xu added with a sneer, "Oh, Director Zhang, maybe the young lady has real talent."

Director Zhang’s mustache quivered in outrage. "The old master can’t even get out of bed! Without weeks of treatment, there’s no chance of improvement!" He glared at Luna. "Girl, if you’re trying to climb the ladder by stepping on experts, you’d better know your place!"

Luna blinked. What had she done? She’d only offered to administer acupuncture.

"Dr. White, what do you think...?" President Jiang looked at her uncertainly.

Unfazed, Luna twirled the needle between her fingers. "Director Zhang is right—the old master does need long-term care. This session is just supplementary, stimulating his immune system to accelerate recovery by fifty percent." She paused. "At the very least, he’ll be able to take a few steps today."

"Preposterous!" Director Zhang slammed the table. "No matter how miraculous Chinese medicine is, one needle won’t make an organ failure patient walk!"

Luna said nothing, only gently inserting the needle into a point on the old man’s wrist. The moment it pierced his skin, he let out a surprised "Huh?"

"This needle... it feels warm?"

Luna smiled faintly and flicked the needle’s tip. To everyone’s shock, it began vibrating with a faint hum.

Every pair of eyes in the room widened. What kind of technique was this?

After three needles, the old man’s complexion visibly brightened. By the time Luna withdrew them, he was already pushing himself upright on the bed.

"Father!" Jiang Zhiguo gasped.

But the real astonishment came when the old man wobbled to his feet—and took a step forward.

"I... I can walk?" Even he couldn’t believe it.

Director Zhang’s face turned ashen, his lips trembling soundlessly.

Luna leisurely packed away her needles and flashed him a sweet smile. "Well, old expert? Convinced now?"
###Chapter 236: The Miraculous Turnaround

"Dr. White, what do you think..." Principal Jiang rubbed his hands together, his face etched with hesitation.

The atmosphere in the hospital room was tense. Dean Xu's expression was grim, and Director Zhang was so furious his mustache trembled. Several specialists stood around the hospital bed, their gazes fixed on the young woman with a ponytail.

Luna White calmly arranged her silver needle case, flicking the tip of a needle with her fingertip, producing a clear, resonant hum.

"Principal Jiang, if you don't trust me, you can stop this right now," she said, lifting her eyes. Her dark, piercing gaze held a hint of amusement. "But with the old man's condition, every day wasted increases the risk."

Director Zhang slammed his hand on the table and stood abruptly. "This is absurd! The old man just woke up—his body is still weak. What could a little girl like you possibly know?"

"Director Zhang!" Jiang Shaoqing suddenly interjected, stepping in front of Luna. "Who was it that said the old man wouldn’t wake up yesterday?"

The retort left Director Zhang red-faced and speechless.

Dean Xu sighed. "Dr. White, this isn’t personal. But the old man’s vitals are unstable. Acupuncture at this stage is too risky."

Luna chuckled softly and retrieved an antique wooden box from her bag. The moment she opened it, a faint medicinal aroma filled the air.

"What is...?" Dean Xu’s pupils contracted.

"My family’s Nine Revival Needles," Luna said, plucking a hair-thin silver needle between her fingers. "The old man’s condition isn’t ordinary—it’s a blockage in his meridians causing severe qi and blood deficiency. It’s no surprise Western medicine couldn’t detect it."

Suddenly, Old Man Jiang on the bed opened his eyes. "Girl, what are the odds of success?"

"One hundred percent."

The room erupted in murmurs.

Director Zhang trembled with rage. "Arrogant! Utterly arrogant!"

Ignoring him, Luna turned to Jiang Shaoqing. "Have someone prepare a cup of hot cocoa—freshly brewed."

Without hesitation, Jiang Shaoqing strode toward the door.

"Wait!" Dean Xu blocked his path. "The old man can’t consume anything right now!"

Luna had already pulled back the old man’s blanket, the silver needle glinting coldly in her fingers. "After three needles, he won’t just drink cocoa—he’ll walk out of this bed."

"Preposterous!" Director Zhang bellowed.

The first needle descended. Old Man Jiang suddenly took a deep breath.

The second needle. The numbers on the monitor began to fluctuate.

When the third needle pierced the acupuncture point, the room fell into stunned silence.

"Help me up," the old man commanded, his voice strong.

Principal Jiang scrambled to assist, only to be pushed aside. To everyone’s shock, the octogenarian sat up on his own and stretched.

"Marvelous!" Old Man Jiang laughed heartily. "Girl, your skills are extraordinary!"

Luna accepted the freshly delivered hot cocoa and took a slow sip. The sweetness melted on her tongue, warmth spreading through her.

"Impossible..." Dean Xu’s hands trembled as he checked the monitor. "All his vitals are back to normal?"

Director Zhang looked ashen, muttering under his breath, "This defies science..."

Jiang Shaoqing stared at Luna with burning intensity. "Dr. White, I’ll personally escort you back tomorrow."

A faint smile curved Luna’s lips. She knew—the Jiang family now owed her a debt they couldn’t ignore.


###Chapter 237: The Journey Home

The midday sun streamed through the glass window as Luna White finished packing her bags. Before long, Jiang Zhiguo and Jiang Shaoqing arrived in haste, their expressions tinged with apology. They informed her that a flight had been arranged for that afternoon.

"Dr. White, our sincerest apologies," Jiang Shaoqing said, handing her an embossed business card. "This is my personal number. Feel free to contact me anytime."

Luna took the card, her fingers brushing against the gilded edges. Its weight was undeniable—a direct line to the future head of the Jiang family. She tucked it away calmly, though her mind churned with thoughts.

The VIP corridor at the airport was eerily quiet. Luna spotted five large gift boxes neatly arranged on a trolley, each tied with an elegant ribbon.

"A small token of appreciation," Jiang Shaoqing explained. "We've arranged for your pickup at the destination. They'll take you straight back to the hospital."

Luna nodded. She understood the significance—these weren't mere payments but gestures of goodwill. For a family like the Jiangs, such connections were invaluable.

As the plane took off, Luna glanced out the window to see Jiang Shaoqing still standing on the tarmac. Dressed in a crisp suit, he looked like a statue bathed in sunlight.

Meanwhile, Jiang Zhiguo was fuming in his office.

"An outstanding candidate from Aeronautical University, snatched away just like that?" He slammed Luna's file onto the desk. "That devil Andrew Smith has some nerve!"

The documents revealed that Luna had originally been admitted to Aeronautical University before Andrew intervened. Jiang Zhiguo stomped his foot in frustration—had she stayed, her potential would have been limitless.

"Uncle, please calm down," his secretary said, offering tea. "Dr. White's acupuncture skills make her exceptional wherever she goes."

Jiang Zhiguo scoffed. "You don't understand. That girl has the Smith family's mess hanging over her. With a stepmother like Helen Turner, do you think she'll have it easy?"

His eyes narrowed as he plotted how to win Luna over. A miracle doctor like her could be a lifesaver in critical moments.

By the time the plane landed, dusk had settled. A van from the Jiang family was already waiting on the tarmac, and an assistant eagerly helped Luna with her luggage.

"Dr. White, these are local specialties prepared for you," the assistant said, gesturing to the five large boxes. "Mr. Jiang insisted they be delivered directly to your dorm."

Luna smiled her thanks. She knew these gifts were more than just courtesy—they were the Jiangs extending an olive branch.

Back in her dorm, after everyone had left, Luna finally collapsed onto the sofa. Two days of travel had left her exhausted, but the gains far outweighed the fatigue.

She ran her fingers over the embossed card, a cold smirk curling her lips. In her past life, Jiang Shaoqing had given up billions in shares to repay a life debt. This time, she had laid her plans early—the mastermind behind her suffering would pay in blood.

The five gift boxes stood silently in the corner, their surfaces glinting faintly in the fading light. Luna didn't rush to open them—some gifts were best saved for the right moment to maximize their impact.

Outside, twilight deepened. Luna watched the last streaks of sunset, her gaze sharpening. The gears of fate had begun to turn, and this time, she wouldn't repeat the same mistakes.
###Chapter 238: Andrew's New Year Gifts

After a good night's sleep in the hospital dormitory, Luna White woke up refreshed and ready for work the next day. With just three days left before her official holiday break, she couldn't help but feel giddy at the thought of going home.

"Oh, there you are, girl!" Dean Zhang beamed the moment he saw her. "Principal Andrew called to express his gratitude. He said the old man has been eating full bowls of rice and is in excellent spirits—all thanks to you."

Luna smiled modestly. "You're too kind, Dean. It's the hospital's follow-up care that made the real difference."

"By the way, I have good news for you," Dean Zhang lowered his voice conspiratorially. "After the New Year, you'll be sent to the medical university for a two-year advanced training program—with full salary! I fought hard for this opportunity, so make sure you don’t waste it."

Luna's eyes lit up, and she immediately gave an exaggerated salute. "Mission accepted!"

"Enough with the theatrics," Dean Zhang chuckled, waving her off. "Go on now, your patients are waiting."

In her office, her assistant Jack had already prepared her favorite white tea. Since becoming Luna's assistant, Jack had grown increasingly meticulous in his work.

After finishing her rounds for the day, Luna immediately called her brother Ethan to check in.

"Got the tickets—lower berth!" Ethan exclaimed excitedly over the phone. "We leave the day after tomorrow in the morning and should be home by evening."

No sooner had she hung up than the phone rang again.

"Hello?" Luna's heartbeat inexplicably quickened.

"Luna..." Andrew Smith's deep, slightly hoarse voice came through the receiver. "Miss me?"

Luna's face flushed instantly. "W-who would miss you?!"

"But I missed you," Andrew chuckled. "I’ll come see you tomorrow night. I’ve brought some local specialties, and... maybe I can try your cooking?"

"In your dreams!" Luna huffed before hanging up, though she couldn’t suppress the smile tugging at her lips.

While packing her luggage, she finally had time to inspect the gifts Andrew had sent. Opening the five large boxes one by one, Luna’s eyes widened in shock.

The topmost manila envelope contained neatly stacked bills—ten thousand dollars in crisp ten-dollar notes, gleaming temptingly under the light.

"This is..." Luna gasped. Though she’d handled large sums in her past life, ten thousand dollars in this era was equivalent to a fortune today!

Upon examining the other boxes, she realized how thorough Andrew had been—two contained clothes and jewelry for her, one held men’s essentials, and the remaining two were clearly intended for her family: watches, down jackets, stationery, liquor... He’d even prepared gifts for her sisters.

"Oh my..." Luna pressed a hand to her forehead. "How am I supposed to take all this home?"

Staring at the mountain of presents, she felt both touched and overwhelmed. Andrew’s New Year gifts were nothing short of extravagant.
###Chapter 239: The Warmhearted Man

The next afternoon, Luna White took time off work early. Carrying a shopping basket, she headed straight to the market, picking out the freshest lamb blood and beef tripe, along with some ribs and steamed buns. Tonight, she planned to cook Andrew Smith a lavish dinner.

As she reached the dormitory entrance, she spotted a familiar figure kneeling outside the neighboring door—Lily Collins' former mother-in-law. The old woman had learned her lesson this time; instead of making a scene, she knelt there stiffly and silently. Luna smirked inwardly. Lily had already left for her hometown with Phoenix that morning to celebrate the New Year. The old woman's efforts were in vain.

"Dr. Collins has gone back to her hometown. You could kneel here till next year, and it wouldn't change a thing," Luna said before moving to shut the door.

The old woman panicked and scrambled to her feet. "Please, miss, have mercy! Just a cup of hot water?"

Luna closed the door without looking back. She'd seen this act too many times before.

In the kitchen, Luna busied herself with chopping vegetables. She sliced the lamb blood thinly, cleaned and blanched the beef tripe. Her movements were swift and practiced, and soon she had all the ingredients ready for the spicy blood stew.

A knock sounded at the door.

Wiping her hands, Luna went to answer it. Andrew stood on the threshold, a large bag in hand, his face flushed from the cold wind.

"Come in, quick!" Luna pulled him inside.

The moment he stepped in, Andrew wrapped his arms around her. Luna pressed her cheek against his chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. Though he still carried the chill from outside, his embrace was so warm she never wanted to leave it.

"Miss me?" he murmured.

Luna nodded, her face heating up. "I did."

"Really?" he teased.

"Really!" She wriggled out of his arms and darted into the kitchen like a startled rabbit. "Dinner's almost ready."

Andrew set down his bag and immediately noticed the five large boxes in the living room—gifts from Charles Turner. His eyes narrowed slightly as he walked to the kitchen doorway.

"How's Mr. Turner doing?" he asked casually.

"He's recovering well," Luna replied without looking up, stirring the sizzling pan.

Andrew stepped closer and took the spatula from her hand. "Let me handle this."

Luna handed him the freshly steamed buns. "Andrew, take these out."

"Call me Andy," he insisted.

"Andy..." she muttered under her breath, shoving the plate into his hands.

Their fingers brushed accidentally, and Andrew suddenly caught her wrist, his thumb tracing slow circles over her pulse point. Luna's face burned crimson.

"The—the oil's going to burn!" she stammered, yanking her hand free.

Andrew chuckled low and carried the plate away. Luna touched her flaming cheeks, her heart pounding so hard it felt ready to leap out of her chest. She was finding it harder and harder to resist this man's charm.

The rich aroma of spicy blood stew mingled with the sweet tang of braised ribs filled the kitchen. Luna took a deep breath and plated the final dish. Tonight was bound to be anything but ordinary.
###Chapter 240: A Wave of Jealousy

The sound of running water filled the kitchen as Luna White washed dishes with her head slightly lowered. Andrew Smith stood beside her, drying the plates and utensils. Neither spoke, the air between them thick with unspoken tension.

"That nickname is too mushy—can we change it?" Luna suddenly broke the silence, her hands still moving steadily.

Andrew took the bowl she handed him, carefully drying it with a towel. "Then call me 'Second Brother.' I am older than you."

"Second Brother!" Luna chirped, her voice bright with youthful charm.

The corner of Andrew’s mouth lifted involuntarily. "Hmm."

"By the way, Ethan already booked the tickets. We’re leaving the day after tomorrow." Luna flicked water droplets from her hands. "Happy New Year in advance."

"I’ll see you off," Andrew said, placing the last dish in the cabinet.

"No need!" Luna turned to leave. "You’re about to go on leave—it’d be awkward to request time off now. With Ethan around, you think I’d get lost?"

Andrew followed her, his gaze landing on the luggage bag resting on the counter. Luna had already opened it with curiosity. "I told you not to buy so much stuff," she said, though her eyes sparkled with delight.

Inside, neatly packed, were wood ear mushrooms, red ginseng, candies, and on top—a camel-colored wool coat. Luna rummaged through, then frowned. "Why is there only one?"

"Of course there’s only one," Andrew’s voice came from behind, laced with unmistakable bitterness. "I’m not as wealthy as some people, buying piles of gifts to win your favor."

Luna spun around, meeting his sullen expression before realization dawned—he’d been jealous this whole time!

Andrew grew uncomfortable under her gaze and turned toward the kitchen.

"Are you mad?" she asked softly.

"No." He averted his face. "I’m going to boil water."

Luna suddenly wrapped her arms around him from behind. Through the thin fabric of his sweater, she could feel the firmness of his waist and the warmth of his skin.

"Are all men this petty?" she teased deliberately.

Andrew tried to pull away, but she only held on tighter. "It’s not pettiness," he sighed. "I just... don’t want you to suffer with me. My family’s well-off, but my own salary is limited—"

Before he could finish, Luna rose onto her toes and kissed him.

The suddenness of it stunned Andrew for a second before he took control, cupping the back of her head to deepen the kiss. Only when Luna pushed him away, flushed, did he finally relent, pressing one last light peck to her lips.

"Second Brother," Luna leaned against his chest, "I’m not immune to material things, but what I want, I’ll earn myself. Those people’s flattery? It’s just because of my medical skills. If you get jealous over every one of them, how are we supposed to live?"

Andrew tightened his arms around her, burying his face in her hair. "I was being unreasonable," he muttered. "It won’t happen again. I’ll work harder—to become someone you can’t leave."

"This coat is for you. Try it on." He released her. "I’ll handle the luggage arrangements and have someone escort you back."

Luna kissed him happily. "You’re the best!" She dashed off to try on the coat.

The tailored design cinched at the waist, accentuating her slender figure. She twirled. "How do I look?"

Andrew stood in the kitchen doorway, pride and adoration in his eyes. "Beautiful."

In that moment, all traces of jealousy melted into something far sweeter.
###Chapter 241: Homecoming

Luna White and Ethan White packed their luggage with practiced efficiency. Andrew Smith had already arranged everything with his contacts at the train station—their large trunks were sent via freight, and even their platform tickets were taken care of.

"Luna, over here!" Andrew called, leading a bespectacled railway worker toward them. "This is my childhood friend, Ding Ke. He works at the railway bureau."

Ding Ke's eyes lit up as he enthusiastically shook Luna's hand. "Mrs. Smith! Andrew's never introduced us to any woman before—you're the first!"

Luna flushed at the unexpected warmth. "Nice to meet you. I might have to trouble you often in the future."

"Don't mention it!" Ding Ke grinned, but before he could say more, Andrew smoothly pulled Luna's hand back.

"That's enough. We should board now," Andrew said calmly.

Ding Ke winked at him and lowered his voice. "You sly dog, Andrew! Keeping this a secret, huh? Just wait—I'm calling the guys right now!" With a wave at Luna, he dashed off.

The train slowly pulled away from the station. Andrew stood on the platform, his intense gaze fixed on Luna through the window. Suddenly, she leaned out and whispered in his ear, "I'll miss you."

His eyes darkened, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. In the end, he only gave her hand a firm squeeze.

"Call me when you arrive," he said.

As the train grew smaller in the distance, Luna watched his tall figure shrink to a mere dot. A smile tugged at her lips without her realizing it.

"Tsk, tsk. Those eyes could melt steel," Ethan teased beside her.

"Ethan!" Luna shot him a glare, her cheeks burning.

By dusk, the train finally reached its destination. On the platform, a young man holding a sign with "Luna White" stamped his feet against the cold.

"Mrs. Smith!" The boy—Xiao Wu—jogged over as soon as he spotted them. "I'm one of Instructor Andrew's students. He sent me to pick you up!"

Luna's heart warmed. She couldn't imagine how long he'd been waiting in this freezing weather.

The Jeep's trunk barely fit all five large suitcases. Xiao Wu chattered nonstop during the drive, singing Andrew's praises as if he were a legend.

"Our instructor is—"

Luna couldn't help but laugh, her heart swelling with sweetness.

Under the ink-black sky, they finally arrived at Six Paths Village. Luna's sister, Luna Whitaker, had already heard the commotion and rushed out in her padded coat.

"You're finally back!" She pulled Luna into a tight hug. "Hungry? I'll make noodles!"

Xiao Wu helped unload the luggage but declined to stay. Luna quickly pressed two packs of cigarettes into his hands. "If you're not going home for the holidays, come eat with us!"

"Really?" His eyes sparkled. "I'll remember that! Everyone in the unit raves about your braised pork!"

After seeing him off, Luna Whitaker had already prepared steaming bowls of noodles. Cradling her bowl, Luna felt an unexpected warmth in the rising steam—this winter, somehow, felt especially cozy.
###Chapter 242: No Room for Indebtedness

After seeing off Ethan, Luna White slammed the courtyard gate shut with a loud thud.

The aroma of cooking wafted from the kitchen, where Luna was busy at the stove. The dough had been kneaded smooth and elastic, while the savory broth bubbled merrily in the pot. As the water boiled, she deftly dropped in the noodles and gave them a quick stir.

"Come inside and warm up!" Luna called out to the yard.

Luna and Ethan had already shed their coats and settled cross-legged on the heated brick bed, its warmth seeping from their toes to the tops of their heads.

Paul Jackson brought over the low table while Aaron carried in the pot of broth. Moments later, Luna entered with two steaming bowls of noodles.

"Eat while it's hot!" she beamed, her eyes crinkling with joy.

Samuel, perched on the edge of the bed, suddenly slid off with a grin. He returned shortly, clutching a bottle of chili oil in one hand and vinegar in the other.

"Auntie, Uncle, these will make it even tastier!"

Ethan laughed heartily. "Good lad, you've got sharp eyes!"

Blushing, Samuel scrambled back onto the bed and squeezed in beside Ethan.

As Luna untied her apron, her gaze fell on the five large boxes on the floor, and she frowned. "Did you two clear out the department store? How much did this cost?"

Luna simply smiled without answering, while Ethan quickly distanced himself. "Sis, Luna bought everything. I just carried the boxes!" He buried his face in his noodles, pretending not to notice his sister's glare.

Luna grew even more anxious. "Luna! I told you not to send money home anymore!" She began counting on her fingers. "We raise chickens for eggs, pigs for meat—we're doing fine. You need every penny in the city for your dowry!"

Luna pointed to the numbered boxes. "Ethan, bring over Box One."

Paul glanced at his mother. Luna sighed in resignation. "Go ahead. It's not like we can return them now."

The three brothers hauled the box over and gasped when they opened it.

"Mom! Look!" Paul held up a radio, his hands trembling.

Aaron brandished a digital watch, while Samuel clutched a new backpack and fountain pen. Their eyes sparkled like stars.

Luna inhaled sharply. "How much did this cost?" She pulled Luna close. "Tell me the truth—did Andrew give you these?"

Luna shook her head.

"Don't lie to me!" Luna smacked the bed in frustration. "Accepting such expensive gifts before marriage? How will you hold your head up in your in-laws' home? We may be poor, but we—"

Before she could finish, Luna threw herself into her arms. "You're the best, Sis!"

"None of that!" Luna pushed her away, cheeks flushed. "These must be returned!"

Reluctantly, the brothers placed the items back in the box.

Luna hurried to explain. "They were gifts from the family I treated. The head of the household, I mean. Ethan can vouch for me!"

Ethan nodded vigorously. "She did treat someone, but I didn't know about the gifts."

Only then did Luna relax slightly. "That family... didn't notice anything, did she?" she whispered, her eyes filled with worry.

Luna squeezed her sister's hand. "Don't worry. Everything's fine."
###Chapter 243: The Warmth of Homecoming

"Go ahead and take them out. They're all custom-made for you," Luna White said with a smile to her three nephews.

The boys immediately turned to their mother, Luna White's elder sister, for approval. In this household, their mother's word was law.

Luna's sister nodded. "Since these are specially made to thank your aunt, you can accept them." Hearing the reason, she didn't refuse. Seeing her younger sister succeed filled her with pride.

As long as Luna was safe and happy, letting the children enjoy this moment was no trouble at all.

The three Jackson brothers—Ethan, Aaron, and Samuel—cheered excitedly.

Luna's eyes crinkled with joy, her dimples peeking through. This was the warmth of family.

Watching the boys gasp with delight at each gift they unwrapped, Luna's sister finally interjected, "What time do you think it is? Your aunt and uncle have been traveling all day—they need rest."

The boys obediently packed up their treasures and ushered their uncle Ethan White toward their shared room. Naturally, Ethan would be bunking with his nephews.

Luna's sister swiftly prepared the bedding and blew out the oil lamp.

Luna slipped under the covers, the heat from the brick bed warming her from below. She stretched contentedly. Even the distant sounds of roosters crowing and dogs barking outside felt comforting.

This was what coming home felt like.

———

Dawn had barely broken when the courtyard buzzed with voices.

"Keep it down—Luna's still asleep!"

"I told you to come later, but you wouldn't listen!"

"Mom, look at all these people waiting to see Luna!"

"Enough already—you talk too much."

Luna stretched lazily and dressed at a leisurely pace.

The moment movement was heard inside, the chatter outside grew louder.

After combing her hair and washing her face, Luna pulled a large bag of candies from her suitcase. Whenever she and her eldest brother returned from the city, they always brought back treats.

The moment she stepped into the courtyard, children swarmed around her. Laughing, Luna handed out candies to each of them. One bold child grabbed an extra handful, and when Luna didn't scold him, he grinned and scampered away.

The villagers were honest folk—no one took advantage of kindness.

Clara Clark and her daughter Lily immediately ushered Luna inside once she appeared. The other women, after accepting their candies and exchanging pleasantries, tactfully dispersed.

"Luna, tell me—why did you suddenly take that job? Such a shame!" Clara clasped her hands, concerned.

Luna handed Lily a digital watch and presented Clara with a box of red ginseng. "Mom, working at the hospital is just like being assigned a job after graduation. The director said they'll send me to medical college this summer—I'll still get my degree."

"Besides," she added playfully, "I'm too petite to fly planes. Being a doctor suits me better."

Clara still looked regretful. "But university—"

"Mom, as a doctor, I can heal people and carry on my parents' acupuncture legacy," Luna reassured her gently.

Clara gasped at the red ginseng. "This must have cost a fortune! You shouldn't have—"

"If you don't take it, I'll be upset!" Luna pouted.

Lily had already fastened the watch around her wrist, admiring it. "Mom, these are so trendy—you can't even find them in town!"

"Twenty-something dollars?" Clara exclaimed. "We can't accept this!"

Luna linked arms with her. "Mom, this is my gift to you. If you refuse, you're saying I'm not your daughter."

Clara chuckled. "Oh, you and your silver tongue... Fine, I'll take it this time. But no more splurging!"

"Yes, Mom!" Luna leaned affectionately against her shoulder.

Lily leaned in, lowering her voice. "Harold Martin got five years in prison—serves him right!"

Luna raised an eyebrow. "Didn't Dad deal with the Martins?"

Lily smirked. "Dad reclaimed their land and cut off their relief funds. When Harold's mom came to make a scene, Uncle Joe took their pig."

"The whole village got pork—except them," Lily added with a wink. "Dad made it clear: no more nonsense will be tolerated."

Luna smiled knowingly. George Clark was clearly drawing out the Martins' punishment.

"And their second son wanted that factory job in town? Dad refused to stamp his paperwork." Lily scoffed. "With a rapist for a brother? Dream on."

Luna could almost picture old Mrs. Martin wallowing in regret now. If only she'd let her son marry Lily properly back then.
###Chapter 244: We're Not Family

The midday sun streamed through the window as Luna White finished smoothing out the bedding. Just then, a shrill wail erupted from the courtyard.

"Oh dear heavens, I can't take this anymore..."

Luna's brow furrowed—she knew that voice all too well. Sure enough, the next second, Clara White barged in, dragging Maya White behind her.

Luna barely recognized them. Maya, once fresh-faced, now looked gaunt and sickly, her right eye bruised, hair tangled like a bird's nest, clothes filthy. Clara reeked of sour sweat, her greasy hair practically dripping oil. The moment they entered, they lunged for the bed, but Luna snatched up a broom to block them.

"Sit over there!" She pointed to the bench in the corner.

Clara froze, then slapped her thigh and wailed, "Luna, your sister's been beaten half to death, and you—"

"Stop right there." Luna sneered. "Who said she's my sister? Didn't your family cut ties with us long ago?"

Her sharp eyes caught the lice crawling in Clara's hair, and she recoiled in disgust. "And keep your fleas and lice away from our home."

At that, Maya immediately let go of Clara's arm and shuffled aside.

Clara stomped her foot in fury and turned to Ethan White, who had just walked in. "Ethan, you have to stand up for your sister! That bastard Frank Harris beat Maya so badly she lost the baby—"

Ethan sidestepped her coldly. "Spare me the act. Wasn’t this 'wonderful marriage' originally meant for Luna? Now that karma’s biting back, you remember us?"

Luna silently cheered for her brother.

"You—you heartless monsters!" Clara jabbed a trembling finger at Ethan.

"Compared to how you schemed against Luna, we’re saints." Ethan barked toward the door, "Ethan! Aaron! Bring the fire poker!"

Two teenage boys rushed in, one brandishing a broom, the other a fire poker, glaring at the mother-daughter pair.

"Get out!" Ethan snapped. "Come back, and we’ll break your legs!"

Clara tried to throw a tantrum, but Ethan Jackson swiped her leg with the broom, making her yelp in pain. Maya, thoroughly humiliated, tugged Clara toward the exit.

The moment they left, Luna ordered, "Boil water! Scald every inch of that bench!"

When Iris White entered with lunch, the house was buzzing with sanitizing efforts. She sighed. "They came again?"

"Ethan chased them off." Luna handed her a pair of chopsticks. "Next time, just drive them out with force."

Ethan took a bite of his steamed bun and mumbled, "Exactly. People like that only understand one language."

Iris smiled as she refilled her brother’s bowl. "Don’t worry. Our family’s doing well now. They can’t touch us."

Her mind drifted to plans for raising more chickens come spring, saving up to build a proper brick house. The thought made her chuckle.
###Chapter 245: Coercion and Persuasion

Maya White and Clara White returned to the White family courtyard, cursing under their breath the entire way.

The moment they stepped over the threshold, they nearly collided with Ethan White, who was slouching through the gate with his head down.

The sight of Maya made Ethan's temper flare instantly. "What are you doing back here again? Running home every single day—no wonder Frank Harris can't stand you! Serves you right that he beats you!"

Maya exploded. "Ethan! Are you even my real brother? Instead of helping me after I got beaten, you're just rubbing salt in the wound!"

Clara bristled. "Ethan! How can you talk like that? Look at what your sister's been through! Tomorrow, you and Jack are going to confront Frank and make him pay!"

Ethan scoffed. "Mom, don't count on me. Look at the state of this family. I can't even afford a wife, and you want to bring Maya back? Who's going to feed her?"

He jabbed a finger at Maya. "If you hadn't stolen the family's money and squandered it, I wouldn't still be single! Lisa Wilson's family said if I don't send the betrothal gifts by spring, they'll marry her off to someone else!"

Clara snatched up a broom and swung at Ethan. "You ungrateful brat! How dare you talk back to me! If it weren't for your grandmother's meddling, would I be in this state?"

Ethan dodged, shouting, "Whose fault is that? You're the one who treated Grandma like dirt! Now she's hoarding all the money from the harvest, and I don't have a penny for my wedding!"

The thought made him seethe. He should've been married right after the autumn harvest, but now everything was ruined—all because of his mother and his troublemaker sister.

"Beat me all you want, I'm not going!" Ethan squared his shoulders. "Frank was her choice! A married daughter is like spilled water—none of my business!"

Maya trembled with rage. She'd thought Jack would stand up for her when he returned, but even her own brother was turning his back on her.

"Ethan!" She suddenly dropped to her knees. "Frank is a monster! He gambles all day and sleeps with that widow. The Harris family only survives on his uncle's charity, and now even he's cut them off!"

She rolled up her sleeves, revealing dark bruises. "I cook and clean for five people, then work the fields all day. Frank beats me for no reason—he even made me lose the baby!"

Tears streamed down her face. "If you won't help me, I'll go back and hang myself! Let the whole village see how the Whites drove their own daughter to her death!"

Ethan paled. If Maya really killed herself, his wedding would be called off for sure.

"No, no, don't!" He hurried to pull her up. "I'll go see Frank tomorrow! I'll make sure he answers for this!"

Maya wiped her tears, a glint of steel flashing in her eyes. This time, she'd make sure Frank Harris learned she wasn't someone to be trifled with.
###Chapter 246: The Pig Sale Controversy

At the break of dawn, Luna White was awakened by rustling noises in the yard. Rubbing her eyes, she saw her eldest sister, Luna Whitaker, already bustling around the stove.

"Sis, why so early?" Luna asked, pulling on her coat as she stepped outside.

Luna Whitaker wiped the sweat from her brow. "We're selling the pigs today. Need to get ready early." She tossed more firewood into the stove. "Didn't feed them last night, so I'm giving them some water this morning."

Ethan White returned from the backyard, his pants still flecked with grass. "All four pigs are lively. Each must weigh at least three hundred pounds."

The three children were up too. Ethan Jackson rubbed his hands excitedly. "Mom, can we pay for Sam's tuition after selling the pigs?"

Luna Whitaker smiled and nodded. "Not just tuition—we'll get you all new clothes too."

Just then, footsteps sounded outside the gate. Ryan Wallace entered with a short, stocky man in tow.

"Ethan, this is Mr. Sun," Ryan introduced. "He's here to buy pigs."

Ethan quickly offered a cigarette. Sun took it, but his eyes kept drifting toward Luna Whitaker.

"Heard you're quite the pig farmer, Miss Whitaker?" Sun exhaled smoke rings.

Luna Whitaker smiled shyly. "Learned it all from Ryan."

The group headed to the backyard pigpen. Sun's eyes lit up at the sight of the four plump, healthy pigs. "Wow, these are well-raised!"

He sidled up to the pen, then suddenly reached out and pinched Luna Whitaker's arm. "You're quite the capable woman!"

Luna Whitaker stiffened, stepping back half a pace. Ethan instantly moved between them. "Mr. Sun, keep your hands to yourself while inspecting the pigs."

Sun chuckled awkwardly, withdrawing his hand. "Just got carried away. These pigs are impressive."

Ryan stood nearby, his fists clenched tight.

"Alright," Sun pulled out a calculator. "I'll take all four at ninety cents per pound."

Luna Whitaker was about to agree when Ryan suddenly spoke up. "Wait. I'll pay ninety-five."

Sun's face darkened. "Ryan, that's not how we do business."

"Highest bidder wins—isn't that what you taught me?" Ryan smirked.

Luna sensed the tension and subtly tugged Ethan's sleeve.

"Fine! Ninety-five it is!" Sun gritted his teeth.

"A dollar," Ryan said calmly.

Sun's face turned livid. "Ryan! Are you trying to screw me over?"

"Mr. Sun," Ethan interjected smoothly, "how about we sell two today and save the rest for later?"

Sun shot Ryan a glare, spat out "Ungrateful wretch," and stormed off.

The yard fell silent. Luna Whitaker wrung her hands anxiously. "What do we do now...?"

"Don't worry," Ryan said suddenly. "I'll take them. At a dollar twenty."

Luna's eyes widened in surprise. Ethan studied Ryan thoughtfully.

"That's... too generous," Luna Whitaker stammered.

Ryan's gaze softened. "Consider it a New Year's gift for the kids."

A small smile curved Luna's lips. It seemed today's sale wasn't just about pigs after all...
###Chapter 247: Hidden Intentions

Ethan White's gaze never left Luna Whitaker the entire journey, his mouth running nonstop with praise. "Luna, you're not just lovely—you're also incredibly capable." The fervor in his eyes was so obvious even the stray dogs by the roadside could guess his intentions.

Ryan Wallace stood nearby, his expression growing darker by the minute.

Luna, Ethan, and Iris were busy excitedly calculating their earnings. The four pigs they had raised weighed at least 1,100 pounds combined. At ninety cents per pound, they’d make over a thousand dollars!

"A thousand dollars!" Luna's fingers trembled with excitement.

Adding the income from selling eggs, they could save over two thousand dollars in a year. Even after spending half on food, they’d still have more than a thousand left—a fortune in their village.

Iris watched her sister’s joy but bit back her concerns. The pigs had thrived only because of Luna’s supernatural ability. If anything went wrong, they could lose everything. But today wasn’t the day for such warnings.

That afternoon, Ethan arrived with a truck. Workers swiftly tied up the pigs and weighed them—1,140 pounds in total.

"Boss, these pigs are solid. No tricks here," the veteran inspector reported.

Ethan’s admiration for Luna grew. She was honest—just what you’d expect from a military family.

"Luna, here’s $1,026. Count it," he said, pulling out a thick stack of bills.

Luna smiled and handed the money to Iris. "Little sister, check it for me."

Iris carefully counted. "It’s correct, sis."

Before leaving, Ethan made a point to tell Luna, "I left my number. Call me anytime you need help." His enthusiasm left no doubt about his feelings.

After seeing him off, Luna locked the courtyard gate. With so much cash at home, she wouldn’t have felt safe without her brother around.

Iris sidled up to tease her. "Sis, that Mr. Ethan was looking at you a little too warmly!"

Luna shot her a warning glance. "Businessmen are like that with everyone. Don’t read too much into it." Her heart already belonged to someone else—the thought of Ryan made her lips curl into a secret smile.

Iris’s curiosity flared. Her sister was definitely hiding something! She’d get the truth out of her tonight. This time, she’d make sure Luna didn’t end up with another scoundrel like Paul Jackson.

At dinner, Ethan returned from the village council with news: their sister Iris would be home by the 29th of December. As the family happily planned for the New Year, Luna suddenly gasped. "Oh no! I sold all the pork we were saving for the holidays!"

Iris laughed. "It’s fine, sis. We’ll buy some from the village. But we should clean out the west room—Iris’s family of five will need space."

Luna groaned. "How could I forget? I’ll find a carpenter tomorrow, though I’m not sure if they’ll take jobs this late."

Ethan set down his chopsticks. "I’ll talk to the mayor. With extra pay, we can get it done in a day. I still have my stipend—I’d be happy to help."

The thought of finally celebrating the New Year as a full family warmed his heart. No more lonely holidays—this year, their home would be filled with laughter.
###Chapter 248: Home Repairs

At the break of dawn, Ethan White made his way to George Clark's house, carrying a pack of premium cigarettes and two bottles of fine liquor that gleamed in the morning light. His sister Luna had prepared them as New Year's gifts for her godfather.

George sat on the heated brick bed, puffing on his pipe while his two sons, Liam and Owen, flanked him. When Ethan entered, the brothers immediately stood to greet him.

"Ethan! You're here early!" Owen said warmly.

George squinted with a smile. "You sure didn't waste any time."

Ethan set the gifts on the table. "Uncle, these are from Luna."

George waved his hands in protest. "This is too much! She already brought over plenty yesterday—"

"If you refuse, she'll say I don't know how to behave," Ethan cut in with a chuckle. "Besides, these were gifts from her patients. She insisted you have them."

Liam clapped Ethan on the shoulder. "Come on, Ethan. No need for formalities between our families. If it weren't for Luna, who knows what would've happened to my sister."

The three settled on the bed, and Ethan passed around cigarettes. Amid the curling smoke, he broached the real reason for his visit.

"Uncle, I was thinking of fixing up the old house..."

George slapped his thigh. "Leave it to me! Liam and Owen trained as carpenters—they'll handle the doors and windows. I'll get some experienced hands to patch up the roof. We'll have it done in a day."

True to his word, George immediately set off to gather help, while the brothers followed Ethan home to take measurements.

The yard soon buzzed with activity. Villagers carried straw and buckets of mortar in and out. Ethan and the Clark brothers handed out cigarettes and water as the clatter of roof tiles echoed above.

By evening, new doors and windows were installed, and the roof had been completely repaired. Ethan Jackson, Luna's eldest nephew, brought firewood to heat the brick bed.

"Finally livable again," Ethan said, wiping sweat from his brow.

Just then, hurried footsteps approached. A villager rushed in, panting. "Mayor! Trouble—the Whites' place is in chaos!"

George frowned. "What now?"

"Ethan and Owen were beaten! They went to the Harris place for answers, but—"

Ethan's heart skipped. It seemed Maya's ordeal wasn't over yet.

At the Whites' home, Ethan cradled his broken arm, howling in pain, while Owen's leg bent at an unnatural angle. Jack White paced anxiously inside, and Clara wailed curses at the Harris family.

"The mayor's here!" someone shouted.

George strode into the yard, his expression grim, followed by several village officials. He examined the injured men, his frown deepening.

"What happened?"

Jack grabbed George's arm. "George, you have to stand up for us! Those Harris bastards—"

It turned out Ethan and Owen had gone to confront the Harris family that morning, only to find loan sharks demanding repayment. Frank Harris had already fled, leaving the enraged debt collectors to take their anger out on the White brothers.

"They even took Maya's dowry!" Clara wailed, pounding her chest.

George sighed. "Get them to the clinic first. This... will take careful handling."

As night fell, Ethan stood in front of his newly repaired house, gazing toward the Whites' home in the distance. He knew this storm was only beginning.


###Chapter 249: Debt Collectors at the Door

"Ouch... It hurts so much..."

"Mom... Is my leg useless now..."

The groans of Ethan White and Harold White rose and fell in turns, while Clara White stomped her feet in distress. The sight of her two sons being carried home, covered in blood, had nearly made her faint.

"That Frank Harris is absolutely despicable!" Maya White clenched the hem of her dress, her nails digging into her palms. She never imagined Frank would dare to hurt her brothers so badly.

The village's rural physician had just set their bones and was wrapping splints around their injuries. "One has a broken arm, the other a broken leg. They'll need at least three months to recover properly. If complications arise, they might end up disabled."

Clara trembled with rage and immediately shouted for someone to fetch the mayor. With Ethan out of the picture, the only hope for justice now lay with Mayor George Clark.

George walked into the yard with his hands behind his back. After hearing the full story, he shook his head. "I can't interfere with loan shark business. Just focus on healing."

"Mayor!" Clara shoved Jack White forward in desperation. "Look at these injuries!"

Jack stepped forward reluctantly. "Mayor, if this goes unpunished, won't outsiders think they can bully our village freely? The White family's humiliation is one thing, but Six Paths Village's reputation is at stake!"

George scoffed. "Jack, you sure know how to spin words. But this mess was caused by your son-in-law. Why should we step in? If you ask me, you should take this up with your in-laws."

The gathered villagers chimed in:
"Exactly! Who dares mess with loan sharks?"
"Frank's family should pay for the medical bills!"
"Your daughter's still here—Frank's family will come for her sooner or later..."

With that, George and the crowd dispersed, leaving the yard eerily quiet. Clara was so furious she nearly passed out, while her sons' pained moans from the bed tore at her heart.

"Husband, are we just going to let this go?" Clara moved closer to Jack, but he recoiled in disgust.

Standing upwind, Jack frowned. "What else can we do? Loan sharks aren't to be trifled with. Blame your daughter—running home after a few slaps, and now her brothers are bedridden!"

In his eyes, a man disciplining his wife was natural. Maya's tantrum had thrown the household into chaos and gotten his sons injured. With the New Year approaching, how were they supposed to celebrate with two invalids at home?

Clara deflated. If her husband wouldn't act, what could she, a mere woman, do?

"So... we just accept it?"

"Why rush?" Jack narrowed his eyes. "Frank's family will come for her eventually. When they do, we'll demand compensation for medical expenses and recovery costs—not a penny less!"

He had already calculated everything. The old woman was hoarding the family's money, and Harold's wedding dowry was still short. This was the perfect opportunity to squeeze some funds out of the Harris family.

Outside the window, Maya bit her lip until it bled. Her father's words cut deeper than any knife. There was no hope left in her family—she had to start planning for herself...
###Chapter 250: Moonlit Rendezvous

Luna and Ethan barely batted an eye when they heard about Jack White's family drama. That household could stir up whatever trouble they wanted—it had nothing to do with them. The siblings had long decided they would never acknowledge Jack again.

Still, Ethan had to visit their grandmother that evening. She was family, after all, and neither he nor Luna Whitaker could ignore that obligation. But Luna refused to go. She and the old woman had never gotten along, and showing up would only make things worse.

"I'll just check on Grandma and come right back," Ethan said, carrying two cans of luncheon meat, a box of pastries, and a roast duck out the door. These were rare treats in the village, and their grandmother had few pleasures left beyond food.

Luna sat cross-legged on the kang, sketching with a pencil on paper. Tomorrow was market day in town, and she needed to list everything they had to buy. The house was missing so much—bedding, cookware, basic groceries… She sighed as she wrote. Her eldest sister had been scraping by for too long.

Just then, Luna Whitaker changed into a blue-checked blouse and hurried toward the door. "Luna, I'm going for a walk. I'll be back soon."

Luna's nose twitched at the scent of face cream. Suspicious, she looked up. "Where are you going this late? Want me to come?"

"No, no!" Luna Whitaker waved her hands. "I just ate too much and need to walk it off." With that, she stepped out quickly.

Luna's eyes narrowed. She jumped off the kang, threw on her down jacket, grabbed a flashlight, and followed. Under the moonlight, her sister's bobbing flashlight beam headed toward the village outskirts.

Luna kept her own light off, trailing silently. Her heart pounded—who was her sister meeting at this hour, all dressed up?

The answer came soon enough. A tall figure stood waiting at the village dam, stepping forward the moment he spotted Luna Whitaker.

"Luna!" He pulled her into an embrace. "Walking this dark path alone—what if you'd fallen?"

Hiding behind a tree, Luna nearly gasped. It was Ryan Wallace! She'd sensed something between them earlier, but this was outright scandalous!

"I was afraid Ethan or Luna might see us," Luna Whitaker whispered, her voice trembling. "Maybe… we should end this."

"Nonsense!" Ryan's voice rose sharply. "I've made up my mind. Even if my father disowns me, I'm marrying you!"

"But—"

"No buts!" He gripped her hands tightly. "The way that Sun Weimin looked at you today—I wanted to claw his eyes out!"

Luna Whitaker giggled. "Don't be silly. If I wanted him, would I be sneaking out to see you?"

Under the moonlight, they held each other close. Hidden in the shadows, Luna felt a storm of emotions. So her sister had been hiding this to avoid village gossip…

"Ryan, I'm scared…"

"Don't be. I'm here." His voice was firm. "Worst case, we leave this place. Luna Whitaker, I swear I'll marry no one but you."

Luna retreated quietly, then turned back toward home. The night wind brushed her face, and suddenly her eyes burned. In this world, even true love had to hide in the shadows.
###Chapter 251: The Siren

Luna White was about to step forward and lay everything bare, if only to spare her sister the constant anxiety.

But she was a second too late.

"Ryan!"
"Son!"

Two furious voices exploded simultaneously. Luna looked up to see two figures charging out from the woods near the dam.

She rubbed her temples and covered her face in resignation.

Well, this was just perfect. Caught red-handed.

"Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?" Ryan Wallace instinctively shielded Luna Whitaker behind him.

"Ryan, get your ass home right now!" Old Man Walter Wallace bellowed.

"Dad—"

"If you don't leave this instant, I'll break your legs!" Walter trembled with rage. "I'll disown you!"

Luna, still hidden, clicked her tongue.

This was about to get messy.

"Dad, since you've seen it all, I won't lie." Ryan straightened his back. "I love Luna. I want to marry her."

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed as Walter's palm struck Ryan's face.

Luna winced. That slap held nothing back—Walter was truly unhinged.

"Ryan, don't provoke your father! Come home with me!" Mrs. Eleanor Wallace hurried forward to pull her son away.

Ryan yanked his arm free. "Dad, you can beat me to death today, but I'm still marrying Luna!" His jaw set, unmovable.

Father and son stood locked in a standoff.

Luna Whitaker gently tugged Ryan's sleeve. "You should go back with your parents first..."

"Shut your mouth!" Walter suddenly roared. "You divorced woman, luring my son out in the dead of night! No wonder the Jacksons threw you out—you're nothing but a siren!"

Luna Whitaker's tears fell instantly.

"Dad!" Ryan pulled her into his arms. "I pursued her! If you want to curse someone, curse me!"

Walter heaved ragged breaths, his eyes bloodshot.

"Mark my words—as long as I live, this siren will never set foot in the Wallace household!"

"Walter!" Eleanor intervened. "Let's discuss this at home!"

She turned to Luna Whitaker. "You should go. We... need to think things through."

Luna Whitaker gently pushed Ryan away. "Go home." Her voice was barely audible.

The moment she turned, her tears finally broke free.

She ran as if fleeing a monster, her steps unsteady.

Luna followed silently, her heart wrenching at the sight of her sister's stumbling figure.

Her sister—always so kind, always so heartbreaking.

This storm was only just beginning.
###Chapter 252: Catharsis

Luna Whitaker burst into the house, her vision blurred by tears. She slammed the door shut and slid down against it, her back pressed to the wooden surface. For the first time in over twenty years, she allowed herself to appear this disheveled.

Her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt no pain. She remembered Ryan Wallace's words when he first held her hand: "Luna, you deserve the best in this world." Now, all she tasted was bitterness.

"Big sis?" Luna's younger sister, Iris, called from outside the door.

Luna hastily wiped her face, only to find her cheeks drenched. She hadn't realized she'd been crying so hard.

"I'm fine," she forced out, her voice hoarse and broken.

The door creaked open. Iris stepped in with a cup of hot tea, pausing when she saw her sister's red-rimmed eyes.

"You saw everything?" Luna gave a bitter smile.

Iris set the tea down and crouched beside her. "Saw what? That my sister was bullied into hiding and crying in her room?"

The words broke the dam. Luna covered her face, her composure crumbling. "They called me shameless... said I was seducing men right after my divorce... Iris, am I really that despicable?"

"Bullshit!" Iris yanked Luna's hands away. "Who said that? I'll tear their mouths apart!"

Luna shook her head, tears splattering on the floor. "The whole village is saying it... Ryan's mother publicly called me a homewrecker today..."

"So what?" Iris shot to her feet. "Are you going to give up your happiness because of some gossiping busybodies?"

Luna froze. She looked up at her sister's flushed, furious face and suddenly remembered the rainy night when Ryan had waited for her outside the factory, an umbrella in hand, his eyes shining just like this.

"But—"

"No buts!" Iris knelt and gripped her hands tightly. "Big sis, you divorced to live like a human being, not to become someone else's punching bag!"

Luna's hands trembled. She recalled her ex-husband's drunken fists, her mother-in-law's cruel words, and then Ryan's gentle fingers as he carefully applied ointment to her wounds.

"I'm afraid of dragging you and the kids into this..."

"Afraid of what?" Iris scoffed. "Since when have the women of our family ever feared idle gossip?"

A loud thud came from outside. Iris yanked open the curtains to see Ryan standing in the yard, a half-empty sack of flour at his feet.

"I... I brought this..." he stammered, his ears burning red. "L-Luna, my mother's words don't count! I'm marrying you, no matter what!"

Luna burst into laughter, though her tears fell harder. Seeing Iris's teasing grin, she suddenly felt lighter than she had in years.

"Hear that?" Iris poked her forehead. "Someone's waiting to marry you, and here you are wallowing in self-pity."

Luna wiped her tears, took a deep breath, and stood. She smoothed her clothes and lifted her chin as she strode toward the door.

"Sis?"

"I'm going to have a little chat with Ryan's mother," Luna said, turning back with a smile, her eyes still wet but blazing with determination. "Can't let her insults go unanswered, can I?"

Iris stared for a second before bursting into laughter. She hurried to loop her arm through Luna's. "Let's go. I'm with you!"

Outside, Ryan fidgeted nervously. When he saw the sisters approaching, his face lit up, though his hands still twisted anxiously. "Uh... my mother, she—"

"Lead the way," Luna cut in, tilting her chin up. "I'm going to have a proper talk with her."

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground. Iris watched her sister's straight-backed figure and suddenly saw the same big sister who'd once fought off village boys to protect her.

This was catharsis. This was how life should be lived.
###Chapter 253: Cast Out

The night deepened as the two sisters lay on the heated brick bed. Luna turned over suddenly and asked, "Sis, when did things start between you and Ryan?" Her voice carried a teasing lilt in the darkness.

Luna stiffened, her fingers unconsciously twisting the quilt's edge. "H-how did you notice?"

"Notice?" Luna chuckled softly. "The way you two keep avoiding each other's eyes—even Ethan noticed, and that boy's clueless."

A frustrated sigh escaped from under the covers. "It's only been... a month. I thought after the divorce, I'd just raise the kids alone. But then..." Her voice trailed off.

"Sis, do you love him?" Luna asked bluntly.

Silence. Love was a foreign concept to Luna. Her marriage to Darren had been arranged, and the divorce had been forced upon her. Love? She'd never dared consider it.

"Being with him... I feel safe," Luna finally admitted. "When he smiles, I want to smile too. No matter how hard the work is, if he's beside me, it doesn't feel so bad."

Luna squeezed her sister's hand in the dark. "That's love, you silly goose."

"But..." Luna's voice cracked. "A woman like me, with three kids..."

"Sis!" Luna cut her off. "If you ever want to leave the village, you and the boys can come to me. The city has opportunities now—you and Ryan could open a small shop. It'd be better than farming."

Luna didn't reply. She'd considered leaving, but the boys needed school, and she had no education...

"Sleep, sis. We have the market tomorrow." Luna gave her sister's shoulder a gentle pat.

That night, Luna tossed and turned, unable to rest. At dawn's first light, she rose to sweep the courtyard. But when she opened the door, she froze.

A basin clattered to the ground.

Luna rushed out to find her sister supporting Ryan, who was covered in snow. His face was deathly pale, and he clutched a tattered bedroll.

"Get him inside!" Luna hurried to help. The commotion brought Ethan and Ethan running, and together they hauled Ryan into the house.

"Uncle Ryan, what happened?" Ethan fretted, rubbing his hands anxiously.

Ryan's lips were blue from cold, but he forced himself upright. "Ethan, Luna... I came to ask you something." He took a deep breath. "I want to marry your sister."

The room fell silent.

"I had a fight with my family last night," Ryan said bitterly. "My father said if I don't give up this idea, I'll never inherit the family carpentry business." He patted the bedroll beside him. "Now I've got nothing."

Ethan gaped, speechless. He looked from his sister to Ryan, his mind reeling.

Luna stood in the corner, biting her lip hard, tears welling in her eyes.
###Chapter 254: New Year Shopping Spree

"Ryan, please sit." Luna gently tugged at Ryan Wallace's sleeve. "This is a private matter between you and my sister. As her siblings, we'll respect whatever makes her happy. Our only condition is—she must be happy!"

The forty-something man's eyes grew misty. He wasn't some impulsive youth—his devotion to Luna White at this age even earned Ethan's silent admiration.

Luna bit her lip, her voice trembling. "Ryan... why would you...? A divorced woman like me isn't worth—"

"When I say I'll marry you, I mean it!" Ryan seized her hands. "Even without my family's pig-farming skills, I can provide for you and the boys!"

Seeing this, Luna quickly pulled Ethan toward the door. "Let's go shopping for New Year supplies! Luna can watch the house." She herded the curious boys outside by their collars.

"Wait, sis!" Ethan stumbled after her. "What's going on? Since when did—"

"Ethan!" Luna set the dishes on the low table with a clatter. "Didn't you see Ethan and the boys grinning ear to ear?"

Young Ethan Jackson flushed and mumbled, "We... we've wanted Uncle Ryan as our dad for ages..."

Luna burst out laughing. "See? If Ryan treats her right, this is perfect!" She deftly arranged the meal. "Our sister's suffered half her life. She deserves happiness."

After dinner, the five set off for town with bamboo baskets. The December market buzzed with crowds and vendors' cries. Luna spotted the beef stall instantly.

"Thirty pounds, please!"

The beaming butcher threw in free tripe. As Luna moved toward the pork stall, Ethan opened his mouth to protest—

"Twenty pounds belly pork! Ten pounds shoulder! And eight pounds minced!"

The teenagers' baskets filled rapidly with New Year treats. Luna darted through the market like a sparrow.

"Five pounds each of kelp and tofu skin!"
"Extra firecrackers!"
"Ten pounds of nuts and candy!"

Ethan hugged their firecrackers, eyes shining. Six months ago they'd been eating cornbread at the quarry—now they could celebrate properly. He pinched himself. Ouch. Real.

Seeing the boys' joy, Luna's throat tightened. She waved grandly. "Two roast chickens! Feast tonight!"

Amid the bustling market, their arms laden with parcels, five faces glowed with happiness. This would be the Whitakers' liveliest New Year yet.

###Chapter 255: The Mystery of William's Disappearance
The five of them made quite a spectacle as they marched into Iris White's home, drawing curious glances from neighbors along the row of single-story houses. Their woven baskets were piled high with goods—clearly, this was no ordinary visit. Iris was kneading dough in the kitchen when the knock came, assuming it was her children home early from school.

"Who is it?" She wiped flour from her hands.

"It's us, Second Sister!" Luna White pushed the door open, followed by four strapping young men.

The rolling pin nearly slipped from Iris' grip. "What brings you all here? Is something wrong?" Her eyes darted to the wall clock—barely past eleven.

"I'm exhausted!" Luna dropped her basket and waved the boys over. "Help me with these, Second Sister. Henry and the others carried them the whole way."

Iris hurried to assist. Five baskets lined up inside, brimming with goods, made her click her tongue. "So much shopping? Were you trying to clear out the whole market?"

"The New Year's coming," Luna said with a grin, rubbing her sore shoulders. "We're here for a meal, Second Sister. Four hungry lads—hope your heart can take it."

Iris pretended to swat at her. "Always full of mischief." Then, lowering her voice, she asked, "By the way, have you seen William?"

"William?" Luna froze. "Isn't he at home?"

Iris' face paled. "He left for the city three months ago with your address. Said he was going to earn money for your dowry."

The air in the kitchen turned thick. Luna's chest tightened. "I never saw him."

The mixing bowl clattered onto the stove as Iris added two more cups of flour. Her hands trembled. "That boy... Could something have happened?"

"Maybe... he couldn't find work and was too embarrassed to reach out?" Luna offered the weak comfort, though unease coiled in her gut.

Iris forced herself back to kneading, but her movements slowed. Luna noticed two extra eggs cracked into the dough—a luxury reserved for honored guests.

When the children returned from school, the house was already rich with the scent of braised meat. Henry Cooper bounded inside, grinning. "What's the occasion?"

The dinner table buzzed with laughter, William's name carefully avoided. Only Luna noticed—Iris filled every bowl to the brim, yet forgot to serve herself.

Meanwhile, in a dim basement miles away, William Cooper huddled in a corner, the faint clink of chains around his wrists. Staring at the narrow vent above, his cracked lips whispered a name: "Luna..."
###Chapter 256: The Sunless Mine

William's hands were pale from soaking in the icy water. The cracks from his frostbite oozed blood, mingling with the muddy water from the potato peels, staining the basin a murky red.

"Hurry up! Finish this basket before noon!" Old Hu urged in a hushed voice, his eyes darting nervously toward the door.

William clenched his jaw and sped up. Today was the mine owner's son's wedding, so the laborers were given sprouted potatoes—a rare treat compared to the usual rock-hard cornbread and pickled vegetables.

A sharp hiss escaped his lips as the peeling knife sliced into his frostbitten skin. Blood welled up instantly. He quickly hid his hand beneath his apron, terrified of being seen by the overseer. Last month, a worker had been beaten to death and thrown into a废弃矿井 for slowing down due to an injured hand.

The kitchen door suddenly flew open with a kick. William flinched, nearly knocking over the potato basin.

"It's just Hank!" Old Hu sighed in relief, scrambling to greet him with fawning deference.

Hank "Tiger" Han swaggered in, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his leather jacket splattered with dried blood. He glanced at William's ghostly pale hands before tossing half a tube of ointment from his pocket. "Use this. Don't get blood in the food."

William bowed his head in thanks, his nails digging into his palms. This was the same beast who had lured him into that van with promises of high-paying work, only to sell him into this hellish black-market mine.

"We've got VIP guests today," Hank exhaled a smoke ring. "Go unload the groceries from the car."

William followed him into the courtyard. Three SUVs were parked outside, and several heavily made-up women were touching up their makeup in the rearview mirrors. When they spotted him, they burst into exaggerated giggles.

"Oh my, what a pretty boy!"
"Hey there, handsome, come have a drink with me tonight~"

William kept his head down and quickened his pace, but a woman in a red dress blocked his path. Her crimson-lacquered nails grazed his chin. "Playing hard to get? I'll pay you—"

"Get off!" William shoved her away violently. The woman shrieked as she stumbled back, her high heels slipping on a stray vegetable leaf and sending her crashing to the ground.

Hank roared with laughter and clapped William on the shoulder. "Feisty! Reminds me of my younger days." He leaned in close, his breath reeking of alcohol and tobacco. "But... don't forget who's keeping you alive."

William's clenched fists slowly relaxed. He bent to help the woman up, but she slapped his hand away.

"Stop pretending to be noble!" she spat as she scrambled to her feet, then suddenly lowered her voice. "Three a.m. tomorrow. The abandoned shaft." With a final glare, she strutted off, swaying her hips.

William froze. He recognized that voice—it was the female journalist who had been brought in last month. She had pretended to be Hank's mistress, but he never thought she'd still be alive...

"Daydreaming?" Hank kicked him. "Move those crates, now!"

William mechanically lifted the vegetable crate. Sweat and blood dripped from his fingertips, blooming into dark red flowers on the ground.
###Chapter 257: Help Me

"Lily, you're not actually falling for that penniless boy, are you?" Red exhaled a smoke ring, eyeing her skeptically. "In our line of work, developing real feelings is the worst mistake you can make. Remember what happened to Lucy? That man swindled her out of everything—money, dignity. She's still bedridden in the hospital."

Lily twirled a tube of lipstick between her fingers and scoffed. "Relax, Red. I just helped him because he reminded me of my brother." She reapplied her makeup in the mirror, her voice turning icy. "My mother's medical bills won't pay themselves. I don't have time for distractions."

"Good girl." Red patted her shoulder approvingly. "That coal tycoon tonight is loaded. Keep him happy, and those bills will vanish with a snap of his fingers."

They stepped into the glittering two-story villa—a den of debauchery where money burned like paper.

"I need to freshen up." Lily gestured toward the restroom.

The bathroom reeked of cheap perfume. Locking the door, Lily pulled a crumpled ten-dollar bill from her bra.

"Ten bucks?" She smirked. "Did that idiot really think this would—"

Her words died as she spotted four tiny pencil marks on the back: Call the police. Help me.

Her hand trembled violently.

In the kitchen, William deftly sliced braised beef. Old Hu fried peanuts beside him, the oil sizzling.

"Open up," William muttered, slipping a piece of meat to Old Hu when the overseer wasn't looking.

Old Hu chewed discreetly, gratitude flickering in his clouded eyes. In this hellhole, survival was measured day by day.

William's gaze drifted to the window. That girl Lily—she must have seen the message by now.

"Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!" The overseer, Monkey, kicked the stove, though his leer remained fixed on the gyrating figures in the villa across the way.

Late that night, the drunken tycoons staggered upstairs with their companions. William crouched by the kitchen's back door, staring at the starry sky.

He refused to die here. Dr. White had saved his life—not for him to rot as a slave. He still owed his brother and sister-in-law everything. He had to escape.

Back in her rented room, Lily studied the bill under the dim light.

"Call the police. Help me..." Her whisper hung in the air as the young man's pale face flashed in her mind.

She knew exactly how powerful these coal tycoons were. Meddling meant suicide.

With a sharp inhale, she shoved the bill into her bottom drawer.

(To be continued...)
###Chapter 258: Destiny's Reunion

The three o'clock bus was the last one back to the village. Luna White checked her watch—if she didn’t leave now, she’d have to walk home with her four younger brothers.

Iris stubbornly shoved the New Year’s gifts from the factory into Luna’s woven basket, but Luna refused to take the slab of pork. The longing in her three nephews’ eyes as they stared at the meat made her heart ache.

"Keep it for the kids, Sis," Luna said, placing the pork back on the table before pulling Ethan and her brothers toward the door.

The bus station buzzed with noise. Suddenly remembering something, Luna turned to Ethan. "Wait for me at the station. I’ll be right back."

She hurried down a familiar street. In her past life, Frank and Mabel Harris had shown her kindness, and she’d often wondered how they were doing in this one.

But when she reached the corner, the little grocery store she remembered was gone—replaced by a noodle shop. Her chest tightened. Had fate’s wheel turned the same way after all?

"Girl!"

A delighted cry rang out behind her. Luna turned to see Aunt Mabel jogging toward her, breathless.

"Finally caught you!" Mabel grabbed her hand. "I’ve been coming to this station every day for months, hoping to run into you."

Luna glanced at her watch—there was still over an hour before the bus left. Mabel tugged her along without waiting for a reply. "Come home with me. Your uncle will be thrilled to see you."

Two streets later, a brand-new two-story building came into view beside the station, its glass windows gleaming, shelves stocked with goods. Behind the counter, Frank nearly dropped his scale when he spotted Luna.

"Come in and warm up!" Mabel pushed her into a chair by the stove before bustling off to make orange drink.

Frank finished with a customer and rushed over, eyes glistening. "We finally found you! If not for your warning back then, your aunt and I would still be in the dark."

They’d taken Luna’s advice and discovered their so-called "nephew" had ulterior motives. Now their three daughters visited often with their grandchildren, filling the house with laughter.

"We used all our savings to buy this shop," Mabel said proudly, gesturing at the shelves. "Ten times better than the old one."

Luna cradled the warm drink, her heart just as warm. In the firelight, the couple’s wrinkles softened—their happiness was genuine.

When it was time to leave, Frank pressed a heavy bundle into her arms. "Visit often. Consider us family!"

Luna ran toward the station with her arms full, a smile tugging at her lips. She wasn’t the only one who’d changed her fate—this warmth outshone even the stove’s heat.

In the distance, Ethan paced anxiously by the station entrance. Luna quickened her steps, memorizing the new address in her mind. Some bonds were worth cherishing.
###Chapter 259: The Decision to Move to the City

"Finally, you're back!" Ethan White's anxious heart settled the moment he spotted his younger sister. The station clock showed only ten minutes until departure—he'd been about to leave the three boys behind to search for her.

Luna White struggled forward, panting under the weight of her bulging bundle. Ethan hurried to take it, his arm dropping with the unexpected heft.

"What on earth did you buy?" he muttered, but the departure bell rang before he could ask further. The five of them scrambled to buy tickets and squeezed into the overcrowded carriage.

Every seat was taken. Quick-witted Ethan Jackson set their woven basket atop the engine cover, and the three boys immediately claimed this "prime spot." The driver barely glanced their way—as long as it didn’t interfere with maintenance, such things were tacitly allowed.

The carriage was packed tighter than sardines, the air thick with mingled odors. After over an hour of jolting along the potholed rural road, they tumbled out at their stop, thoroughly disheveled.

"Ugh—" The three boys crouched by the roadside, vomiting violently. Their first long-distance bus ride on such a rough road had been a trial by fire.

Back home, Luna Whitaker was gathering sun-dried bedding when she spotted them. She set aside her work and rushed over.

"Did you buy out the entire market?" she scolded, though her eyes sparkled with barely concealed delight.

Luna White's heart leapt. "Big sis, did you and Ryan Wallace reach an agreement?"

Luna Whitaker flushed and busied herself unpacking the New Year's goods from the basket. "Goodness! So much meat! You reckless girl, spending money the moment you earn it!"

"Sis—" Luna White linked arms with her affectionately. "Isn’t earning money meant to improve our lives? We had no choice before, but now that we can afford better, why keep suffering?"

Luna Whitaker sighed. "You're right, but... I'm just worried—"

"Worried about what? I'm here!" Luna White patted her chest. "Wait—you just said 'once we're in the city'... Does that mean you’ll come with me?"

Luna Whitaker nodded, though unease lingered in her voice. "But what about Samuel's schooling—"

"Leave it to me!" Luna White's eyes brightened. "The General promised to help with family arrangements. Sis, this is wonderful—you taking this step!"

The boys, drawn by the commotion, crowded around. "Mom! Are we really moving to the city?"

Ethan Jackson puffed out his chest. "Aaron and I can work! We heard factories are hiring—we'll get jobs when we're older!"

Watching her children's excitement, Luna Whitaker finally relaxed into a genuine smile. She knew it—a new life was about to begin.
###Chapter 260: A New Beginning

"You shouldn't be doing such heavy work. I'm still young enough," Luna Whitaker's voice trembled slightly as her fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her apron. "And besides, Ryan will help." She hesitated before continuing, "There'll be one more person in our home soon... Would you be alright with Ryan living with us?"

The three boys exchanged glances before breaking into smiles.

"We'd love that!" Ethan Whitaker declared, his younger brothers nodding enthusiastically.

To them, Ryan had long been family—the tall figure who always appeared during harvest season, the warm smile that came with pockets full of candy. Most importantly, they'd seen how tenderly he treated their mother.

Luna's eyes welled up. She hadn't expected such immediate acceptance.

"Wonderful!" Luna White threw her arms around her sister while Ethan Whitaker affectionately ruffled his nephews' hair. The kitchen filled with laughter.

As they prepared dinner, Luna White finally voiced the question she'd been holding back.

"Sis, you and Ryan... is this official now?"

The rolling pin in Luna Whitaker's hands stilled momentarily, a shy yet radiant smile blooming across her face.

"Yes. He proposed." Her voice softened. "But he promised his parents not to use the Wallace family's pig-farming skills. We've calculated—just farming and raising chickens will make life tight."

The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering light across her determined profile.

"He wanted to work in the city first, to build us a new house before marrying me. But remembering what you said about opportunities..." Luna Whitaker drew a steadying breath. "Better we face city gossip together than endure village whispers. I've survived worse. With him beside me, I fear nothing."

Luna White added another log to the fire, making the flames dance in her bright eyes.

"Trust me, the city's full of possibilities. I can arrange the boys' schooling. If you and Ryan want to start a small business, I'll help with capital." She clasped her sister's work-roughened hands. "With hard work, life will be better than village struggles."

Tears threatened again. This younger sister she'd once protected had become her pillar of strength.

"Luna... I worried you'd laugh at me." Luna Whitaker's voice cracked. "So soon after leaving Darren—"

"Sis!" Luna White interrupted. "After all you've endured, finding someone who truly cherishes you? I couldn't be happier!"

A tear splashed onto the dough. Luna Whitaker hastily wiped it away.

"Oh dear, now the dough will be salty," Luna White teased, earning a playful swat.

"Where's Ryan?" Luna White suddenly asked.

"He said... it wouldn't be proper to stay here before marriage." Pink tinged Luna Whitaker's cheeks as she produced a cloth bundle from her pocket—neatly folded bills inside. "Gave me all his savings."

Luna White nodded approvingly. A man willing to entrust his entire livelihood spoke volumes.

"Let the boys take him dinner," she suggested. "Why not... register your marriage before New Year? Then you can return to the city with us."

Luna Whitaker froze. She hadn't anticipated such forward planning.

"Village gossip..." Luna White lowered her voice. "We won't hear it after leaving."

The hearth fire burned brighter, mirroring the new life about to ignite.
###Chapter 261: Fried Meatballs

On the morning of December 26th, before dawn had fully broken, Luna Whitaker was already bustling in the kitchen. Her sister, Luna White, rolled up her sleeves and worked alongside her, the two moving in perfect harmony.

"Sis, I've already seasoned the meat filling," Luna White said, expertly mixing the ingredients in the bowl. The filling was no simple mixture—finely minced pork blended with shredded white radish, diced tofu, and sweet potato starch, bound together with two eggs and a generous sprinkle of five-spice powder. The aroma was irresistible.

Luna Whitaker smiled approvingly. "You've outdone me with your skills."

Just two days ago, she had officially married Ryan Wallace. The thought still brought a faint blush to her cheeks. Though they hadn’t held a wedding banquet yet, she considered herself blessed to have found a man who truly cherished her.

She could still picture Mayor George Clark’s stunned expression when he signed their marriage certificate. Who would have thought old Walter Wallace, known for his stubbornness, would allow his son to marry a divorced woman? And Ryan—he had willingly given up everything to be with her.

"The oil’s hot!" Ethan Jackson’s voice snapped her out of her thoughts. He crouched by the stove, feeding firewood into the flames, his cheeks flushed from the heat.

Luna White deftly scooped up a handful of filling, squeezed it gently between her fingers, and let a perfectly round meatball slide into the sizzling oil. The golden bubbles danced excitedly around it.

"Smells amazing!" Ethan inhaled deeply, his eyes fixed on the browning meatballs.

Luna White fished one out, blew on it, and handed it to him. "Try it."

Ethan popped it into his mouth, hissing at the heat but refusing to spit it out. "So good! Way better than Grandma’s!"

"Of course—ours has more meat!" Luna White grinned, her hands never pausing as she fried batch after batch, soon filling a large basin with golden-brown meatballs.

In another pot, beef that had been braising overnight released a mouthwatering aroma. Luna Whitaker busied herself brushing honey over boiled pork belly, using a bamboo skewer to prick tiny holes into the skin.

"Not bad yourself, sis," Luna White remarked, peering over.

Luna Whitaker smiled faintly. "Learned from the best. Back then, we were lucky to have plain vegetable meatballs for New Year’s."

The sisters exchanged a glance, both seeing the same hope for the future reflected in each other’s eyes. This year’s celebration would be different.

The rich scents drifting from their yard drew curious neighbors peeking over fences. "The Whitakers are really doing well this year," someone murmured enviously.

By sunset, all the New Year’s dishes were ready—fried meatballs, braised beef, roasted pork, crispy pork bites—spread across every corner of the kitchen.

Luna White wiped her brow, satisfied. The suffering she endured in her past life would be repaid tenfold in this one. She would make sure her family had the joyful, abundant New Year she remembered.

"Tomorrow, we’ll slaughter the chickens. The day after, we’ll steam the buns," Luna Whitaker planned aloud. "This New Year… it’s shaping up to be special."

As night fell, the rhythmic chopping of meat fillings echoed through the village. The New Year was truly drawing near.
###Chapter 262 Homecoming

On the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month, Iris White and Henry Cooper returned home with their three children, weary from the journey but brimming with excitement. Their two vintage bicycles were laden with New Year's provisions, while the children squeezed onto the back seats, their cheeks flushed from the cold yet glowing with joy at being home.

Luna White nearly remarked on the excess of their belongings but bit back her words, remembering her younger sister's advice. As long as Iris was happy, what did it matter? She wasn’t the type to be wasteful.

"Big sis, I didn’t buy all this," Iris said, reading her sister’s thoughts. "Factory Manager Green insisted on giving them to me. When he heard Luna was back, he prepared these gifts. I couldn’t refuse—it was his kindness..."

Luna frowned slightly. "Such generous gifts—how will we repay them?" She worried her sister might feel indebted at work.

Luna smiled and linked arms with Iris. "Don’t worry, sis. The manager values my medical skills and wants to build goodwill. Later, we can send some of our homemade specialties back with Iris."

Iris’s expression darkened as she remembered something. "But it’s strange—William still hasn’t returned, and it’s already the twenty-ninth. Henry is frantic. Could you ask around when you go back?"

Luna found it odd too. William wasn’t the type to neglect his family—why hadn’t he even sent a letter? Everyone longed to return home for the New Year.

"I’ll look into it as soon as I’m back. You should also ask the folks from your factory—he must know someone there," Luna reassured her.

Luna brought out the prepared offering basket. According to their hometown tradition, the twenty-ninth was the day to visit their parents’ graves. The four siblings walked silently toward the back hill, their footprints marking the snow-covered path.

Kneeling before her adoptive parents’ graves, Luna bowed deeply three times. Their kindness had been as vast as the mountains and as deep as the sea. She lit incense, watching as the smoke curled upward.

Mom, Dad... we’re all doing well... she whispered in her heart. In the next life, I’d still want to be your daughter...

Meanwhile, at the Smith family villa.

Andrew Smith descended the stairs briskly, dressed in an olive-green military shirt. Today was the family reunion, but he had arrived too late the night before to see anyone.

"Dad, I’m back," he said, taking a seat at the dining table and biting into a fried dough stick.

Aunt Nian hurried over with a bowl of soy milk. "Andrew, there’s also red bean porridge..."

"Your red bean porridge is the best," Andrew said, making the elderly woman beam with delight.

He greeted his eldest brother, Andrew Sr., his sister-in-law, and his younger brother, Adrian, pointedly ignoring his stepmother, Evelyn Smith, who sat beside their father.

"Second Brother, why aren’t you greeting Mom?" Adrian frowned. Raised by Evelyn, he couldn’t stand any disrespect toward her.

Evelyn waved a hand, her smile gentle. "No need for formalities among family. Andrew, how long can you stay this time?"

"Returning to base on the fourth," Andrew replied flatly, his expression unreadable.

Mr. Smith set down his newspaper and fixed his second son with a stern look. "You’re not getting any younger. Your mother has arranged meetings with a few young women—take these days to see them."

Andrew’s grip on his chopsticks tightened slightly. So, this was his stepmother’s scheme. He glanced at his father, then at Evelyn’s unchanging smile, a cold smirk forming in his heart.

Beneath the surface of this family gathering, undercurrents swirled.
###Chapter 263: Over My Dead Body

"Dad, I—" Andrew Smith began, only to be cut off by his younger brother.

"Dad! Second Brother has a girlfriend!" The younger Smith slammed his hands on the table, grinning. "Everyone in the neighborhood knows Diana has been waiting for him all these years. Come on, Second Brother, you're the man—why are you dragging your feet when she's too shy to make the first move?"

He was practically gushing. In his eyes, Diana was the perfect woman—gentle, thoughtful, and always bringing him treats whenever she visited. A girl like her deserved better than his cold, stoic brother.

Elizabeth Green's head snapped up. She hadn't put him up to this. That foolish niece of hers had gone behind her back and manipulated the boy? Utterly idiotic.

"Don't talk nonsense," she interrupted sharply. "Your brother isn't that kind of man."

She knew Andrew too well. This clumsy scheme would only backfire. As for that Luna White... Elizabeth's lips curled in disdain. Just some nobody doctor with no connections. Crushing her would be child's play.

But Alan Smith perked up. "Diana's a good girl. Andrew, if you like her, you should settle things sooner rather than later."

"Dad!" The eldest Smith brother scoffed. "You think trash like Diana is worthy? You already married one disaster—now you want to drag Second Brother down too?"

"You insolent—!" Alan slammed his fist on the table. "What's wrong with Diana? How dare you speak like that! And she's your mother!"

"My mother died years ago!" The eldest brother shot to his feet, his chair screeching against the floor. "I lost her when I was eight."

The living room plunged into suffocating silence.

Alan's hands trembled. "You... you're still holding onto that?"

"Holding onto it?" The eldest brother's smile was razor-sharp. "Dad, you made me lie and say I got lost on my own—just to protect her. From that day on, I stopped having a father."

His gaze shifted to Elizabeth, cold as steel. "Listen carefully. Stay away from my brother. You ruined me—but over my dead body will you ruin him too."

Elizabeth gripped Alan's hand so tightly her nails drew blood. She knew better than to doubt his words. The eldest Smith always kept his promises.
###Chapter 264: Confrontation

Andrew felt his wife's trembling hand, and fury instantly surged through him. He slammed his fist on the solid oak table with a loud bang.

Andrew Sr. had already risen to his feet, casting a cold glance around the room. "Seems this meal is over. Andrew Jr., I've reserved a private room at Jade Pavilion for six tonight. Just the two of us." He gave Andrew Jr.'s shoulder a firm pat before turning on his heel and striding out.

His wife, Xenia, quickly stood up, offering an apologetic smile. "Mom, Dad, Andrew Jr., I'm so sorry. He's always been like this..." She shot Andrew Jr. a meaningful look before hurrying after her husband.

Andrew Sr. slumped back into his chair as if aged a decade in moments. His wife, Sophia, gently took his hand, her voice soothing. "Don't upset yourself, dear. The children are grown—they have their own minds now."

"That ungrateful brat!" Andrew Sr. struck the table again. "What did I do in my past life to deserve such a disgraceful son?"

Andrew Jr. watched in silence. His father's high blood pressure could flare up at any moment, and saying anything now would only make things worse. His thoughts drifted to Luna—her bright, fearless eyes, the way she lived so freely and passionately.

"I'm going to change," he announced, heading upstairs.

His younger brother, Alex, rushed to intercept him. "Andrew, Diana's coming soon—"

"There's nothing between us," Andrew Jr. cut him off coldly. "Don't drag me into it again."

Alex stomped his foot in frustration. "How can you say that? Diana's waited for you all these years—"

Andrew Sr. watched his second son disappear upstairs, bitterness swelling in his chest. What was supposed to be a happy family reunion had turned into this mess.

Sophia helped Andrew Sr. upstairs to rest, murmuring reassurances. Alex followed, offering his own comfort. "Don't worry, Dad. Mom and I will take care of you."

Andrew Sr. gave his youngest son a grateful look. At least one of his children still had sense.

Once Andrew Sr. was settled, Sophia pulled Alex into the hallway.

"Listen to me," she said in a hushed tone. "Stop bringing up Diana and your brother."

Alex protested, "But Diana—"

Sophia's sharp eyes caught something. "Wait—do you have feelings for Diana?"

"N-no!" Alex's face flushed instantly.

Sophia smiled knowingly. "Good. I'll find you a better match."

Alex lowered his head, fingers twisting nervously. The hallway light stretched his shadow long and solitary against the wall.
###Chapter 265: The Share Dispute

As evening fell, Andrew Smith arrived punctually to pick up his younger brother. The two brothers walked side by side out of the Smith family estate, their shadows stretching long under the fading sunset.

Their father, Mr. Smith, hadn't come downstairs all day. When Andrew visited him at noon, he found the old man in much better spirits. Age had taken its toll—his blood pressure spikes left him dizzy and weak, requiring rest. The father and son chatted amiably, both carefully avoiding the sensitive topic of Andrew's marriage. Andrew entertained his father with vivid tales from military life, drawing hearty laughter from the elder Smith.

"Don't worry, Dad. I'm doing just fine in the army," Andrew said, tucking the blanket around his father.

Mr. Smith gazed at his son's resolute profile with pride. This boy was born to be a soldier—his sharp instincts and exceptional skills had earned him respect in the ranks without relying on his father's military connections. Thinking of how his old comrades' children had either left the service or pursued business ventures, the old general sat a little straighter with satisfaction.

Once in the car, Andrew noticed his brother's grim expression.

"Trouble?" he asked with concern. The brothers had always shared everything.

Andrew shook his head. "Just some minor business issues. Nothing you can help with." He studied his brother. "You, on the other hand—I can never reach you by phone lately. Pushing yourself in training again?"

Andrew grinned. "New unit, new reputation to establish. A few troublemakers just need to be put in their place." He flexed his wrist. "Soldiers solve problems simply."

"You!" His brother sighed in exasperation, pulling up to a lavish hotel. "Always loved a good fight. Now you've made it your career."

Andrew hopped out, surveying the grand building. "The capital's changed so much."

"Come on. Tonight's my treat." His brother slung an arm around his shoulders. "Their Cantonese chef was poached from Guangzhou at a premium. The seafood is exceptional."

Inside the private dining room, after ordering, Andrew's brother produced a document with a mysterious air.

"Take a look—your dividends for this year." He slid a check across the table. "The company's done well."

Andrew pushed it back without glancing. "You know military regulations."

"Cut the act!" His brother glared. "If not for that three thousand you lent me that rainy night, Smith Enterprises wouldn't exist today. These shares are yours!"

Andrew remembered that night in '82—finding his down-and-out brother outside the cinema, the stubborn fire in his eyes. It was the first time he'd ever called in a favor from a comrade to borrow money.

"That was a loan," Andrew said, pouring them both a glass of whiskey. "Besides, seeing you build this company is reward enough."

His brother downed his drink in one gulp. "Don't give me that! The books have always been clear—your share's been set aside." His eyes reddened. "If you refuse, I'll shut the whole company down!"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Andrew frowned. "What about everyone who's worked hard for you?"

"I don't care!" His brother pouted like a child. "When you get married, I'll just transfer the money to your wife's account."

Andrew suddenly pictured Luna's stubborn little face and couldn't suppress a smile.

"What's so funny?" His brother caught the expression instantly. "Wait—is there someone?"

Andrew raised his glass to hide his face. "Drink up! Tonight, I won't stop until you're under the table!"

"You brat!" His brother laughed, clinking glasses, but inwardly resolved to investigate his brother's love life.
###Chapter 266: The Confession

"Brother, I submitted my marriage report!" Andrew Smith announced the moment he stepped through the door. His elder brother, Andrew Sr., was the first person he wanted to tell.

Andrew Sr. nearly dropped his teacup. "What? Don’t tell me it’s that girl, Diana! She’s nothing but a pretty face—useless. And you know exactly what kind of ties she has to that woman!"

Andrew calmly poured himself a glass of whiskey and downed it in one gulp. "Good stuff. You’re overthinking it, brother. Her name’s Luna White—a girl I saved while stationed in the countryside. She’ll be nineteen after the New Year. We’ll marry when she turns twenty."

"A country girl?" Andrew Sr.’s frown deepened. "Don’t get me wrong, I don’t look down on rural folks, but those tangled family ties will be a nightmare for you!"

"Luna’s different." Andrew refilled his brother’s glass. "She’s a doctor now. Both her parents passed away, and she only has a few siblings left. Her eldest brother was my comrade—just as capable as I am."

Andrew Sr. raised an eyebrow. "A doctor at nineteen? No strings pulled?"

"Family tradition—acupuncture." Andrew’s eyes gleamed. "Remember Nathaniel Smith, that troublemaker from the Turner family? She saved him. Now they call her 'Luna the Healer' at the hospital."

Andrew Sr. studied his brother for a long moment before suddenly laughing. "You really do like her." His younger brother had always been picky—this was the first time he’d ever praised someone so highly.

"Brother..." Andrew’s ears turned faintly pink.

"Fine, as long as you’re happy." Andrew Sr. lowered his voice. "But you know Father won’t let this slide easily. And that woman—she won’t give up her claim on you."

Andrew’s expression darkened. "We’ll deal with it when Luna’s old enough. Telling Father now would just spike his blood pressure."

"When are you bringing her to meet us?" Andrew Sr. suddenly perked up. "Bring her for New Year’s! Father won’t make a scene in front of guests."

"Next time. She went back to her hometown for the holidays." Andrew deftly changed the subject and topped off their glasses again.

Andrew Sr. slammed the table. "Leave the wedding arrangements to me! House, car, furniture—I’ll handle everything. Don’t argue. That girl’s already settling for you—she deserves a proper home."

"It’s too early..."

"Too early, my foot!" Andrew Sr. cut him off. "After New Year’s, I’m opening a branch office in your area. Perfect chance to meet my future sister-in-law. And I’ll get your wedding home ready—I’ll need a place to stay anyway."

Andrew sighed. "Brother..."

"Honestly, I should just have Father transfer you both back to the capital." Andrew Sr. warmed to the idea. "Once you have kids, you can’t raise them in that frozen wasteland—"

"Enough!" Andrew laughed helplessly. "We’re not even married yet, and you’re talking about kids? Besides, if other families can manage there, why can’t we?"

"Fine, you’re impossible to reason with right now." Andrew Sr. raised his glass. "You’ll understand when you’re a father. Cheers!"

By the end of the night, Andrew Sr. had to be carried home. Andrew handed his drunken brother over to his sister-in-law, whose face was stormy with irritation. He offered an apologetic smile—this happened every year. He was used to it.
###Chapter 267: Reunion Night

The crisp sound of dough hitting the cutting board echoed through the steamy kitchen as Luna White tossed down another freshly rolled dumpling wrapper. Three women bustled about in the warmth, their movements quick and practiced.

"Iris, is the filling ready?" Luna wiped the sweat from her brow with the back of her hand.

Maya White stirred the meat mixture in the bowl with practiced ease. "Almost done. Go check on the kids and see how they're doing with the decorations."

Outside, Ethan's voice carried across the yard. "A little higher on the left! Yes, just like that!" Three teenage boys balanced on stools, carefully pasting red couplets onto the doorframe. The youngest, Aaron, held up the bowl of glue, his cheeks flushed pink from the cold.

"Aunt Iris!" Aaron dashed toward her the moment he spotted her. "Do you like how we did it?"

Iris ruffled his hair affectionately. "Perfect. I'll give you your New Year's money later."

Back in the kitchen, Luna dropped dumplings into the boiling pot one by one. The water bubbled furiously as the plump dumplings swirled inside. She lowered her voice suddenly. "Maya, are you really not going to invite Ryan over?"

Maya's hand jerked, nearly knocking over the seasoning bowl. "It's New Year's Eve... It wouldn't be proper..."

"What's improper about it?" Luna scooped the cooked dumplings onto a plate. "He's practically family now."

Just then, a burst of noise erupted from outside. The three boys came running in, surrounding a tall figure. Ethan grinned triumphantly. "Mom! I brought Uncle Ryan!"

Ryan Wallace stood awkwardly in the doorway, clutching a cloth bundle like a child caught misbehaving. Maya's face burned crimson, and the spatula slipped from her fingers with a clatter.

Ethan darted forward and took the bundle from Ryan. "Perfect timing, brother! Fresh dumplings just came out—come sit at the table!"

"I..." Ryan glanced uncertainly at Maya, who kept her eyes downcast, making him even more nervous.

Luna seized the moment, nudging him inside. "Don't stand on ceremony, Ryan. Tonight's all about family!"

The low dining table was already laden with dishes. Six steaming bowls sat alongside two large platters of dumplings. From the children's room came peals of laughter, mingling with the cheerful tune of the "New Year's Overture" playing on the radio.

Ryan's hands trembled slightly as he was guided to his seat. Ethan poured him a drink. "Brother, let's toast!"

Finally, Maya lifted her gaze—only to meet Ryan's damp, earnest eyes. She bit her lip and quietly slipped a piece of crispy pork into his bowl.

"Thank you... all of you." Ryan's voice cracked as he downed the drink in one gulp.

Luna winked at Maya, earning a glare in return. But everyone saw the glimmer of tears at the corners of Maya's eyes.

The radio chimed midnight, and outside, firecrackers exploded in a joyous cacophony. Under the cover of laughter and chatter, Ryan gently took Maya's hand and whispered, "Happy New Year."

Maya didn't pull away. She simply nodded, her face still flushed. No words were needed. Outside, the red lanterns cast a warm glow on the snow, illuminating every smiling face in the room.
###Chapter 268: A Simple Promise

The heated brick bed radiated warmth, filling the room with cozy comfort. Luna White deftly uncorked two bottles of premium liquor, its rich aroma instantly permeating the air.

"Can't let a day like this pass without a drink," Ethan White chuckled as he filled Ryan Wallace's glass before turning to Henry Cooper.

Luna Whitaker sat blushing at the edge of the bed, deliberately keeping her distance from Ryan. Luna noticed this and stood up with her glass raised.

"Brother Ryan, this first toast is for you!"

Ryan quickly lifted his cup. He knew full well—this seemingly delicate young woman was the true backbone of the family. The village's only college graduate, the mayor's goddaughter—this girl was anything but ordinary.

"My sister suffered through the first half of her life, enduring humiliation all these years for our family's sake," Luna's voice trembled slightly. "That you'd go this far for her makes you a real man in my eyes!"

They drained their glasses in one go.

Luna poured a second round, and Ethan wordlessly refilled Ryan's cup.

"This second toast—I'm entrusting my sister's future to you." Luna's gaze suddenly sharpened. "I may be young and hot-tempered, but one thing's certain—"

She slammed her glass onto the table with a thud. "Anyone who dares hurt my sister will pay dearly, even if it costs me my life!"

Ryan downed his drink in one gulp and wiped his mouth. "Little sister, I understand your feelings. But my kindness to Luna isn't out of fear—it's because I genuinely care for her."

His rough hand gently clasped Luna Whitaker's trembling fingers. "I may not have grand talents, but I swear my wife and children will never go hungry or cold. And I'll never lay a finger on her."

These simple words moved hearts more than any sweet talk ever could.

Luna's eyes welled up as she raised her glass a third time. "Brother-in-law! For that promise alone, I toast you!"

"May sister and brother-in-law grow old together in happiness!" the siblings chorused their blessing.

Ryan's throat tightened—that title of "brother-in-law" meant more to him than anything.

The New Year's Eve feast was filled with laughter and joy. Luna's cooking earned endless praise, and the cheerful holiday programs on the radio added to the festive atmosphere.

When the clock struck midnight, the men took the children outside to set off firecrackers. Amid the deafening explosions, the four White siblings exchanged smiles, their gazes drifting unconsciously to their parents' memorial tablets on the altar.

Mom, Dad—we're doing just fine.

Meanwhile, the atmosphere at the Wallace household was decidedly gloomier.

Old Walter Wallace puffed sullenly on his pipe, tapping it loudly against the bedframe. His wife wiped her tears as she set the table. "On New Year's Eve, our Ryan's all alone in that broken-down shack without even a hot meal..."

The two daughters-in-law worked quietly in the kitchen, not daring to make a sound.

"Dad, I'm going to get big brother!" Second son Nathaniel Wallace suddenly stood up.

"Nonsense!" Old Walter barked, though his pipe stopped its incessant tapping.

Third son Joseph Wallace silently followed his brother's lead. Seeing her husband's softening expression, the old woman whispered, "Don't say anything harsh when the boy comes home."

"Hmph! Not unless he agrees to cut ties with that White girl!" Old Walter grumbled stubbornly, though his eyes kept darting toward the door.

In the dilapidated shack, Ryan huddled under a thin blanket when suddenly, familiar footsteps sounded outside...
###Chapter 269: The Rift

Steaming dumplings had just been placed on the table when the two grandsons eagerly scrambled over. The three-year-old already reached out with his tiny hand, trying to grab one to stuff into his mouth.

A light smack—the old woman gently swatted his hand away. "Wait until your uncle comes back!" she scolded, though her eyes involuntarily flicked toward the courtyard.

Old Man Walter sat on the edge of the kang, his pipe tapping impatiently against the wooden frame. "Where the hell are those two rascals?" he grumbled, casting another glance outside.

His wife chuckled. "Just admit you miss your son, old man. No need to pretend."

"Who said I miss him?" Walter's face darkened. "I just don’t want the dumplings to get cold and upset the boys' stomachs!"

Just then, the door curtain lifted, and the second and third sons stepped in, bringing a gust of cold air with them.

"Where’s your brother?" the old woman asked urgently.

Nathaniel rubbed his hands together. "The cave was pitch black. We knocked for ages, but no one answered."

The room fell silent. The old woman’s expression shifted as realization dawned.

Bang! Walter slammed his pipe onto the low table. "From now on, no one mentions that ungrateful son of mine! He can go wherever he pleases—he’s no longer part of this family!"

The two younger sons lowered their heads, not daring to speak. The New Year’s Eve dinner passed in heavy silence, broken only by the grandchildren’s laughter.

After the meal, Walter gathered everyone in the inner room. His face was stormy as he declared, "Starting today, Ryan Wallace is no longer my son. If any of you dare to help him behind my back, don’t bother coming home!"

Tears welled in the old woman’s eyes, while the two sons exchanged uneasy glances. They knew their father meant every word.

"Dad, about Ryan—" the youngest began.

"Shut your mouth!" Walter slammed the table. "He threw away a perfectly good pig-farming trade to run off with that divorced woman. Let’s see how far he gets without his skills!"

In the next room, the daughters-in-law sighed. Since Ryan had left, the second and third sons had been working nonstop. They all knew—without Ryan, the family had lost its backbone.

Late into the night, Walter sat alone on the kang, smoking in brooding silence. Outside, firecrackers crackled in celebration, but to him, the noise was nothing but grating.

"Luna Whitaker," he muttered through gritted teeth. "Let’s see how much suffering you bring my son!"

Meanwhile, in the Whitaker courtyard, the scene was entirely different. Ryan helped Luna wrap dumplings while Ethan and Samuel assisted. Amid the laughter and chatter, no one noticed the complicated emotions hidden in Ryan’s occasional glances toward the Wallace home.

This New Year’s Eve would leave a deep rift between the two families—one that time might never fully heal.
###Chapter 270: A New Year's Dawn

Luna White was jolted awake by the crackling sounds outside her window. Rubbing her eyes, she noticed the faint light of dawn creeping through the curtains. Last night, they had stayed up late to welcome the New Year, but exhaustion had eventually claimed them all.

"Auntie! Auntie, wake up!" Hannah's cheerful voice called from the hallway.

Luna quickly threw on her coat and opened the door. Six eager children, dressed in their finest new clothes, crowded in, their eyes sparkling with excitement.

"Happy New Year, Auntie!" they chorused.

Luna smiled, ruffling their hair. "Happy New Year! You're all up so early?"

"We're waiting for our red envelopes!" Hannah blinked up at her, tiny hands already outstretched.

Luna chuckled and turned to fetch the prepared envelopes. Just then, Maya entered with a steaming tray of dumplings from the kitchen. "Patience, everyone. Eat first, then you'll get your gifts."

The children cheered and gathered around the table. Luna noticed the faint shadows under Maya's eyes—she must have risen even earlier.

"Sis, why didn't you sleep a little longer?" Luna asked, accepting a bowl.

Maya wiped her hands. "Who sleeps in on New Year's Day?" She pulled a red envelope from her pocket. "For you, Luna. Happy New Year."

Luna hesitated. "I'm working now—I shouldn't take—"

"Take it!" Maya pressed it into her hand. "To me, you'll always be the little sister I need to look after."

Luna's throat tightened as she clutched the envelope. Just then, Ethan, Iris, and Henry arrived, filling the room with lively chatter.

"Time to greet the elders!" Ethan announced. The six children knelt in a neat row, bowing three times in perfect unison.

"Happy New Year, Aunties and Uncles! May you be healthy and prosperous!"

The adults laughed, handing out red envelopes. The children tore into theirs immediately.

"Wow! Auntie Luna gave the most!" Hannah waved a crisp dollar bill triumphantly.

Maya frowned. "Luna, you're spoiling them."

"Sis, no lectures on New Year's Day," Luna teased, smoothing Hannah's hair. "Besides, it's motivation. Hannah, tell me—do you want to go to college someday?"

"Yes!" Hannah nodded fiercely. "I want to be as amazing as you!"

Ethan roared with laughter. "That's the spirit!" He turned to Maya. "Let them dream big. Don't fuss over a little money."

After breakfast, the children scampered outside to play. Maya lowered her voice while clearing the table. "Ryan said he's coming for lunch."

Luna winked. "Finally making it official?"

"We're leaving after the fifth anyway." A blush crept up Maya's cheeks. "Let people talk."

Just then, Ethan called, "Come on, let's visit Grandma."

At Clara's house, the courtyard was eerily quiet. Inside, the elderly woman sat alone on the cold bed, her breath visible in the unheated room.

"Grandma, why no fire?" Ethan hurried to add coal to the stove.

Clara sighed. "Your uncle left early to visit others..."

Luna and Maya exchanged glances—anger and heartache mirrored in their eyes. How could anyone abandon their elder on New Year's Day?

"Grandma, come stay with us," Luna urged, clasping Clara's icy hands.

Clara shook her head, tears glistening. "It's bad luck to visit others' homes today. Just seeing you is enough..."

Ethan stood abruptly. "I'm going to find Uncle Jack. This is unacceptable!"

Maya stopped him. "Not today. Let's keep the peace." She turned to Clara. "We'll bring you lunch, Grandma."

As they left, Luna glanced back at the once-lively home, her heart heavy. New Year's joy wasn't universal—but life marched on regardless.

She clenched her fists. This year, she vowed, her family would know nothing but happiness.
###Chapter 271: Regrets Too Late

"Ethan's here! Come closer and let Grandma take a good look at you!" Clara White's wrinkled face brightened as she beckoned to Ethan.

Ethan knelt properly and kowtowed. "Happy New Year, Grandma." His sisters followed suit. The elderly women nearby watched with envy—everyone knew Clara lived comfortably now. Her youngest son lived with her, and she ruled the household. The eldest son’s children had all made something of themselves: a soldier, a factory worker, a doctor in the city. Even the divorced eldest granddaughter, raising three children while tending chickens and pigs, outshone others.

This New Year, they had returned in a car—something the villagers had never seen before. The eldest White family had truly risen. It was a shame the eldest son had passed early; otherwise, he would have enjoyed this prosperity.

"Good, good! Get up now!" Clara grinned, her eyes crinkling with joy.

Since her last stroke, the old woman had never regained the weight she’d lost. Luna observed coldly that Clara seemed livelier than before. Clearly, Jack White wasn’t faring well these days.

The elderly women tactfully stood. "It’s the New Year—we should visit other homes too." With that, they left.

Clara pulled Ethan onto the heated bed and waved at Iris and Luna. "Come sit!"

Luna clung to Luna’s sleeve, refusing to let go. Luna understood her sister’s hesitation. After how Clara and their uncle had treated her, followed by the truth about her parentage, it was natural for Luna to hold resentment. Still, she hoped the family could at least maintain appearances.

Reluctantly, Luna sat down.

Clara shakily retrieved several red envelopes from the bed cabinet and pressed one into each of their hands. "This year, I’m following the city folks’ tradition—New Year’s money. Don’t mind how little it is."

Luna clenched the envelope, her emotions in turmoil. After years of hatred, this sudden change left her at a loss.

Clara bore responsibility for the tragedies of Luna’s past life. Did the old woman’s repentance now erase that? Luna couldn’t accept it. Not seeking revenge after her rebirth was mercy enough—expecting her to smile and play nice? Impossible.

"Grandma, where’s Jack and the others? How could they leave you alone on New Year’s? The house is freezing—didn’t they prepare enough firewood?" Ethan frowned.

Clara scoffed. "That precious son of mine took his wife to curry favor with Bai Zhuang’s future in-laws. They’d sooner see me dead than care if I freeze."

Ethan sighed. Iris and Luna went out to fetch firewood, stoking the stove until warmth filled the room.

"Grandma, after the New Year, Luna is bringing the kids to the city with us. I don’t like leaving you here alone. Why not come with us?" Ethan asked earnestly.

Luna turned her face away, pretending not to hear.

"Luna should go. With you all in the city, she won’t have to endure the village gossip." Clara shook her head. "This old bones isn’t going anywhere. This house and land will be yours, Ethan. I’ll guard them for you—won’t let Jack take advantage."

Ethan grew anxious. "But Uncle treats you like this—"

"Don’t worry." Clara patted his hand. "After what happened last time, the Women’s Federation checks in regularly. They wouldn’t dare cause trouble now. I’ve wronged you all too much in this life. I won’t burden you further."

The old woman spoke with such sincerity that even Luna had to admit—this time, Clara truly seemed remorseful.
###Chapter 272: The Journey Home

After leaving Clara White's house, Luna White and her group headed to Mayor George Clark's home for New Year's greetings. The Clarks warmly insisted they stay for a meal, but in the end, only Ethan White and Luna remained while the others took the six children and left first, not wanting to overstay their welcome.

Shortly after the second day of the New Year, Iris White and Henry Cooper returned to town with their children. As the workshop supervisor, Iris had to report back to the factory for duty. The farewell was bittersweet—everyone knew it would be a long time before they saw each other again, scattered as they were across distant places.

After seeing Iris and Henry off, Luna and her sister Luna Whitaker began packing. With three children in tow, they struggled to part with anything. But the sheer volume of belongings forced Luna to make tough choices, setting aside items they wouldn’t need or that would be too cumbersome for the journey. Otherwise, even with extra hands, they’d never manage.

In the midst of packing, Lily Clark suddenly rushed in, calling Luna to the village committee office for a phone call.

"Who could be calling me now?" Luna wondered as she picked up the receiver.

"Luna, Happy New Year." The deep voice on the other end belonged to Andrew Smith, sending warmth flooding through her chest. In this era, a phone call just to say those words was rare.

"Happy New Year! You... how are you?" Her voice softened involuntarily.

"Not well. I miss you." His blunt words made her ears burn. She let out a quiet "Mm," her heartbeat quickening. This reserved man suddenly speaking so openly left her both startled and delighted.

"We’re returning on the fifth day." The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them—they sounded as if she couldn’t wait to see him.

"What time on the fifth? I’ll arrive on the fourth and come pick you up." His voice carried a smile.

"We haven’t settled on a time yet. It depends on when we get our tickets."

"Then I’ll call again the day after to confirm." The line fell silent except for their breathing.

Luna, her face flushed, murmured an agreement before suddenly remembering something. "Where are you now?"

"At home."

"Then... I’ll hang up first." The thought of Helen Turner possibly being there made her reluctant to cause him any trouble.

As she hung up, she met Lily’s teasing gaze, her cheeks growing even hotter.

"That was Instructor Andrew, wasn’t it?" Lily waggled her eyebrows.

Luna hurried away, Lily’s laughter ringing behind her.

On the third day of the New Year, Private Wu arrived with two fellow soldiers to pay their respects. As Andrew’s loyal admirers, they took it upon themselves to look after Luna. Luna and Luna Whitaker prepared a feast, and Ethan joined them as the four men drank and chatted merrily.

When they learned the group planned to return to the city on the fifth, Private Wu immediately promised to help secure train tickets. With the military’s connections, it wouldn’t be difficult.

True to his word, on the fourth day, Private Wu delivered seven sleeper tickets—all but one in adjacent berths. His efficiency left Luna amazed.

Luna Whitaker packed a generous bundle of fried snacks for Private Wu, who, after much polite refusal, finally succumbed to temptation. Before leaving, he promised to drive them to the station the next morning.

At dawn on the fifth day, Private Wu arrived in a truck. Luna, Luna Whitaker, and Samuel Jackson rode in the cab, while Ethan and the three boys, wrapped in coats, sat in the truck bed. The entire Clark family came to see them off, with Clara Clark crying so hard she became a mess. Luna soothed her by promising to bring them to the provincial capital for the next New Year.

No one noticed Lily watching Ryan Wallace and Samuel Jackson leave, quietly making up her mind. Later, she would buy a ticket alone, leaving only a letter before boarding a train to the provincial capital.

At the station, the seven of them boarded smoothly. The three excited boys scrambled to the upper bunks, while Luna and Luna Whitaker took the lower ones for easier supervision. Luna Whitaker’s heart was uneasy, filled with apprehension about the unknown life awaiting them in the city.

The train journey passed smoothly, and soon they arrived in the provincial capital. The moment Luna stepped out of the station, she spotted Andrew waiting at the exit. Their eyes met, and both smiled at the same time. Luna waved happily, all her worries vanishing in that instant.
###Chapter 273: The Wedding Approaches?

Andrew sprinted forward in three quick strides, taking the heavy bundle from Luna's hands with a tender smile. "Luna, Ethan, you're finally here!" He had known from Luna that her sister's family was coming to the city. Truth be told, he and Luna's sister were old acquaintances—he had helped her through her divorce back in the day.

Luna's sister watched as her brother-in-law doted on Luna, her heart swelling with joy. Not only was Andrew handsome, but he also treated Luna with such care. Her sister was truly blessed.

"Andrew, I'm sorry to trouble you during the holidays," Luna's sister said politely, speaking as the eldest sibling on behalf of the family.

Andrew effortlessly took the bag from her back. "Don't be so formal. We're family. You're Luna's sister, which makes you my sister too. If you keep being so polite, you'll hurt my feelings."

"Exactly! No need for formalities between family!" Luna's sister beamed. "We’ll be imposing on you during our stay in the city."

Andrew chuckled warmly. "The truck's waiting outside. Luna told me about your situation. You’ll stay at her dorm for now, but I’ve already asked a friend to help find a place. We should have news soon."

Luna's sister glanced at Luna worriedly. "I just don’t want to disrupt her work. The city isn’t like the countryside—you can’t just have relatives staying over whenever." Though Luna insisted it was fine, she still felt uneasy.

Luna opened the truck door. Andrew had borrowed a pickup especially for their arrival. They piled in, with Luna, her sister, and Samuel squeezing into the front seat. Luna sat close to Andrew, their legs nearly touching in the cramped cabin. If not for the gearshift between them, they might have been pressed even closer.

The masculine scent of him enveloped her. He wore dark green military trousers that accentuated his long, sturdy legs. His strong hands gripped the wheel firmly, his shirt buttoned neatly to the top, his Adam’s apple bobbing slightly as he spoke. The setting sun cast dappled light through the window, tracing the sharp angles of his profile.

Suddenly, Andrew turned his head, his deep gaze locking onto Luna’s. Her pulse stuttered, remembering his whispered "I missed you" over the phone. Heat rushed to her cheeks, and she quickly looked away, pretending to focus on the road ahead—but her heart refused to calm.

As the truck started, Andrew’s hand occasionally brushed against her leg when shifting gears. Even when she scooted closer to her sister, the fleeting contact sent warmth flooding through her.

"Andrew drives so smoothly," Luna's sister remarked admiringly. Though she knew nothing about driving, his effortless control spoke of experience.

"Keep praising me like that, and I’ll blush," Andrew replied with a grin.

Samuel suddenly piped up, "Uncle Andrew, remember me? I’m the youngest!"

"Of course I remember," Andrew glanced at him in the rearview mirror. "I carried you back to Six Paths Village. You’ve grown so much. How’s school?"

"My teacher says I can get into college if I work harder!" Samuel answered excitedly. His usually stern uncle being so friendly made him feel special.

"Study hard, and I’ll cover your tuition," Andrew said, glancing at Luna. "So your mom won’t have to worry."

"No need!" Luna's sister cut in firmly. "I’ll take care of my own children. I won’t let them grow dependent."

Andrew simply smiled.

Then Samuel blurted out, "Uncle Andrew, when are you marrying Aunt Luna?"

Luna froze.

"Samuel! Have you finished your winter break homework?" She quickly changed the subject, her face burning.

Luna's sister pinched her son’s arm sharply. "What nonsense are you spouting?"

"Mom! That hurts!" Samuel rubbed his arm, bewildered.

"Finish your homework tonight!" Luna ordered sternly.

"Why, Aunt Luna?" The boy looked utterly confused.

"No reason!" Luna narrowed her eyes. Why were kids so difficult these days?

"Oh..." Samuel slumped, then suddenly perked up again. "Uncle Andrew, you still haven’t answered me!"

Luna nearly choked on her own breath.

"When your aunt turns twenty," Andrew replied, his lips curving as he watched Luna’s flushed face. "I’d marry her tomorrow if the law allowed."

"That’s a relief," Samuel said sagely. "Otherwise, who’d take care of Aunt Luna?"

Luna couldn’t help but laugh. "Isn’t that your job?"

"I have school!" Samuel counted on his fingers. "I already take care of Mom. If I had to look after you too, I’d be too busy. Once Uncle Andrew marries you, he can take care of you every day!"

Luna's sister hugged her son. "Silly boy, but you’re not wrong."

Luna’s heart warmed. "Thank you for worrying about me, Samuel. I’ll marry soon so you don’t have to."

Her words sent a thrill through Andrew, as if he’d downed two bottles of fine wine. She wanted to marry him! The realization made him lightheaded, his grip on the wheel nearly slipping.
###Chapter 274: Arranging the New Home

Luna White's dormitory was a modest one-bedroom apartment, and with six people crammed inside, it felt uncomfortably tight. Only then did she realize she hadn't thought things through—sleeping on the floor in this weather would be far too cold.

"What should we do..." Luna bit her lip anxiously. There was only one bed, and having both men and women share the space was hardly appropriate.

Andrew Smith glanced around and suggested, "How about your brother-in-law and the three kids come with me? A friend of mine has an empty place—three bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen. It's just a bit far from the hospital."

Luna's sister, Luna Whitaker, brightened. "That's perfect!" She turned to her husband. "You can stay with Andrew for tonight, and tomorrow we'll go check out the place."

Luna White also sighed in relief. "Brother-in-law, sorry for the inconvenience."

Ryan Wallace gave a good-natured smile. "It's fine. If it comes down to it, we can always sleep on the floor in the living room." The three children nodded obediently.

But then Luna Whitaker hesitated. "Actually... maybe we shouldn't. It's just one night..." She couldn't bear to be apart from her children.

Luna White understood her sister's feelings. "Then how about this—I'll borrow some extra bedding. If we layer it thick enough, it shouldn't be too cold."

Andrew checked his watch. "It's 5:30 now. You all go ahead to the cafeteria for dinner. I'll go get the bedding." With that, he hurried out.

Luna led everyone in tidying up their belongings. When Luna Whitaker saw the refrigerator, she sneezed in surprise. "Why is this cabinet so cold?"

"That's a fridge—it keeps food fresh." Luna patiently explained how each appliance worked, leaving the family marveling at everything.

As they prepared to leave for the cafeteria, Luna Whitaker hesitated again. "Maybe we should just heat up some steamed buns at home?"

"Sis, the cafeteria uses meal tickets, and I have plenty left this month," Luna said with a laugh, gently nudging her toward the door. "If we don't go now, the cooks will be off duty."

Ryan watched as Luna effortlessly locked the door with a simple turn, once again amazed at how everything in the city was so novel. The three children, meanwhile, eagerly looked around, their eyes wide with curiosity at this unfamiliar urban world.
###Chapter 275: Canteen Incident

Luna White led her eldest sister's family of five into the hospital canteen as the lunch rush was winding down. The moment she stepped through the door, Chef Gao hurried over with a beaming smile.

"Happy New Year, Dr. White! Back to work so soon?" Chef Gao rubbed his hands together, his eyes darting toward Luna's sister and her family. Ever since Director Zhang had personally accompanied Luna, the entire canteen staff knew she was the director's favorite.

Luna smiled and nodded. "Happy New Year, Chef Gao. This is my eldest sister's family—they just got off the train, and there's nothing at home yet, so I brought them for a warm meal."

Chef Gao slapped his thigh. "Ah, perfect timing! We've got some special dishes for the holiday—dumplings, braised chicken with mushrooms, soy-braised pork trotters..."

"A bit of everything, please." Luna handed over her lunchbox. "And pack an extra serving of dumplings for me."

Soon, the table was laden with dishes—glossy soy-braised pork trotters steaming hot, golden braised chicken with mushrooms wafting an irresistible aroma. The three children stared wide-eyed, and the youngest, Samuel, even swallowed hard.

Luna's sister, Luna Whitaker, nervously tugged at her sleeve. "Luna, this... how much will this cost?"

"Don't worry, sis. I'm using meal vouchers." Luna pulled out a few ration coupons and waved them.

"Meal vouchers?" Luna Whitaker eyed them skeptically. In her experience, canteens served nothing but bland broth and plain rice—certainly not lavish spreads like this.

Chef Gao came by to collect the coupons, cheerfully adding, "Dr. White, what would you like for breakfast tomorrow? We've got fresh milk..."

"Just the usual is fine." Luna politely declined any special treatment.

Once the meal began, the three boys devoured the food like a whirlwind. Ryan Wallace kept his head down, shoveling rice into his mouth, while Luna Whitaker kept glancing around—several doctors in white coats were whispering and pointing in their direction.

"Is that the director's favorite?"
"Tch, bringing all these country bumpkins..."

The hushed remarks reached her ears, and suddenly, the chopsticks in her hand felt heavier.

Luna immediately noticed her sister's discomfort. She stood abruptly and walked over to the doctors' table.

"Colleagues," she said, her tone measured but firm, "this is my eldest sister. If you have any issues with the canteen food, you're welcome to take it up with Director Zhang."

The group fell silent instantly.

When Luna returned to her seat, she saw her sister's eyes were red-rimmed. "Ignore them, sis. Let's just enjoy our meal."

Just then, a commotion broke out at the canteen entrance. Andrew Smith strode in, carrying two bulging cloth bags.

"Perfect timing," he said with a grin, setting them on the table. "Brought some New Year's treats from home."

Inside were cured sausages, soy-braised duck, and a pack of milk candies. The children cheered, the earlier tension vanishing in an instant.

As they walked back after the meal, Luna Whitaker whispered, "Luna, that Mr. Smith... does he have feelings for you?"

Luna's ears burned before she could answer. Then she spotted Andrew's jeep parked outside the dormitory. He was unloading folding cots from the trunk, his military uniform sleeves rolled up to reveal toned forearms.

"Good timing," Andrew said, wiping sweat from his brow. "Sleeping on the floor in this weather would be freezing."

Four camp beds, four brand-new bedding sets. Watching the soldier bustle about, Luna Whitaker suddenly understood something and smiled knowingly.
###Chapter 276 Planning the Future

Luna handed Andrew the steaming lunchbox and quickly set out chopsticks with a small dish of vinegar. Andrew had picked up the local tastes from Six Paths Village—dumplings just didn't taste right without vinegar.

"Eat while it's hot. They won't be as good once they cool," she urged softly.

Andrew's eyes crinkled into happy crescents. Being cared for by his fiancée warmed his heart. Someone remembering your preferences—that was true happiness.

"Got it!" He dug in right there in the kitchen.

The mutton dumplings the canteen chef had saved for him were still piping hot. Dipped in aged vinegar, each bite was delicious.

In the living room, Luna was helping everyone set up camp beds. The spacious room easily accommodated four cots in a row. Samuel had already claimed his spot, marveling at the unfamiliar bedding—back home, they'd always slept on brick beds.

After finishing his meal, Andrew scrubbed the lunchbox until it shone. Rolling down his sleeves, he emerged to find the makeshift dormitory and chuckled.

"All settled? It's getting late—I'll head back now and pick you up at eight tomorrow to see the house." He checked his watch—already past eight.

Samuel was already snoring under the blankets. Andrew understood—these first-time travelers must be exhausted.

Luna nudged her sister. "Luna, walk Andrew out. Be careful—it's freezing out there." This was her future brother-in-law, after all.

As Luna reached for her coat, Andrew stopped her. "Don't bother—it's twenty below outside. Get some rest." He squeezed her hand. "See you tomorrow."

Only after hearing the car start downstairs did Luna turn from the balcony. The family had already succumbed to sleep, the children's synchronized snores drawing laughter from the adults.

"Lights out," Luna said, switching them off before joining her sister in the bedroom.

Half-asleep, Luna murmured, "Andrew...he's a good man..." before drifting off.

Luna smiled at the ceiling. "Mmm." Yes, he certainly was.

Dawn barely broke when Luna stirred—new places always disrupted her sleep. Luna rose too, and the sisters took their aluminum pot to the canteen.

Back home, millet porridge simmered on the gas stove. They'd bought meat buns, eggs, pickles, and two pounds of fried dough sticks—the three growing boys had hearty appetites.

By their return, Ryan had the children tidy the living room. The folding round table was set, and breakfast became a lively affair.

"Sis, now that you're here, we need to plan your next steps," Luna said, setting down her chopsticks. She had ideas but wanted her sister and brother-in-law's input.

Luna sighed. "My mind's still spinning. I thought we'd find work first—we're not afraid of hard labor."

Luna shook her head. Her sister was still thinking the old way.

Ryan's eyes lit up. "Luna, I've been considering starting a small business. Back when I raised pigs, I saw many build fortunes this way." Having traveled the village, his mind worked differently.

"Exactly!" Luna's eyes sparkled. "The cold weather here is perfect for food service. Tonight I'll cook something special—we'll invite Andrew to taste it. If my recipe works, that's our business!"

In her past life after escaping, she'd worked at a hot pot restaurant. The trend hadn't caught on here yet—perfect timing. Cold weather guaranteed customers.

"Would...that work?" Luna hesitated.

"We'll find out by trying," Luna said confidently. "Andrew's traveled widely—he can help evaluate it too."

Ryan slapped his thigh. "Deal! We'll test it tonight!"

Seeing her sister's shining eyes, Luna finally nodded. "We'll follow your lead."

Luna smiled. She was determined to give her sister a better life. A hot pot business would be the perfect beginning.
###Chapter 277: Not Satisfied

After lunch, Andrew arrived right on time. The adults decided not to bring the three children along—it was freezing outside, and the kids wouldn’t be much help. In the end, only the four adults set out.

Luna, worried the children might get bored, turned on the TV. A rerun of the Spring Festival Gala was playing, occasionally interrupted by drama episodes. The three kids were immediately captivated by the moving images in the small box.

Andrew drove them to their destination, which took about half an hour. Luna surveyed the surroundings—rows of single-story houses, neatly arranged like military barracks. Though modest, the close-knit buildings retained warmth surprisingly well.

Andrew pulled out a key and unlocked one of the doors. Despite the lack of heating, the interior was comfortably warm. The space consisted of three large rooms, with the middle one dimly lit but spacious. Each room could easily fit two beds and some cabinets.

"This belongs to Captain Lian’s family," Andrew explained as he showed them around. "His parents moved in with his older brother and wanted to rent it out for extra income. Fifteen dollars a month, utilities not included. The furniture comes with it—just don’t damage anything. There’s also a small kitchen outside."

Luna and Ryan exchanged glances. It wasn’t as spacious as their home in the village, but finding such a place in the city was already a stroke of luck.

"Captain Andrew, about the rent..." Luna hesitated, mentally calculating. Fifteen dollars could buy a hundred eggs back in the village.

"Luna," Andrew cut in gently, "let’s check out the neighborhood first. Renting isn’t just about comfort—it’s also about whether the location suits your business plans."

Luna fell silent. She had to admit her younger sister had more experience in such matters.

Ryan nodded in agreement. His sister-in-law had lived in the city longer and had a better grasp of things.

The four of them headed to the commercial district. Despite it being mid-morning, the streets were already bustling. Luna observed the foot traffic, her mind working. This area was ideal for fast food, but a hot pot restaurant might not fit. People came here to shop—who’d want to splurge on a leisurely hot pot meal?

A thought crossed her mind: maybe her sister should start with something simpler, like spicy skewers. But one look at the icy streets made her dismiss the idea. Making money was important, but not at the expense of her sister and brother-in-law suffering in the cold.

"Not satisfied?" Andrew noticed her hesitation.

Luna voiced her concerns. "Ideally, we’d want a street-facing shop with space for ten tables and a roomy kitchen. If there’s living quarters attached, even better—it’d save us the commute."

Andrew thought for a moment. "Don’t worry, it’s only the sixth day of the new year. Many shops haven’t reopened yet. I’ll ask around these next couple of days."

Luna smiled sheepishly. "I’m being too impatient. Let’s head back—I’ll make hot pot for everyone!" They’d been out all morning and hadn’t even stopped for lunch.

Andrew’s eyes lit up. "There’s a big market up ahead—it should be open today. Let’s grab ingredients. I’m curious about this hot pot you keep mentioning."

Back at the dormitory, Luna’s sister eyed the mountain of groceries but held her tongue. She didn’t want to embarrass Luna in front of Andrew.

The three children eagerly helped carry the bags inside. Luna and her sister shed their coats and dove into the kitchen.

"Andrew," Luna called out, "could you find us an electric stove?"

Without a word, Andrew threw on his coat and left.

The sisters worked in tandem—Luna’s sister washed and prepped the vegetables while Luna stir-fried the hot pot base. The pungent, spicy aroma made them cough, and even the kids in the living room noticed. Luna hurried to open a window, letting in a gust of icy wind—still better than suffocating on chili fumes.

Once everything was ready, Luna sliced the rock-hard frozen lamb into thin pieces. The freezing weather had its perks—no need for a fridge when anything left outside turned solid in minutes, perfect for making lamb rolls.
###Chapter 278: A Perfect Match

Andrew Smith burst through the door with his usual energy, lugging a massive electric stove—an uncommon sight in the area. Not only did it guzzle electricity, but it was also a fire hazard. Still, they had no other choice.

Surprisingly, he wasn’t alone. Behind him trailed a small group: Robert Thompson led the way, followed by a kind-faced woman pushing a wheelchair-bound soldier, with a little girl sporting pigtails skipping alongside.

Luna White was busy in the kitchen, completely unaware of the new arrivals.

The moment the stove was plugged in and the clay pot placed on top, steam billowed upward. Luna had already prepared the broth, and the meatballs were perfectly thawed. Though the cold weather made fresh vegetables scarce, she had gathered cabbage, potatoes, frozen tofu, glass noodles, and tofu skin. There were also rehydrated mushrooms, wood ear fungus, lamb slices, meatballs, and crispy fried pork—enough to cover the entire table.

The homemade sesame sauce was fragrant, accompanied by small dishes of fermented leek flower paste, preserved tofu, finely chopped scallions, and pickled garlic. The star of the show was the chili sauce, brought by Luna’s sister from their hometown—garlicky, spicy, and utterly addictive.

Luna emerged with the final dish and finally took in the guests. She recognized Robert from the clinic. As for the other three, she guessed the little girl was the child she’d rescued earlier.

"Happy New Year! Please, have a seat," Luna greeted warmly. "Andrew, bring out the liquor—you men can have a drink."

Andrew grinned, delighted at being ordered around by his wife. To him, it was proof she saw him as family.

Robert shook his head in amusement. Since when had his old friend become so whipped after marriage?

Twelve people crowded around the large round table—the men clustered at one end with their drinks, while the women and children sat on the other side. As Luna moved to take her seat, she realized the only spot left was between Andrew and her sister.

"Come here," Andrew beckoned. "We’ve been waiting for you."

The moment she sat down, her glass was filled with orange juice—a rare treat in those days.

"First, a toast to the New Year!" Luna raised her glass. "Then, try the hot pot and let me know what you think. My sister’s thinking of opening a restaurant."

Robert took one bite and froze. "Dr. White, this is incredible!" He’d expected a simple stew, but the numbing spice and rich aroma blew him away.

Ryan Wallace and Andrew abandoned their drinks, chopsticks flying. Even the wheelchair-bound soldier, Ethan, didn’t hold back on the spice. Luna soon learned his family was from Hunan—even little NiuNiu, smeared with chili oil, kept begging for more meatballs.

"Sis, see?" Luna explained as she swirled lamb slices in the broth. "Hot pot is all about the atmosphere. Friends gathered around one pot, cooking whatever they like. Today’s just the spicy version, but we could also do a split pot for those who can’t handle heat."

Ryan’s eyes lit up, and he slammed the table. "Open it! You have to open this place!"

Luna’s sister smiled. "My little sister always has ideas—even cooking turns into a business opportunity."

By the end of the meal, the decision was made. The steaming hot pot hadn’t just cooked delicious ingredients—it had brewed the beginnings of a thriving new venture.

###Chapter 279: A Delicate Hint

Mrs. Wu held a teacup in both hands, her eyes red-rimmed as she gazed at Luna. "Dr. White, we swallowed our pride and came with Instructor Smith just to thank you in person. If you hadn’t saved our little Nini, my husband and I wouldn’t have been able to go on living." Her voice trembled, fingers shaking as she recalled the day her daughter had fallen ill.

Luna quickly clasped Mrs. Wu’s hands. "Please don’t say that. I’m a doctor—saving lives is my duty. I would’ve done the same for anyone in that situation."

Nini stood on tiptoe, straining to reach the slices of lamb in the hot pot, her little face flushed with effort. Mrs. Wu swatted her hand away. "You greedy little thing, you’ll burn yourself!"

"Mean Mommy!" Nini pouted, tears welling in her eyes.

Luna chuckled and piled a generous portion of lamb into the girl’s bowl. "Here, sweetheart. Eat slowly—I’ll help you."

Instantly cheered, the little girl dug in with gusto. Jiao Yang watched his daughter, his heart aching. He subtly wheeled his chair back, trying to hide his paralyzed legs from view.

"Jiao, what kind of work do you do now?" Luna asked suddenly.

His face stiffened. "I... make paper boxes at home," he muttered, lowering his head as if wishing the ground would swallow him.

Mrs. Wu jumped in. "He’s got real talent! His boxes are sturdier than the factory-made ones!" She pulled a few neatly crafted boxes from her bag. "See, Dr. White? He made these."

Luna examined them closely, her eyes lighting up. "Jiao, with skills like these, you could open a small shop! The university district is always short on gift packaging—students would love these."

Jiao’s head snapped up, hope flickering in his eyes before dimming again. "But with my condition..."

"Your legs may not work, but your hands are perfectly fine," Luna cut in. "And with Mrs. Wu’s help, I’m sure you’d succeed!"

Nini suddenly raised her greasy little hand. "Daddy’s the best! His boxes can hold soooo many candies!"

Everyone laughed. Under his wife and daughter’s hopeful gazes, Jiao finally gave a firm nod.

As they prepared to leave, Mrs. Wu insisted on pressing a bag of red dates into Luna’s hands. Unable to refuse, Luna quietly signaled Andrew to slip the New Year’s provisions he’d prepared into their belongings.

Andrew caught her meaning. While helping lift the wheelchair, he discreetly tucked the package into the storage compartment beneath. Their eyes met, sharing a silent understanding.

"Bye, Dr. Luna!" Nini waved vigorously from her mother’s arms.

After seeing the family off, Luna exhaled deeply. Andrew wrapped his arms around her waist from behind. "Playing matchmaker and guardian angel—tired?"

She leaned into his embrace. "Every little bit helps. Seeing them... reminds me of my past self."

Night deepened, their shadows merging under the streetlamp, stretching long across the pavement.
###Chapter 280: Sisterly Bond

Luna and Maya White squeezed into the kitchen to clean the dishes. Maya snatched a bowl from her sister's hands. "Don't touch cold water!" She remembered Luna had always been sensitive to the cold since childhood.

"Come on!" Luna chuckled and turned to boil a large pot of water. Steam rose as she poured it into the sink. Maya scolded her for wasting gas but quickly got to work washing the dishes. Luna stood nearby, carefully drying each one with a towel.

"Luna," Maya suddenly stopped, her gaze firm. "I've decided—I'm going to start that hotpot business." She knew her sister was pointing her toward a brighter path.

Luna's eyes lit up. "That's perfect!" She counted on her fingers. "You and Ryan need to find a storefront these next couple of days, and you'll have to learn how to make the broth base. The base can be frozen, but the key is mastering the technique..."

"But the startup funds..." Maya dried her hands, her brow furrowed.

"Hey!" Luna grabbed her sister's hand. "I still have that 10,000-yuan thank-you gift from a patient's family. Take it." When Maya tried to refuse, Luna quickly added, "Consider it a loan—with interest! If you can't pay me back, the shop's mine."

Maya's eyes grew misty as she lightly tapped her sister's hand. "You little..."

"Money's just money," Luna leaned against her sister's shoulder. "Between us, there's no need for formalities. You're starting a business—who else is going to help you if I don't?"

Ryan Wallace poked his head into the kitchen from the living room. "Luna, we really owe you this time—"

"Ryan!" Luna pretended to scold. "We're family—no need for polite talk. The moment you walked away from everything for my sister, I knew you were the right man for her."

Ryan scratched his head sheepishly, but Maya suddenly had an idea. "Luna, why don't you run the business? I'll work for you."

"No way!" Luna waved her hands. "Hospital rules—doctors can't run side businesses. Don't make me lose my job!"

Maya panicked. "Then I'll do it! We'll split the profits."

"Sis~" Luna dragged out the word. "When you're rich, would you ever forget me? Right now, you and Ryan focus on finding a location. I'll handle the ideas. You provide the labor, I provide the brains—that's teamwork!"

Ryan laughed. "We've got the muscle, but when it comes to brains, ten of me couldn't match our Luna."

"Ryan!" Luna stomped her foot. "Keep sweet-talking like that, and I'll tell Maya!"

Maya immediately defended her husband. "He's an honest man!"

"Wow~" Luna clutched her chest dramatically. "It hasn't even been that long, and you're already taking his side!"

"You brat!" Maya playfully raised a hand, and Luna shrieked, darting into the bedroom. Ryan egged her on from behind. "Go get her, honey!"

The three kids joined in. "Go, Mom! Go, Aunt Luna!"

Maya's eyes sparkled as she called out, "Luna, come out! Let's show them what sisters can do!"

Luna bounded back, rolling up her sleeves. "You handle Ryan—I'll take care of the kids!"

The sisters struck simultaneously. Luna pinned the three nephews on the couch, tickling them until they squealed with laughter. Meanwhile, Maya and Ryan playfully wrestled, their eyes full of affection. Luna covered her eyes and fled back to the bedroom. "I can't watch this!"

Laughter echoed through the house, inside and out, lingering long after.
###Chapter 281: All Set

The morning sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains as Luna White rubbed her eyes. It was her first day back at work after the New Year.

"Sis, Ryan, I'm heading to the hospital," she said, fastening the buttons on her white coat. "Finding a storefront is up to you now. Just follow the criteria I wrote down."

Luna's sister and brother-in-law nodded eagerly, clutching the note filled with detailed instructions. They had stayed up late the night before, memorizing every word to avoid any mistakes.

The hospital smelled of disinfectant. Luna carried two jars of honey straight to the director's office.

"Director Zhang, Happy New Year!" She smiled, handing over the gift. "This is raw honey from my hometown—great for digestion."

The elderly director adjusted his glasses, his wrinkles softening with a smile. "Luna, you're always so thoughtful."

After exchanging pleasantries, Luna brought up Samuel's schooling. Without hesitation, Director Zhang agreed, "Leave it to me. I'll have it sorted by the day after tomorrow."

Leaving his office, Luna stopped by her supervisor David Moore's room. He was sipping tea while reading the newspaper but set it aside when she entered.

"Director Moore, Happy New Year." She placed a small bag of walnuts on his desk. "I heard you've been working late. These are good for the brain."

David chuckled, his eyes crinkling. "Luna, you’re such a considerate girl." He tapped the commendation banner on his desk. "That banner from Andrew’s family really brought honor to our department."

At three in the afternoon, Luna’s phone rang. It was Director Zhang. "Luna, it’s done. Just pick up the paperwork from HR tomorrow."

Holding the phone, Luna felt her eyes grow warm. Since her reincarnation, she had met so many kind people.

Meanwhile, Luna’s sister and brother-in-law were scouring the city. Following the map Luna had drawn, they checked storefront after storefront, their legs aching from walking, but nothing seemed right.

On the twentieth day of the lunar month, they finally found a two-story building near the university district. The landlord, a shrewd middle-aged man with a cigarette dangling from his lips, stated, "Three thousand a year. Not a penny less."

Luna’s sister gasped. That was half a year’s salary for her!

That evening, Luna rushed over after work. After inspecting the place, her eyes lit up. "Sis, this is perfect! We can fit over twenty tables upstairs and downstairs."

Ryan rubbed his hands nervously. "But the rent..."

"Worth it!" Luna said firmly. "University students love group meals, and journalists and TV crews are always networking. With good food, business will thrive."

The day after signing the ten-year lease, Ryan rode his new tricycle to the market, followed by sixteen-year-old Ethan, who carried Luna’s shopping list.

"Uncle, pick the lamb with even marbling," the tall teenager advised knowledgeably.

In the kitchen, Luna taught Ethan how to prepare the broth base. The boy learned quickly—by his third attempt, the flavor impressed her.

"Ethan, you're a natural chef!" Luna gave him a thumbs-up.

Ethan smiled shyly, flecks of chili powder on his forehead. Glancing at his parents wiping down tables, he noticed the first strands of gray in their hair.

"Aunt Luna, I’ll make this hotpot restaurant succeed," he said solemnly.

She ruffled his hair. "I believe in you."

By late February, the restaurant was fully renovated. Copper pots, gas tanks, and custom-made tables and chairs were all in place. Standing at the entrance, Luna gazed at the new sign—"White Family Hotpot"—her lips curving into a smile.

Samuel came running from school, his cheeks flushed. "Aunt Luna! My classmates all said they’re coming to try the hotpot!"

Luna crouched to straighten his crooked red scarf. "Then your brother better show off his skills."

As the setting sun cast golden light over the newly laid tiles, the family stood at the doorway, their faces a mix of excitement and nervousness.

Tomorrow, their new venture would officially begin.
###Chapter 282: Grand Opening

The first day of March carried a lingering winter chill with hints of warmth. The White Family Spicy Hotpot had chosen this auspicious day—the traditional "Dragon Raises Head" festival—for its grand opening.

A brand-new red-and-gold sign hung prominently above the entrance. Luna White and her husband Ryan Wallace stood by the door, both excited and nervous. They had prepared tirelessly for this moment.

"Luna, do you think this will work?" Luna fidgeted with her hands, her eyes darting toward the street. She had deliberately worn a red coat for good luck.

Her younger sister, Luna, patted her hand reassuringly. "Relax, sis. Our secret spice blend is one-of-a-kind. Customers will come back for more."

To attract customers, Luna had come up with an idea—printing flyers. Full-color printing was too expensive, so they settled for black-and-white ones with enticing slogans like "Spicy, fragrant, unforgettable!" Ryan, along with Ethan and Aaron Jackson, had slipped them under doors before dawn.

The restaurant had hired two waitstaff, but with family pitching in, they managed. Ethan handled the spice preparation in the kitchen, while Ryan and the kitchen assistants washed and plated vegetables. Luna took charge of the cash register, while Aaron and the waitstaff attended to the front.

"Firecrackers!" Ethan shouted as he and Aaron lit two strings of firecrackers. The loud pops drew curious onlookers.

Yet, by noon, the restaurant remained empty. Luna twisted the edge of her apron anxiously. "What do we do now?"

Luna was considering calling Andrew Smith for help when a thunderous drumbeat echoed in the distance.

"What's that?" Ryan peered outside.

A procession of drummers in bright red costumes marched toward them, followed by ten sharply dressed young men carrying exquisite flower baskets.

"Mr. Andrew Smith congratulates the White Family Spicy Hotpot on its grand opening!" Their synchronized greeting turned heads.

Luna’s heart warmed. This man always knew how to make things perfect.

Before they could recover, another delivery arrived. "Mr. Robert Thompson wishes the White Family prosperity and success!"

Seizing the moment, Luna announced loudly, "For our opening month, all dishes are 10% off!"

The announcement worked—several hesitant passersby stepped inside. Ryan hurried to greet them while Luna explained the menu. The kitchen soon buzzed with activity.

Just as they breathed a sigh of relief, a truck screeched to a halt outside. A dozen workers unloaded potted plants—money trees, cycads, and even rare orchids, each tied with a red ribbon.

"Who sent these?" Ryan stopped one of the workers.

The man wiped his brow. "A Mr. Yu ordered them as a gift for Dr. White."

Luna froze. Mr. Yu? She didn’t know anyone by that name...


###Chapter 283: Drinking in Her Stead

"Good afternoon. This is a congratulatory gift from Mr. Jacob Jiang of the Jiang Corporation for the grand opening of the Bai Family Spicy Hot Pot. Mr. Jiang has reserved ten tables for ten people each, arriving at 8 PM sharp. Should we pay a deposit in advance?" The bespectacled man spoke with impeccable politeness.

Luna White finally recognized him—wasn't this the assistant who had driven her home last time?

Ryan Wallace was stunned. Ten tables? Ten seats per table? How many people was that?

Luna nudged him discreetly, and Ryan snapped out of it. "No deposit needed. We'll have everything prepared for Mr. Jiang's arrival." He knew how to handle formalities smoothly.

The assistant turned to Luna, his face lighting up with a respectful, almost deferential smile. "Dr. White, Mr. Jiang sent me specifically to congratulate you on your family's new venture. I hope you don't mind."

Luna smiled faintly. "How thoughtful of Mr. Jiang. I’m delighted. Please convey my gratitude and let him know I’ll visit him personally to thank him soon." If someone was offering goodwill, why refuse?

"Of course." The assistant directed the workers to arrange the expensive floral displays neatly before taking his leave.

Luna's sister pulled her aside and whispered, "Who is this Mr. Jiang? Such extravagance! Those plants must’ve cost a fortune." Having recently dealt with decorators, she knew even an ordinary orchid could cost hundreds, let alone rare varieties.

Luna patted her sister’s hand reassuringly. "Don’t worry. He’s the grandson of the elderly gentleman I saved last winter. This is his way of repaying the favor." She understood Jacob Jiang was extending an olive branch—one that might prove useful later.

Her sister relaxed and went back to attending other guests.

At half past noon, Andrew Smith arrived with twenty of his casually dressed comrades. Though out of uniform, their upright posture and synchronized steps betrayed their military discipline.

Luna’s sister hurried to greet them. The ten tables on the first floor, which had only been partially occupied, were now nearly full. She silently thanked her sister for insisting on a spacious layout—otherwise, they’d never have fit everyone.

"Andrew, thank you so much." She handed him the menu, her approval of her future brother-in-law growing.

Andrew passed it around with a grin. "No need for thanks, we’re family. These are my comrades. When they heard my fiancée’s sister was opening a restaurant, they insisted on coming to support."

"Yeah, sis! Bring out the good stuff—we’re all carnivores!" a few of them chimed in.

She nodded with a smile. "I’ll arrange it. Anybody who doesn’t eat spicy?"

A couple raised their hands, and she noted it before heading to prepare the broth.

Luna carried over four bottles of Maotai, placing two on each table. Andrew quickly took them from her, murmuring, "Come meet my comrades. They’re straightforward—don’t mind their bluntness."

Luna nodded graciously. If she was committing to Andrew, she’d have to get to know his circle sooner or later.

She poured herself a full glass and stood between the two tables. "Hello, everyone. I’m Luna White, Andrew’s fiancée. Thank you all for coming. This toast is for you." She downed it in one go.

Cheers and applause erupted.

The man beside Andrew, Simon, clapped him on the back. "Damn, Andrew! Not only is your girl stunning, but she’s got guts too—puts our wives to shame!" He turned to the others. "Shouldn’t we punish the captain here with three drinks for hiding such a gem?"

"Three drinks! Three drinks!" The group roared in agreement.

Andrew shot Simon a glare—the man thrived on chaos. But he downed three shots without hesitation.

Luna’s heart ached. Drinking on an empty stomach was terrible for him. Thankfully, her sister had Ryan bring out peanuts and pickles.

Simon wasn’t done. "Comrades! The captain took three. Since it’s our first time meeting Luna, shouldn’t we each drink six to match her three? But we can’t bully a lady, so we’ll drink double!"

Luna nearly laughed. These soldiers were nothing if not earnest—even their drinking games came with multipliers. But her tolerance was abysmal; two ounces would knock her out.

Just as she hesitated, Andrew snatched her glass. "I’ll drink for her. She’s no match for you alcohol tanks." He downed three more in quick succession.

The room erupted in laughter, teasing Andrew for spoiling his fiancée. Luna squeezed his hand discreetly before slipping away to help her sister with the dishes.
###Chapter 284: Dean Zhang's Support

The midday sun streamed through the glass windows, casting warm light across the restaurant. Luna White and Ryan Wallace bustled about, attending to new customers with barely concealed delight. Though only three tables were occupied, each had spent thirty to fifty dollars—already over a hundred in revenue by noon. If business doubled by evening, today's earnings would be secure.

"Sis, look over there!" Luna suddenly tugged at her sister's sleeve.

A group of hospital administrators filed in, led by none other than Dean Zhang. Behind him trailed department heads, including Dr. Li Ran, who rarely interacted with Luna. Her pulse quickened as she hurried to greet them.

"Dean Zhang, what brings you here in person?" Luna beamed, her eyes crinkling with warmth.

Dean Zhang feigned offense. "What, is my old face not welcome here?" He glanced around. "I heard your sister opened a hotpot place, so I brought everyone to show support."

Ryan immediately stepped forward to assist while Luna handed over the menu. Dean Zhang waved it off. "No need—just bring us your specialties!" He turned to the group. "Today, eat to your heart's content. Anyone who holds back will answer to me!"

Luna's chest swelled with gratitude. This was Dean Zhang publicly endorsing her. Everyone in the hospital knew: those he personally took out to dine were the ones he valued most.

When the split hotpot arrived, the group marveled. Dean Zhang dipped a slice of lamb into the spicy broth, his eyes lighting up. "This flavor is incredible!" The others echoed his praise.

After the meal, Luna went to settle the bill, only to learn Dean Zhang had already paid. Her eyes stung slightly—she wouldn't forget this kindness.

By evening, Luna left work early and hurried to the restaurant. The rich aroma of hotpot greeted her from a distance, and every table was full. To her surprise, the lunchtime customers had even brought friends.

"Luna," her sister whispered conspiratorially, "Mr. Jiang is upstairs. He asked about you."

Her heart skipped. Smoothing her collar, she ascended to find Jared Jiang chatting animatedly with two young men. He stood the moment he saw her.

"Dr. White, we meet again." His lips curved, eyes glinting like starlight.

Luna steadied herself. "Mr. Jiang gracing us with your presence truly honors our humble establishment."

He chuckled. "The honor is mine. This authentic hotpot is a privilege to experience." His gaze burned. "Might I have the pleasure of your company for dinner?"

Her ears flushed. This man—he was trouble.
###Chapter 285: A Fateful Encounter

"Dr. White, you're too kind." Jiang Shaoqing lifted his teacup, his slender fingers tracing the rim. "You saved my grandfather last time. The Jiang family won’t forget this debt. Having my assistant keep an eye on your affairs was simply to ensure you don’t run into trouble."

His gaze was gentle, yet laced with unyielding authority.

Luna took a sip of tea, the delicate flavor lingering on her tongue. She met his eyes, her lips curving into a faint smile. "Mr. Jiang, saving lives is a doctor’s duty. Your concern only makes me feel burdened."

"Hah, acting all noble now?" A derisive chuckle cut through the air.

Luna finally noticed the man seated beside Jiang Shaoqing. The moment she recognized his face, her fingers twitched, nearly spilling the tea.

Fate truly has a cruel sense of humor.

It was Shang Kaijie—Shang Kaiwen’s older brother. The same man who had helped his sister orchestrate her death in her past life.

"Whether I deserve it or not isn’t for you to decide," Luna set her cup down with a sharp clink.

Jiang Shaoqing frowned. The Luna he knew was always composed—this was the first time he’d seen her so openly confrontational.

Shang Kaijie slammed his hands on the table and shot to his feet. "Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you speak to me like that!" He jabbed a finger at her face. "I could ruin your career in the medical field with one word!"

The restaurant fell silent. Every eye was fixed on the unfolding drama.

Luna calmly wiped her hands, a cold smirk playing on her lips. "The Shang family sure loves throwing their weight around. What’s next? Following your sister’s example and stealing someone else’s fiancé?"

Shang Kaijie’s face darkened instantly.

"You’re dead!" He raised a fist, ready to strike.

"Enough!" Jiang Shaoqing’s voice cracked like a whip as he seized Shang Kaijie’s wrist. "She’s my guest."

Shang Kaijie struggled, but Jiang Shaoqing’s grip was unbreakable. His face flushed red. "Jiang-ge, this woman—"

"Apologize," Jiang Shaoqing said coldly. "Or don’t bother showing your face around me again."

A young man nearby quickly intervened. "Dr. White, Kaijie’s just hot-headed. Please don’t take it to heart."

Luna watched Shang Kaijie’s stifled rage with satisfaction. He hadn’t looked nearly this miserable when he’d helped Shang Kaiwen destroy her in her past life.

"Why should I forgive him?" she asked leisurely. "Because he’s a Shang?"

Shang Kaijie trembled with fury. "You’re pushing your luck!"

"Shang Kaijie!" Jiang Shaoqing’s voice turned icy. "Get out."

The words hit like a bucket of cold water. Shang Kaijie stared at him in disbelief. "For her?"

Jiang Shaoqing was already dialing his phone. "Security. There’s a disturbance on the third floor."

Shang Kaijie’s face cycled through shades of red and white before he finally shot Luna a venomous glare. "This isn’t over!" He stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

The restaurant remained deathly quiet. Everyone stared at the woman who’d just made Jiang Shaoqing turn against his own associate.

Luna, however, acted as if nothing had happened. She picked up her teacup again. Though the tea had gone cold, she’d never felt more satisfied.

The debts from my past life will be repaid—one by one.

And today was only the beginning.
###Chapter 286: Provoking the Wrong Person

A vicious glint flashed in Shang Kaijie's eyes as his fist shot toward Luna White's face with a whoosh of air. Having trained at a boxing club for three years, he knew this punch would leave the woman disfigured.

Luna stood motionless, a cold smirk curling her lips.

"Looking to die?" Jiang Shaoqing roared, leaping into action. He knew Shang Kaijie's capabilities all too well—this strike was clearly meant to be lethal.

At the critical moment, a dark figure darted out from the stairwell like lightning. Andrew Smith executed a flawless flip, shielding Luna securely in his arms and taking the full force of the blow on his back.

A dull thud echoed as Shang Kaijie's fist connected solidly with Andrew's spine. Simultaneously, Jiang Shaoqing's flying kick landed, sending Shang Kaijie sprawling backward.

"Cough... cough..." Shang Kaijie slammed into the wall, clutching his chest as he hacked violently.

Luna looked up into Andrew's worried gaze and murmured, "I'm fine." She discreetly loosened her grip on the silver needle hidden in her palm. What a pity—had Andrew not intervened, she could have ensured Shang Kaijie would never be a man again.

In her past life, she had witnessed the girls Shang Kaijie had ruined. This time, she wouldn't let history repeat itself.

"Step back," Andrew said, his voice low but his eyes icy.

Luna caught his wrist. "Don't—"

"Relax." He pried her fingers open one by one. "Dealing with him doesn't require breaking protocol."

Jiang Shaoqing had already rolled up his sleeves, revealing muscular forearms. "Leave this to me, Andrew. Dr. White is my family's benefactor. If anything happens to her under my watch, I owe an explanation."

Andrew lit a cigarette and took a deep drag. "Thirty seconds."

"Twenty." Jiang Shaoqing cracked his neck. "If you can still recognize him as human afterward, I lose."

Shang Kaijie finally recognized who he was facing, his face turning ashen. Andrew was infamous in the military compound—the undisputed "king" of brawls since childhood, now an elite special forces soldier.

"Brother Jiang! For my sister's sake—" Shang Kaijie's plea was cut short by Jiang Shaoqing's fist smashing into his face.

Andrew exhaled smoke lazily, counting down. "Ten, nine, eight..."

This was the first time Luna had seen Andrew like this—leaning against the wall, a hint of roguishness in the haze of smoke, a far cry from the stern officer she knew.

Noticing her gaze, Andrew turned his head. Their eyes met, and for a fleeting moment, warmth flickered in his gaze, as if to say: Don't be afraid. I'm here.

"Time's up." Jiang Shaoqing shook blood off his knuckles. "Kid's got tough bones."

Shang Kaijie lay crumpled on the ground, his face swollen like a pig's, but only superficial wounds marked him. Jiang Shaoqing had held back—enough to teach a lesson without causing serious trouble.

Andrew loomed over Shang Kaijie. "Remember this: Luna is my fiancée." He bent down, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Lay a finger on her again, and I'll have your entire family carrying you here to apologize."

Shang Kaijie's pupils constricted. He finally understood why Jiang Shaoqing had stepped in—and that he'd kicked a steel plate.

"Let's go." Andrew took Luna's hand and strode away without a backward glance.

Shang Kaijie glared at their retreating figures, resentment burning in his eyes. Luna White, was it? This debt, I'll remember.
###Chapter 287: Repaying Kindness

Andrew Smith pulled Luna White into her seat and sat close beside her. Kevin Shang had already been dragged away by security—someone would make sure he got home "safely."

Jason Jiang wiped blood from his hands, offering Luna an apologetic smile. "Dr. White, my deepest apologies for that unpleasant scene. I didn’t expect someone to have such a violent outburst. I hope you weren’t frightened."

"Mr. Jiang, the trouble was mine to bear," Luna replied, a sharp glint in her eyes. "If Kevin Shang wants revenge, he can come at me directly."

She wasn’t bluffing. The timid young doctor she once was no longer existed. Kevin’s petty schemes meant nothing to her now.

This was 1986—a society governed by law. At worst, Kevin could only use his family’s influence to make her work life difficult. But she trusted Dean Thompson’s integrity. And besides...

Her gaze flickered toward Andrew. The prestige surrounding her fiancé shone brighter than ever.

A self-deprecating smile tugged at her lips. Since when did I become so calculating?

"You flatter me, Dr. White," Jason said solemnly. "The Jiang family honors its promises. My grandfather declared you our benefactor. As long as it doesn’t violate morality, the Jiangs will stand by you."

It was both a vow and an investment. They understood Luna’s value better than anyone.

"My woman doesn’t need your protection," Andrew declared, draping an arm over the back of Luna’s chair in a possessive gesture. "If that bastard shows his face again, I’ll make sure he regrets it."

Jason poured wine with a wry chuckle. "Relax, Andrew. Let me handle the Shangs. I’ll speak to Old Man Shang—Kevin won’t bother Dr. White again." He smirked. "Look at you, guarding her like a prized possession. She’ll have her hands full once you’re married."

Only then did Luna realize how close the two men were.

Meanwhile, Luna’s sister, Luna Whitaker, and her brother-in-law, Ryan Wallace, paled when they saw a bloodied man being escorted downstairs. A brawl on opening night? They rushed upstairs, only to find Luna seated calmly beside Andrew and exhaled in relief.

"Don’t worry, Major Smith is here," Luna Whitaker told Ryan, pulling him back downstairs. "That guy probably had too much to drink and took a bad fall."

No sooner had they returned to the dining area than another group arrived—eight middle-aged men in official uniforms.

"Welcome!" Ryan greeted warmly. "All dishes are 10% off for our grand opening."

The lead official smiled. "You must be Dr. White’s brother-in-law?"

Ryan blinked. Another one here for Luna?

"Dr. White saved my life!" the man declared, thumping his chest. "Of course we’d support family!"

William Han chimed in, "Is Dr. White here? We need to thank her in person. I wouldn’t be alive if not for her."

Ryan suppressed a whistle. His sister-in-law’s connections were impressive.

"Don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever need anything," the officials assured them. "Within reason and the law, of course."

Luna Whitaker stood stunned. When did my little sister get to know so many important people?

The kitchen’s rich aromas wafted through the bustling dining area. Luna Whitaker and Ryan exchanged glances, hope flickering in their eyes.

This business just might work.
###Chapter 288: Familiar Faces

"I'm Luna's brother-in-law. I'll go call her down." Ryan Wallace hurried upstairs, his steps noticeably quicker than usual.

Aaron Jackson crouched beside Luna, whispering, "Auntie, someone's asking for you downstairs. Looks like a high-ranking official."

Andrew Smith frowned slightly. "Who is it?" His gaze turned wary as it swept toward the staircase. Nathaniel had just been dealt with—was he causing trouble again?

"Said he's your savior, Auntie. An older gentleman." Aaron scratched his head. "Oh, and he brought bodyguards."

Luna's eyes lit up. "It must be General Douglas!" She turned to Andrew. "He was in that car accident when I came to the city last time. I happened to save him."

Andrew's expression shifted. "Douglas?"

"You know him?" Luna was surprised, though it made sense—Andrew's father moved in the same circles.

"Likely one of my father's comrades." Andrew stood. "I'll go down with you."

Nathaniel set down his chopsticks. "Me too." He straightened his collar. "Uncle Douglas and my grandfather go way back."

For a moment, Luna felt dazed. In her past life, she'd never had the chance to meet people of this stature, let alone have them visit her. This life truly was different.

At the stairwell landing, Andrew noticed Luna hesitate. He subtly closed the distance, ready to steady her if needed. She always acted so strong, but to him, she'd always be the girl who needed protecting.

"General! What brings you here?" Luna hurried forward.

Douglas laughed heartily. "Dr. White, you opened your practice without even telling me!"

He was about to tease her further when he spotted the two men behind her. His eyes brightened. "Andrew Smith? Nathaniel Turner? What are you two doing here?"

"Good to see you, Uncle," they said in unison.

Douglas clapped Andrew on the shoulder. "You rascal, transferred here without a word!" He turned to Nathaniel. "How's the old man? I sent my boy to pay respects last Spring Festival—said he was in good spirits."

Luna quickly arranged extra seating. Nathaniel explained, "Grandfather was critically ill recently. Dr. White saved him. I came specifically to thank her."

Douglas looked at Luna in astonishment. "Well, I'll be! You saved Old Man Turner too?" He started counting on his fingers. "Him, me, and..."

"And Director Zhang," Andrew supplied smoothly.

Douglas roared with laughter. "Dr. White, with backing like this, you could walk sideways through this city and no one would dare stop you!"

Luna smiled faintly. "You flatter me, General. I only know how to heal, not throw my weight around."

"Good answer!" Douglas slapped the table. "That's what I like about you." His gaze flicked to where Luna sat beside Andrew, and he raised an eyebrow. "Andrew, why so far apart? Unless..."

Andrew's ears turned pink, but before he could respond, Luna stood gracefully. "Uncle Douglas, let me check your pulse while you're here. A follow-up would be good."

The diversion made everyone laugh. Harold Baker shook his head at Luna. "This girl's got a talent for changing subjects."

The room filled with cheerful banter. Luna stole a glance at Andrew, finding his warm gaze already on her. Her heart softened. Yes, this life was entirely different.
###Chapter 289: Sudden Misfortune

Andrew Smith's lips curled into a faint smirk. It seemed the Li family patriarch was still in the dark.

"Uncle Li, perhaps you're unaware?" he deliberately raised his voice. "Dr. White is Andrew's fiancée! Of course, the lovebirds would sit together."

The private room fell into stunned silence.

Andrew suppressed a triumphant grin. He'd done his homework on Luna White and knew about the Smith family's influence behind her. What puzzled him was how the Smiths seemed completely oblivious to this engagement.

The Smith family dynamics were far more complicated than most. Andrew's stepmother, Victoria Smith, was a formidable woman. His grandfather had once remarked how she'd managed to wrap Andrew's father around her finger without bearing any children, securing her position as the lady of the house.

Years ago, when the Smith child went missing, the entire compound had mobilized to search. Officially, it was declared a case of the child wandering off, but everyone knew Victoria was behind it.

If Andrew didn't sort out his family situation, this engagement wouldn't go smoothly.

Today, he intended to give Luna a helping hand. Having Mayor Li's support would carry more weight than anything else.

Mayor Li's eyes widened as he stared at Andrew and Luna in disbelief. "Dr. White, you and Andrew are really...?"

Andrew turned to Luna, his gaze deep and unreadable.

Luna pressed her lips together in a small smile. "Sir, Instructor Smith is indeed my fiancé. He saved me from drowning in the reservoir and proposed to protect my reputation from village gossip." She playfully winked. "I'd say I got the better end of the deal."

Their shared smile seemed to sweeten the air between them.

Mayor Li clapped Andrew on the shoulder. "You sly dog! I was planning to introduce Dr. White to my useless son!" He suddenly leaned in conspiratorially. "Tell you what—if you're having second thoughts, I can help you call off this engagement."

Luna arched an eyebrow at Andrew, who merely smiled calmly.

"Dr. White," Mayor Li turned to Luna, "the Smiths are too high society for you. If you want out, I'll back you up!"

Luna grabbed Andrew's hand. "Sir, there's no need for concern. Andrew and I have an understanding—he's mine in life and death." She tilted her head at Andrew. "Isn't that right?"

Andrew clasped her slender wrist in return. "Uncle Li, we've already submitted our marriage application. The wedding will happen once Luna turns twenty."

Mayor Li deflated like a punctured balloon.

Nathaniel burst into laughter. "Give it up, old friend! These two are perfect for each other!"

"Bah!" Mayor Li waved him off irritably. "Who wouldn't want such a fine young woman? I was just recognizing quality when I saw it!"

As the banter continued, Luna and Ryan brought out the hot pot. The bubbling spicy broth immediately captured everyone's attention.

Then—screeching tires.

Luna whirled toward the window just in time to see a van barreling straight toward them.

"Run!" she barely had time to shout.

Andrew yanked her into his arms, diving for the corner as—

CRASH!

Shards of glass exploded inward with the winter wind. The van reversed hastily to escape, but Andrew and Andrew were already in pursuit.

Andrew lunged for the door handle as the vehicle accelerated, his body lifting off the ground.

Andrew jumped into his own car, giving chase through the snow-slicked streets in a dangerous game of cat and mouse.

Andrew smashed the window with one punch, reaching in to unlock the door. As it flew open, he used the momentum to roll inside.

"Stop the car!" he roared, locking an arm around the driver's throat.

BAM!

Andrew's car rammed the van. Andrew was thrown to the floor as the driver went flying through the windshield.

Struggling to rise, Andrew felt warm blood dripping down his arm. A gruesome gash revealed white bone beneath torn flesh.
###Chapter 290: Bloodstained Vengeance

With a deafening crash, Andrew Smith kicked open the car door and stormed out.

"What happened?" He rushed to Nathaniel Smith's side in three strides, his voice laced with suppressed fury.

The scene before them was suffocating.

Nathaniel shook his head grimly, his expression dark. The two men strode toward the mangled vehicle. The driver lay in a grotesque pool of blood, his head barely recognizable. Snow mingled with crimson under the streetlight, casting an eerie glow.

"Dead," Nathaniel said coldly after a quick examination.

Andrew slammed his fist against the car door, the metal screeching in protest. "That bastard, Frank!" he spat through gritted teeth, veins bulging at his temples. "Dares to come back looking for death!"

No further explanation was needed—the answer was obvious.

Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on the bloodstains, his eyes shadowed. That car had been aiming for Luna. If he hadn't reacted in time, she would be the one lying there now...

"We'll tear this city apart to find him," he murmured, his quiet tone sending chills down the spine.

Andrew yanked off his tie, revealing a ruthless side he'd never shown before. "He's got a death wish, touching my people on my turf."

Inside the restaurant, chaos reigned.

Luna knelt on the floor, bandaging the wounded, her fingers stained red. Her white coat was soaked in blood, yet she remained composed, swiftly applying needles to stop the bleeding.

"Luna!" Andrew rushed to her side, his hands trembling as he checked her for injuries.

"I'm fine," she said, lifting her head. Her eyes were icy. "He came for me."

Nearby, Luna Whitaker and Ryan Wallace stood pale-faced in the corner. No one would blame them for reconsidering after such a disaster on opening day.

"Nathaniel's already called in a construction crew. They'll have this place fixed by tomorrow," Andrew assured her, gripping her cold hands. "I promise."

Nathaniel ended his call and approached, his suit splattered with blood. "They'll work through the night. You'll have your restaurant back by morning." He bowed deeply. "This is my fault. I'll make it right."

"When you catch him, I want to see him," Luna said, her voice terrifyingly calm.

General Charles Turner took personal charge of the case in his fury, but everyone knew the truth—the evidence was gone with the dead.

After seeing off the last guest, Andrew escorted Luna back to her dorm.

"Get some rest. Tomorrow will be better," he whispered, but as he turned to leave, she caught his arm.

Her eyes locked onto the blood seeping through his bandage. Without a word, she retrieved her silver needles.

"Stay still," she ordered, her fingers trembling slightly as she inserted two needles. A faint energy pulsed through them.

Andrew felt warmth flood his wound, the pain instantly easing.

"Keep it dry," she muttered, her voice hoarse.

As the jeep's taillights vanished into the night, Luna stood by the window, her nails digging into her palms.

She was still too weak.

Too weak to even protect herself.

The realization carved into her heart like a blade. The power and connections from her past life were now just illusions. And the Ferguson family loomed like a beast in the shadows, waiting to tear her apart.

"Not enough..." she whispered into the darkness. "I'm still not strong enough."

Moonlight bathed her pale face, illuminating eyes burning with the fire of vengeance.
###Chapter 291: The Boom

Luna White was distracted all day at work. Fortunately, there weren’t many patients—she only had to administer one acupuncture treatment before spending the rest of her shift idle.

At lunch, she couldn’t swallow a single bite. Her chest felt tight. Compared to that person, she was still too weak. Their starting point was leagues above hers.

When the shift ended, Luna slipped into her black belted down coat. Bright colors were rare in this era, and she never cared for flashy reds anyway. A sapphire-blue scarf made her skin look like snow, while her black block-heeled boots accentuated her tall frame.

Snowflakes drifted from the sky as she stepped out of the hospital. The biting wind howled through the bare branches, the sound sending a chill down her spine.

By the time the bus arrived, the snowfall had thickened. Fat flakes pelted her face, reducing the world to a blur of white. The sky was darker than usual—a blizzard was coming.

She reached the entrance of Old Bai’s Spicy Hot Pot and brushed the snow from her coat. The door was shut, but warm light spilled through the glass windows. The neon sign glowed vividly against the storm.

The wall that had been damaged yesterday stood perfectly intact, as if nothing had happened. The red wooden frames and glass panes were spotless.

Pushing the door open, a wave of heat rushed over her.

"Aunt Luna!" Aaron Jackson greeted her with a grin. "We’re packed today—Mom and Dad can’t keep up!" The teenager’s face was flushed with excitement as he juggled taking her coat and shouting back orders from customers.

"Find a seat, Aunt Luna! I’ll catch up with you later!"

The dining hall buzzed with noise. Every one of the ten tables downstairs was full, steam rising from bubbling pots of broth, fogging up the entire room.

Luna Whitaker and Ryan Wallace darted between tables with two waiters in tow, barely keeping up with the demands.

"Two more plates of lamb!"
"Glass noodles and tofu, please!"
"Another bottle of wine!"
"Tripe and beef omasum—one each!"

The sheer chaos left Luna stunned.

Luna Whitaker finally squeezed behind the counter, wiping sweat from her brow. "Luna, Mr. Smith is incredible! He fixed everything overnight—you’d never know it was damaged. I tried to get him to stay for dinner, but he refused..."

Luna handed her a glass of water. "Don’t worry. There’ll be plenty of chances to thank him later. They’re probably still investigating last night."

"Who did we even offend?" Luna Whitaker frowned.

"Don’t stress. Andrew and his team have it handled." Luna scanned the room. "Was it this busy at lunch? They didn’t bring in customers, did they?"

"No!" Luna Whitaker beamed. "It was a group of officials from the nearby Party School. They came for lunch, loved it, and spread the word—now the whole place is booked! We even have a waiting list."

"We made over a thousand at lunch. Tonight might hit two!" Her voice was hoarse from shouting. She drained the water and rushed back to work.

Luna settled at the counter, watching her sister and brother-in-law hustle. For the first time, she felt at ease. Despite their inexperience, copying the business model from the future had worked beyond expectations.

This style of hot pot would sweep the nation in no time. Within a month, word of mouth would guarantee steady customers.

Compared to state-run restaurants, their service and quality were unmatched.

It seemed fate was finally on their side.
###Chapter 292: Snowstorm Ambush

The clock in the hotpot restaurant struck ten. Luna White stared blankly at the heavy snowfall outside the window. Andrew Smith and Nathaniel Smith still hadn’t returned—it seemed Shang Kaijie, that slippery eel, remained at large.

"Sis, almost done cleaning up?" Luna withdrew her gaze, her fingers absently tapping the table.

Luna Whitaker straightened up from wiping the counter. "All set. This damned weather—the snow’s getting worse." She glanced outside, worry creasing her brow. "You won’t be able to go back tonight."

A cold weight settled in Luna’s chest. Shang Kaijie was undoubtedly plotting his escape back to the capital. A plane would be too conspicuous—a car was his best bet. He could easily commandeer one of his underlings' vehicles and vanish into the blizzard, heading north. Once he reached his family’s territory, even Nathaniel would think twice before making a move.

"Sis, I’ve got a bad feeling," Luna murmured.

Whitaker handed her a steaming cup of tea. "Don’t overthink it. Ryan said he’d stay overnight, and the boys insisted on keeping him company. With three grown men here, nothing will go wrong."

As if on cue, Ryan Wallace and his two stepsons emerged from the kitchen, still bickering about who would stay behind.

"Dad, you should go home and rest. We young guys have energy to spare!" Ethan Whitaker thumped his chest.

Aaron Whitaker chimed in, "Yeah, and we’ve got to prep the spices for tomorrow. It makes sense for us to stay."

Ryan shook his head. "No way, you two reckless—"

"Enough!" Whitaker cut in firmly. "All three of you are staying. There’s a bed for each." She turned to Luna with a smile. "You’ll share my room tonight. Samuel can have the small bed to himself."

Samuel whooped. "Finally! No more listening to Ethan’s snoring or Aaron’s—"

"Brat!" Ethan lunged playfully, only for Ryan to laugh and block him.

Outside, the wind howled and snow swirled, but inside, warmth and laughter filled the air. Luna watched the family’s antics, her lips curving despite the unease gnawing at her.

Before leaving, she pulled Ryan aside. "Be on guard tonight. Shang Kaijie… he’s dangerous."

Ryan’s expression hardened. He grabbed a kitchen knife and tucked it into his belt. "I’ll walk you back."

Battling the storm, the four trudged through the snow. Ryan shielded his wife and son with his broad frame, while Luna clung to her sister’s arm, each step sinking into the drifts. A distance that should’ve taken minutes stretched into half an hour.

Finally home, Whitaker fumbled with the key, her hands trembling from the cold. Ryan stood at the doorstep, brushing snow off his coat. "Lock up. I’ll head back now."

Luna opened her mouth to bid him goodbye—then the hairs on her neck stood on end. She whirled around, yanking Whitaker behind her.

"Long time no see, Dr. White." Shang Kaijie stepped from the shadows, a gleaming knife pressed to Samuel’s throat. The boy’s face was pale, but he clenched his jaw, refusing to cry.

"Close the door," Shang said, tilting his head. "Don’t bother screaming. In this storm, no one will hear you."

Luna slowly shut the door. The lock clicked—a sound like fate’s gears turning. She guided Whitaker into the living room, her eyes never leaving the blade.

"Let the boy go," she said, her voice eerily calm. "It’s me you want."

Shang grinned, baring his teeth. "What’s the rush? The game’s just begun." He released Samuel, who immediately bolted to his mother—but still spread his arms protectively in front of the women.

The wind howled against the windows. The room was deathly silent. Luna studied Shang’s twisted expression, her mind racing. She knew one thing for certain: tonight would be endless.
###Chapter 293: Your Death Warrant

"Dr. White, didn't see this coming, did you?" Shang Kaijie twirled the dagger in his hand, his lips curling into a sinister smirk.

His black leather boot slammed onto the table as he loomed over Luna White. His swollen face twisted with malice, beady eyes glinting with venom.

"Andrew Smith and Nathaniel must be losing their minds by now," he sneered, tapping his nose. "Pity—they'll never find me."

Luna calmly shrugged off her thick down coat, revealing a slim-fitting azure turtleneck. The delicate fabric hinted at her slender frame, yet there was nothing fragile about her poise.

"You can't run forever," she said, meeting his gaze. "The entire province is hunting you. You're nothing but a stray dog."

Shang's grip tightened around the dagger, fury flashing in his eyes. "Even a stray dog can drag a few down with him. Imagine Andrew's face when he sees your corpse—"

He deliberately trailed off, raking his gaze over her.

Luna studied the boy—barely eighteen—and sighed inwardly. Compared to the calculating monster he'd become in a decade, this version was almost laughably naive.

"Sam, step aside." She gently nudged the trembling twelve-year-old shielding her.

"No!" Samuel Jackson planted his feet, voice quivering but stubborn. "He's bad, Aunt Luna!"

"It's alright. He won't hurt us." Her soothing tone belied her sharp focus on Shang's every twitch.

Shang barked a laugh. "Quite the child whisperer, Dr. White." The dagger gleamed as he tilted it. "Too bad I'm here for your life tonight."

Luna stepped forward, palms open in a show of harmlessness. "Are you certain this is your play, Kaijie?"

"Shut up!" he exploded. "You ruined everything!"

His flawless plan had crumbled under the freak snowstorm. Now every exit was crawling with law enforcement.

"Killing me solves nothing," Luna said evenly. "Andrew will hunt you to the ends of the earth."

"You think you matter?" Shang's laughter turned unhinged. "You're just a plaything! The Smiths would never cross the Shangs over trash like you!"

He advanced, blade catching the light. "Tonight, you learn what happens to those who cross me."

Luna didn't flinch. A cryptic smile touched her lips. "Then try."

Her composure was the final spark. With a roar, Shang lunged—dagger aimed straight for her heart—

(To be continued)
###Chapter 294: Life and Death on the Line

Luna White's eyes were locked onto the gleaming dagger, its tip mere inches from her throat. Shang Kaijie's twisted face loomed before her, the stench of blood clinging to him making her stomach churn.

"Five seconds..." she counted silently in her mind. Activating her supernatural ability required five seconds—five seconds that could mean death ten times over.

But she had no choice.

Today, it was either Shang Kaijie's death or hers. This demon had to die, even if it drained the last of her energy. The endless days under the influence of the energy serum, the humiliations under his threats—it all ended today.

"Die!" Luna lunged forward, her hands clamping onto Shang Kaijie's wrist like iron vices.

He sneered. "Is that all you've got?" With effortless ease, he switched hands, the dagger slicing through the air in a silver arc aimed straight for her heart.

At the last possible second, Maya White threw herself in front of her sister. The blade plunged deep into her palm, blood gushing forth.

"Sis!" Luna's vision blurred with rage.

Samuel Jackson, like a feral cub, leapt at Shang Kaijie, sinking his teeth into the man's leg. Shang Kaijie roared in pain and kicked the boy away. Samuel's small frame slammed into the wall, a trickle of blood escaping his lips.

Seizing the moment, Luna barreled into Shang Kaijie. They crashed to the floor, the shattering of dishes piercing the air. Shang Kaijie's skull struck the concrete, leaving him dazed.

"You bitch..." He struggled to rise.

The door burst open. Two armed thugs stormed in, their guns trained on the sisters.

Maya, her bleeding hand still raised, shielded Luna. "Don't be afraid. I'm here."

The gunshots exploded like thunder. Luna yanked her sister to the ground just as the windows shattered, glass raining around them. Miraculously, neither was hit.

Andrew Smith and Jayden Jiang charged in with reinforcements. Amid the chaos of the fight, Luna's heart shattered at the sight of Maya's nearly severed hand. Gritting her teeth, she pulled out silver needles, ignoring the risk of overexerting her ability as she worked to heal her sister.

By the time Andrew subdued the last attacker, Luna had collapsed, trembling violently, her lips tinged blue as if she'd been pulled from an icy abyss.

"Luna!" Andrew scooped her up and carried her to the inner room. He wrapped her tightly in his military coat, but her shivering didn't cease.

"Cold..." Her teeth chattered uncontrollably.

Without hesitation, Andrew unbuttoned his uniform and pressed her icy hands against his warm chest. Luna clung to his heat like a dying traveler desperate for water.

"Better?" His deep voice rumbled near her ear.

She gave a weak nod. Every time her ability was drained, only Andrew's warmth could revive her. This strange "side effect" left her both embarrassed and dependent.

"I can't... keep doing this..." Her voice was barely a whisper.

Andrew tightened his arms around her. "My warmth is always here for you."

Luna rested against his solid chest, listening to his steady heartbeat. In that moment, she realized she was no longer alone. Someone would take bullets for her. Someone would guard her with his life.

It felt... good.

Outside, Shang Kaijie lay bound in the corner, his venomous gaze fixed on the inner room as he snarled in frustration. But everyone knew—in this battle between life and death, evil had lost to justice.
###Chapter 295: Silencing the Witness

Ten minutes later, Luna White finally stopped trembling. What had happened couldn't be undone—there was no use avoiding it now.

"How did you find me?" Her voice still quivered slightly.

Andrew Smith and Nathaniel Smith's timely arrival had been nothing short of a miracle. Shang Kaijie hadn't come alone this time—he'd brought backup and even a gun. If they hadn't shown up when they did...

"We tracked him for a full day and night," Andrew said, his voice low. "The bastard knows how to hide. The last trace we had of him was by the highway before he vanished."

Nathaniel picked up the thread. "We tracked down one of his lackeys' wives. She said her husband went with Shang Kaijie to 'deal with a woman.'"

"We went straight to the hospital dorm," Andrew clenched his fists. "When you weren't there, I knew you'd be here."

Guilt weighed heavily in his voice. "I'm sorry. I promised to protect you."

Luna leaned into his embrace. "This isn't your fault. Shang Kaijie was determined to get revenge—you couldn't have predicted this."

Her warm breath tickled his chest, sending a jolt through him. He suppressed the flutter in his chest. "Warmer now?"

"Yeah."

"Then let's deal with Shang Kaijie." Andrew quickly shrugged on his coat.

As they stepped out of the room, Luna's older sister, Luna Whitaker, approached with a steaming cup of ginger tea.

"You okay now?" She scrutinized her younger sister with concern.

Luna downed the tea in one gulp. "I'm fine, sis."

Only then did Luna Whitaker relax. The state her sister had been in earlier—it was like she'd just crawled back from death's door.

Samuel Jackson came running over, lifting his shirt to reveal a dark bruise on his stomach.

"Does it hurt?" Luna asked, her heart aching at the sight.

"Nah... ow!" The boy tried to tough it out but winced anyway.

Luna gently rubbed the spot, and Samuel immediately sighed in relief. "Auntie's hands are magic!"

"Don't push yourself," Luna Whitaker warned quietly. "You scared us half to death earlier."

Meanwhile, Nathaniel and Andrew were murmuring in low voices. Andrew stepped forward. "Luna, there's something..."

Understanding, Luna turned to her sister. "Sis, take the kids to rest first."

Once Luna Whitaker had ushered the children away, Andrew spoke again. "Shang Kaijie is completely paralyzed now. He can't even speak."

Luna didn't shy away from it. "I did that. It was him or me."

Nathaniel's eyes lit up. "Pressure points?"

"Now we have no choice but to silence him for good," Andrew said grimly.

Luna startled. She hadn't meant to push Andrew to this extreme.

"Wait!" she hurriedly interjected. "It's reversible!"

Both men exhaled in relief. Andrew scratched his head. "I wasn't thinking straight..."

Nathaniel chuckled ruefully. "We panicked."

Luna looked at them, warmth flooding her chest. For her sake, they'd been willing to abandon their principles.

"Let's go," she said softly. "We'll settle this first."

Under the moonlight, their shadows stretched long across the ground. The storm was finally coming to an end.
###Chapter 296: Are You Really That Clueless?

Luna White saw the situation with perfect clarity. Shang Kaijie had to return to the Shang family unharmed—so that if anything happened to him later, it wouldn’t be traced back to them.

"Jiang Shaoqing, I need your help with this," Luna said, locking eyes with him. "It's serious, and the methods might not be... entirely ethical. But Shang Kaijie is someone I have to deal with."

Jiang Shaoqing frowned. If Luna was calling it "unethical," this was no small matter.

Andrew Smith spoke up, his voice heavy with displeasure. "I'm better suited for this than Jiang Shaoqing." It stung—his fiancée turning to someone else for help.

Luna gently squeezed Andrew’s hand. "You're not the right person for this." She turned back to Jiang Shaoqing. "Only you can handle it." This was her test for him—if he helped, they’d be bound together.

Jiang Shaoqing studied her with deep, assessing eyes. She was being brutally direct, testing his limits. Was she really asking him to gamble the entire Jiang family?

"The Jiang family promised to support you," he said carefully, "but only if it doesn’t cross moral lines." Their principles were what kept them standing.

"Don’t worry. It won’t." Luna’s tone was ironclad. A man like Shang Kaijie deserved death a thousand times over. How many lives had he ruined in her past life? How many innocent girls had suffered?

"Oh? Explain." Jiang Shaoqing raised an eyebrow.

Luna leaned in and whispered a few words. His expression darkened instantly.

"And you don’t call that crossing a line?" he hissed. "Shang Kaijie is still a human being, no matter how vile! You’re a doctor—how does this align with your oath?"

Luna smirked coldly. "I’m not the villain here. But Shang Kaijie has to die."

"At worst, he’s violent—not deserving of death!" Jiang Shaoqing struggled to contain his anger. She was far more ruthless than he’d imagined.

"Violent?" Luna’s voice was eerily calm. "If you hadn’t arrived in time, what do you think would’ve happened to my family? Jiang Shaoqing, are you really that clueless?"

Her words struck like daggers. Jiang Shaoqing fell silent. If it had been his family, he’d have already ensured the perpetrator’s demise.

"You might not know this," Luna continued, "but yesterday, Shang Kaijie assaulted a ten-year-old girl. Ask his men—do you think she’s still alive?"

A storm brewed in Jiang Shaoqing’s eyes. The Shang family meant nothing to him. If Shang Kaijie was truly that monstrous...

"Take him away!" Jiang Shaoqing barked. Those who knew him recognized the fury in his voice.

Luna and Andrew got into the car. Her sister fretted over them before they left.

The convoy moved slowly through the snow. Andrew gripped the steering wheel, his expression dark.

The silence inside the car was suffocating.

Finally, Luna spoke. "It’s not that I don’t trust you. Jiang Shaoqing really is the better choice here. You’re a soldier—I can’t let this stain your honor."

"I’m not angry at you." Andrew slammed a fist against the wheel. "I’m angry at myself. I swore to protect you, but I’m always powerless when it matters. This helplessness—"
###Chapter 297: Eyes Burning with Emotion

The car slowly pulled up to a three-story villa—a property owned by the Jiang family, understated yet exuding luxury in every detail. Luna White and Andrew Smith were ushered into a cozy reception room, where the plush leather sofa felt soft to the touch, and an entire wall was lined with a bookshelf filled with hardcover volumes.

Andrew sat close to Luna, draping his coat over her shoulders without a word. Though the room was warm, he couldn’t shake the feeling that she had just endured something exhausting and needed extra comfort.

A loud growl interrupted the silence—Luna’s stomach protesting its emptiness. Andrew immediately turned to the assistant standing nearby. "Could you arrange some food?"

Xiao He hurried off. Even though it was late at night and the kitchen staff should have been asleep, if the boss’s distinguished guests wanted a meal, it had to be prepared on the spot.

The chef, dragged out of bed, rubbed his bleary eyes and frowned at the sparse ingredients left in the fridge. Who in the world needed a meal at this hour?

Ten minutes later, Jiang Shaoqing pushed the door open. His expression was dark as he sank into an armchair, his mind replaying the horrifying news he had just received. Shang Kaijie had only been in the provincial capital for five days, yet he had already preyed on three young girls. The youngest was just eight years old—brutalized, left half-dead by the roadside, and ultimately crawling three miles before collapsing at the village entrance.

"Monster!" Jiang slammed his fist against the armrest. In the capital, the Shang family had kept him on a tight leash, forcing him to restrain his depravity. But away from their watch, the beast had unleashed himself completely. And those who curried favor with him had only enabled his crimes, covering up his atrocities.

"Dr. White," Jiang suddenly spoke, his voice firm. "I take back what I said before. This matter—I’m stepping in."

His intense gaze locked onto Luna. This seemingly delicate young woman had proposed a ruthless yet meticulously calculated plan—one that would eliminate Shang Kaijie while ensuring their own safety. Jiang found himself reassessing her. She was no harmless rabbit—she was a cunning little fox.

"You flatter me, Mr. Jiang," Luna replied with a faint smile. "Shall we begin, then?"

"You’re certain there’s no room for error?" Jiang still hesitated. He didn’t want the Jiang family to take the fall for this.

Luna’s eyes were unwavering. "I know my skills. Harm none, but take no chances."

Jiang stood to make the necessary calls. Time was of the essence—the Shang family could arrive at any moment.

Soon, steaming bowls of wonton soup and tea eggs were brought in. Andrew peeled shrimp while watching Luna devour her food with a frown. "Slow down. No one’s going to take it from you."

"I’m starving," Luna mumbled, her cheeks stuffed. "I couldn’t eat a thing knowing Shang Kaijie was still out there."

Andrew placed the peeled shrimp in her bowl. "Now you’re scared? You seemed plenty brave when you were dealing with him."

"Of course I’m scared!" Luna set down her chopsticks. "He’s already tried to kill someone by ramming their car. Who knows what else he’s capable of?"

Andrew abruptly changed the subject. "But I am curious—how did you know about Shang Kaijie’s secrets? Even Jiang Shaoqing wasn’t aware of these things..."

Luna choked violently, her face flushing red. Andrew quickly patted her back and handed her water.

Once she recovered, he sighed. "Never mind. You don’t have to tell me. Just remember—no matter what happens, I’m here." He gently took her hand. "I’m your husband. Your strongest support."

Luna’s nose stung. From the moment they’d met, this man had protected her without hesitation, never demanding explanations or counting the cost.

"Andrew..." Her voice trembled.

He tenderly fed her a shrimp. "Eat up."

At that moment, Luna felt her eyes burn, something warm threatening to spill over.
###Chapter 298: I Told Her

Jiang Shaoqing pushed the door open, his expression now composed. His slender fingers tapped lightly on the desk. "The Shang family called. Shang Feng and Shang Kaiwen will be here in an hour."

Luna White set down her chopsticks, and Andrew Smith handed her a handkerchief at just the right moment. She accepted it, dabbing her lips with the grace of a noblewoman.

"How prompt," she murmured with a faint smile.

Jiang Shaoqing scoffed. "Their precious heir is in trouble—of course they'd rush over. Shang Feng is cunning, and Shang Kaiwen is even sharper. If she weren't a woman, Shang Kaijie wouldn’t stand a chance in that family." He paused. "Half of the Shang family’s decisions come from that girl’s scheming."

Then it struck him—when had he become Luna’s informant?

This woman was terrifying. She had played him from the very beginning. With Andrew present, even if he didn’t help her, he wouldn’t dare cross Andrew. What a ruthless move.

Jiang gritted his teeth. Andrew’s wife was nothing short of a demon—brilliant in medicine, shrewd in strategy, all wrapped in an innocent face. Everyone at the hospital praised her kindness, but the Luna before him, calculating and composed, was nothing like the rumors.

For a moment, he wondered—was she an angel or a devil?

"Before the Shangs arrive," Luna spoke softly, "let Shang Kaijie take a nap. I don’t want him remembering anything."

Jiang raised a brow. "Straight to the point, aren’t you?" He turned to his assistant. "Put him to sleep—but not for too long."

The assistant hurried off.

"Dr. White," Jiang narrowed his eyes, "do you have some vendetta against the Shangs?"

"A blood feud," Luna replied, her gaze icy. "I want their downfall."

Jiang’s eye twitched. Was she insane?

"Don’t think this doesn’t concern you," Luna suddenly smiled. "The Shang family’s Tianchi Mine has already tunneled beneath your Dongtan Mine. Those two cave-ins—"

Jiang shot to his feet. "How do you know that?"

"I told her," Andrew said calmly.

"You—!" Jiang trembled with anger. "You didn’t think to mention something this important sooner?"

Andrew pulled Luna closer, unapologetic. "My wife wanted to know, so I told her."

"You’re done for!" Jiang jabbed a finger at him. "Henpecked!"

"Gladly." Andrew kissed the top of Luna’s head. "Next time, don’t tell him."

Luna nodded sweetly, grinning like a cat that got the cream.

Jiang massaged his temples. These two were a match made in hell.
###Chapter 299: Undercurrents

"Mr. Smith, Shang Kaijie has fallen asleep," the assistant said in a hushed tone as he pushed the door open.

Luna White stood up and retrieved an acupuncture kit from her bag. "Take me to him."

The assistant hesitated, glancing at Andrew Smith for approval—only the CEO had the final say here.

Andrew waved impatiently. "What are you waiting for? Take Dr. White!"

Once they left, Andrew's expression darkened. "Andrew, this involves our entire plan. Are you sure you want to tell Luna?"

Andrew Smith's gaze was resolute. "She's my wife."

"But this is classified business information!" Andrew loosened his tie irritably. "You know how troublesome the Shang family is. What if—"

"There won't be any 'what if,'" Andrew cut him off. "Luna is more reliable than you think. She saved my life—and yours."

Andrew fell silent. That mining accident—it was Luna who had pulled them both out in time.

"I'm just worried..." He sighed. "Once women know too much, they tend to—"

"She's different." Andrew's eyes softened. "She's never let me down."

Before Andrew could respond, the door opened.

Luna walked in, casually returning the acupuncture kit to her bag. "Done. He'll be up and about when he wakes."

Andrew checked his watch. "The Shang family will be here in half an hour. You two should leave first."

Andrew picked up Luna's coat and draped it over her shoulders, carefully adjusting her scarf. Andrew frowned—since when had the cold, ruthless man he knew become so attentive?

"We'll talk tomorrow." Andrew guided Luna toward the door.

Luna suddenly turned back, a sly smile playing on her lips. "Mr. Smith, don’t forget to make the Shangs pay. After all..." She winked. "We did save their precious heir."

"You sure know how to bargain," Andrew scoffed.

"Takes one to know one." Luna laughed, linking her arm with Andrew's.

As they reached the lobby, they nearly collided with a father and daughter. The moment they passed each other, Luna felt a scrutinizing gaze.

Shang Kaiwen.

Those seemingly innocent eyes hid a viper's venom. Luna clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Andrew sensed her tension and gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

Once in the car, Luna exhaled deeply. In the rearview mirror, Shang Kaiwen remained standing, watching their departure with a thoughtful expression.

"Does she suspect something?" Andrew asked.

Luna shook her head. "Just a woman's intuition." Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Soon, she'll learn what retribution feels like."

Andrew took her icy hand in his. "Patience. We'll take it slow."

The car disappeared into the night. Inside the building, Shang Kaiwen suddenly clutched her chest.

"What's wrong?" Shang Feng frowned.

"Nothing." She forced a smile but couldn't resist glancing back one last time.

That stranger's gaze had unsettled her in a way she couldn't explain.
###Chapter 300: The Threat

Shang Feng's face was dark with fury. His worthless son seemed incapable of staying out of trouble. While in the capital, he had at least shown some restraint, but the moment he stepped outside, he became as wild as an untamed stallion. And now, he had provoked Jiang Shaoqing of all people. Could the mess he created be any worse?

He had only this one son—sometimes he wished he only had daughters. Look at how sensible Xiao Wen was, managing all the household affairs with ease. But this son of his? The difference between them was like night and day.

Yet, what could he do? His mother had fainted from crying, his father had nearly suffered a heart attack, and his wife was drowning in tears. As a father, he didn’t even have the right to discipline his own son.

Shang Kaijie had been spoiled rotten by the entire family. And now, he had the audacity to attempt murder—and was caught red-handed. If it had been an ordinary person, they might have been able to smooth things over with money. But of all people, it had to be the Jiang family’s lifesaver. Old Man Jiang was notoriously protective of his own. This matter wouldn’t be resolved easily.

As he entered the reception room, his assistant respectfully guided him in. Jiang Shaoqing was lounging leisurely on the sofa and only rose slowly when they entered.

"Uncle Shang, please have a seat."

Shang Kaiwen immediately stepped forward. "Brother Jiang, it’s been a while. I apologize on behalf of Xiao Jie for the trouble he’s caused you." She played the emotional card wisely, hoping to minimize the damage.

Shang Feng forced a smile. "Yes, this boy is young and impulsive. He doesn’t think before he acts. I’ll make sure he apologizes to the doctor personally and guarantees it won’t happen again." Sitting on the sofa, he felt uneasy. Facing someone younger than him shouldn’t have made him feel so on edge, yet here he was, restless as if sitting on pins and needles.

Jiang Shaoqing gestured for his assistant to serve tea. "Uncle, Xiao Wen, please have some tea."

When Jiang Shaoqing didn’t respond to their overtures, Shang Feng’s heart sank. Despite his youth, Jiang Shaoqing had inherited his grandfather’s shrewdness and was notoriously difficult to deal with in business. Today’s negotiation wouldn’t be easy.

Shang Kaiwen took a sip of tea, showing no sign of discomfort. "Brother Jiang, where is the injured doctor? I’d like to apologize in person. Whatever conditions you have, we’ll agree to them." If Jiang Shaoqing wouldn’t budge, she’d find another way.

"Unfortunately, she just left." Jiang Shaoqing raised an eyebrow. "You didn’t run into her?" Trying to catch him off guard? This father-daughter pair had arrived half an hour early—he knew exactly what they were plotting.

"Were those two just now Dr. White?" Shang Kaiwen feigned surprise. Internally, she was shocked. That girl looked no older than seventeen or eighteen. How could she be a doctor? The man protecting her also looked familiar, but she couldn’t place him.

"Dr. White is the second daughter-in-law of the Smith family. Andrew Smith escorted her home." Jiang Shaoqing casually dragged the Smiths into the matter. "At this late hour, only someone like me, burdened with responsibilities, would still be entertaining you."

Shang Feng nearly choked on his own breath. How had the Smiths gotten involved? He wasn’t very familiar with Andrew Smith—after moving out of the compound years ago, he’d lost touch with many old acquaintances.

"I see." Shang Kaiwen quickly played the nostalgia card. "Brother Andrew took care of me often when we were kids. Brother Jiang, considering we grew up together—"

"This is complicated." Jiang Shaoqing cut her off. "Last night’s car accident nearly cost Dr. White her life, and there were multiple victims. The circumstances are extremely severe."

Shang Feng couldn’t help but interject. "There’s no proof that Xiao Jie was involved. It could’ve just been a drunk driver—"

Jiang Shaoqing crossed his legs leisurely and took a sip of tea. Getting nervous? Thinking there were no witnesses? They underestimated him.

"General Liam Turner and Colonel Han Weiguo were both present last night. The investigation results were personally relayed to me by General Turner." He spoke slowly. "We initially just wanted an apology from Shang Kaijie, but instead, he escalated things by sending men to attack Dr. White’s sister’s home. Had we arrived a moment later, three lives would’ve been lost."

His gaze turned icy. "Think carefully—if something had actually happened, what do you think the Smiths, General Turner, and our Jiang family would have done?"

This was nothing short of a blatant threat.
###Chapter 301: Total Loss

"How is this possible?" Sean Shaw's throat tightened as his fingers unconsciously traced the rim of his teacup. His useless son had truly outdone himself this time.

The wrath of the Smith family, the retaliation from the Whites, and now the pressure from the Johnsons... Kevin Shaw was dragging the entire Shaw family down with him.

Kelsey Shaw's eyes flickered as she spoke softly, "Shawn, what's done is done. Though no irreversible harm was caused, we're deeply remorseful. My brother has always been reckless—spoiled since childhood. We'll take full responsibility. Please, for the sake of our families' long-standing relationship..."

She deliberately paused, studying Shawn Johnson's expression. If he had personally intervened, he must have ulterior motives. Surely he didn't actually intend to send Kevin to prison?

"Yes, yes! We'll compensate!" Sean hastily agreed, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. He had long lost control of the negotiation.

Shawn smirked coldly. "Uncle Sean, your son nearly cost someone their life. If anything had happened to Andrew Smith's fiancée, do you think the Smiths would let this go? Not to mention Dr. White saved my grandfather's life..."

He deliberately drew out his words, watching Sean's face pale further.

"I'll discipline him strictly!" Sean wiped his sweat, his voice trembling. "If that brat causes trouble again, I'll break his legs myself!"

Shawn twirled a pen between his fingers before abruptly changing the subject. "I heard your Tianchi Coal Mine... borders our Dongtan site?"

Sean's heart lurched, nearly dropping his teacup. Had they been discovered?

"I... I leave those matters to subordinates. I'm not entirely familiar..." He forced composure, but his voice betrayed him.

Kelsey inwardly cursed. Her father's reaction was practically a confession.

"Uncle Sean," Shawn's gaze turned icy, "your Tianchi mine breached our tunnels twice this year, causing collapses. Are you truly unaware?"

The air in the office froze.

Kelsey quickly interjected, "Shawn, the workers must have kept this from my father. We're willing to—"

"Enough." Shawn raised a hand to silence her. "Two conditions: First, Tianchi and the two adjacent mines are to be transferred to Dongtan at their original value. Second, the deed to Dr. White's family hotpot restaurant goes to her sister."

Sean looked as if struck by lightning. His teacup shattered on the floor. Tianchi generated hundreds of millions annually—this was nothing short of carving flesh from his bones!

"Take your time to consider." Shawn stood, straightening his suit. "I'll expect your answer by dusk. Otherwise..." He glanced meaningfully at his watch. "Your son has more than just this one crime to answer for."

Kelsey dug her nails into her palm. She knew all too well the skeletons in her brother's closet. If they dug deeper...

"Dad!" she urged urgently. "Agree!"

Sean's face was ashen. Compared to his son's life, what were coal mines worth?

"I... accept." The words seemed to drain the last of his strength.

Shawn smiled in satisfaction. "I'll take you to see your son."

As he turned, a glint of steel flashed in his eyes. Luna was right—the Shaws had indeed been eyeing Dongtan.
###Chapter 302: Resolution

When Sean Shaw and Kelsey Shaw followed Shawn Johnson into the room, Kevin Shaw was still sound asleep, wrapped tightly in his blanket, completely unaware of the disaster he had caused.

Billions in losses—gone, just like that, while he slept.

Sean trembled with rage. He yanked the blanket off and kicked his son hard.

"Who the hell dares—" Kevin bolted upright, fists clenched, only to deflate instantly when he saw who stood before him. "Dad... Kelsey..."

He immediately realized the situation had escalated—his father and sister wouldn’t have come in person otherwise. The usually arrogant young man now looked as pitiful as a wilted plant.

Truthfully, he had been awake for a while. Once he realized his limbs could move again, he’d guessed the paralysis from the fall had been temporary. He was certain Shawn wouldn’t actually harm him, so he’d gone back to sleep.

Yesterday’s desperate escape had only been for pride’s sake. The last thing he wanted was to drag his father and sister into this mess.

Yet here they were.

"How dare you sleep? You tried to kill someone—is there anything you won’t do?" Sean’s voice shook with fury. He wanted nothing more than to beat this worthless son senseless.

Kevin quickly plastered on an ingratiating smile. "Dad, I messed up. But that woman provoked me..." He shot a glance at Shawn, carefully framing the attempted murder as mere "discipline."

"Shawn, considering our families’ friendship, could you let this slide...?" His tone was obsequious, knowing Shawn wouldn’t truly abandon him.

Shawn responded coldly, "Mr. Shaw, you’ve seen him—I haven’t laid a finger on him. Once the contract is signed, you’re free to take him."

He couldn’t stand looking at Kevin a second longer. Disgusting.

Sean kicked his son twice more, his heart bleeding—this fool had cost them billions!

"Stay put and don’t move!" he barked before storming out with Kelsey.

Kevin blinked in confusion.

Soon, all formalities were completed. Shawn tapped the contract. "Robert, escort them out."

Watching the Shaw family leave, Shawn whistled under his breath.

Billions—just like that.

All thanks to Luna’s tip. He’d never been interested in the Tianchi Coal Mine, but this outrageous demand actually put the Shaws at ease—they wouldn’t suspect any ulterior motives.

"Deliver the deed to Luna," he instructed his assistant. "Tell her it’s what she earned. And that she shouldn’t be too grateful."

The assistant nodded and left.

Shawn exhaled deeply. Making billions overnight through what amounted to highway robbery—and he felt no guilt whatsoever.

Had Luna corrupted him?

He needed to stay far away from that woman.

Luna returned to her dorm for a short nap before heading to work on time. One sleepless night wouldn’t kill her—she could always catch up on rest later.

In her office, her mind wandered. She wondered how Andrew was doing. Between training and work, his days were far more grueling than her clinic shifts.

She considered calling but decided against it.

After treating an elderly patient for back pain and receiving effusive thanks, she finally noticed someone else in the room.

"Dr. White, Mr. Johnson asked me to deliver this." The assistant bowed slightly. "He said no thanks are necessary."

Luna accepted the manila envelope. "Please convey my gratitude. And tell him following my advice guarantees success."

The assistant nearly choked. This woman had nerve.

Once alone, Luna opened the documents and smiled.

Shawn was indeed a shrewd businessman—and surprisingly fair.

She hadn’t expected any profit from this, but he’d considered everything.

Was this profit-sharing?

Well, if he got the meat, she was content with the broth.

This land would be invaluable once redeveloped. Her sister and brother-in-law’s business would flourish—it was destined to become prime real estate.
###Chapter 303: The Uncanny Resemblance

Luna White tucked the manila envelope into her desk drawer, her fingers tapping lightly on the wooden surface.

"Come in."

She glanced at her wristwatch—still an hour before her next patient.

The door swung open.

Sean Shaw entered with Kevin Shaw and Kelsey Shaw in tow. Dressed in designer outfits, the trio stood out conspicuously in the hospital corridor. Kevin's handsome face was twisted into a scowl dark enough to rival storm clouds.

"Dr. White," Sean said with practiced cordiality, "my son has been... difficult. We apologize for the inconvenience."

A nudge from his father forced Kevin forward two reluctant steps.

"Sor—ry," he ground out through clenched teeth.

Kelsey smoothly slid a bulging envelope across the desk. "A small token of our appreciation."

Luna didn't touch it. Instead, she leaned back in her chair and gestured to the "Medical Ethics Code" plaque on the wall. "Mr. Shaw, are you asking me to violate professional conduct?"

Sean's smile faltered. His gaze lingered on Luna's features, then his pupils constricted abruptly.

The resemblance was uncanny.

Those eyes—the exact replica of that woman's.

"Where are you from, Dr. White?" The question escaped him before he could stop it.

Luna checked her watch again. "Unless this is a medical consultation, I must ask you not to occupy my scheduled appointment slots."

Kelsey caught her father's odd reaction and tugged discreetly at his sleeve. "Dad?"

Sean blinked, forcing another smile. "Perhaps lunch—"

"Not interested." The refusal came swift and final.

Outside the consultation room, the waiting line had grown. With no choice, the Shaw family retreated.

In the hallway, Kelsey whispered, "Do you know her?"

Sean wiped his damp forehead. "She looks... exactly like your mother when she was young."

Kelsey whirled around, peering through the door's narrow gap at Luna inside.

"You mean—"

"Twenty years ago, in the countryside..." Sean's voice shook. "They said she died in childbirth..."

A calculating gleam entered Kelsey's eyes.

"If that's true..." Her crimson lips curved. "This could be very useful indeed."
###Chapter 304: Reunion with the Past

Luna White rubbed her sore neck, finally making it to the end of her shift. Outside, the snow had stopped, but the roads remained treacherously icy. The hospital had organized a snow-clearing rotation in response to the government's call, and this afternoon, it was the Traditional Medicine Department's turn.

"What a hassle," she muttered under her breath, swapping her white coat for a thick down jacket. As she slipped her hands into her pockets, she caught sight of two familiar figures in the waiting area—Kelsey Shaw and Sean Shaw.

"Persistent as ghosts," Luna thought bitterly, turning sharply toward the cafeteria.

The warm aroma of lamb and radish stew filled the air. She had barely settled with her tray when the two unwelcome guests slid into the seat across from her.

"Dr. White, what a coincidence," Kelsey said with a sweet, practiced smile.

Luna paused, chopsticks hovering over her food. "The hospital cafeteria isn’t exactly spacious. Quite the coincidence," she emphasized the word.

Sean's gaze was uncomfortably intense. "Dr. White, you remind me of someone I once knew..."

"Oh?" Luna arched a brow. "Are you here to claim kinship, Mr. Shaw?"

"Her name was Julia Shaw. Back in Six Paths Village..." His voice trembled slightly.

Luna's heart lurched. Julia Shaw—her birth mother's name.

"Sorry, my parents never mentioned it," she said coolly, setting down her chopsticks. "Their biggest concern before they passed was me."

Sean pressed urgently, "Are you sure there’s no connection?"

"None." Her tone was final. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Kelsey sipping her soup delicately, feigning disinterest.

Just as Luna stood to leave, Dr. Sandra Miller, the hospital director, appeared.

"Sean Shaw?" Dr. Miller's eyes widened in surprise. "It really is you!"

Seizing the chance, Luna excused herself, though her mind reeled. If Dr. Miller knew Sean, she likely knew Julia too...

Glancing back before exiting, she saw the two deep in conversation. The fervor in Sean’s expression reminded her of the way Kelsey had looked at her in her past life—like a predator eyeing prey.

"An old acquaintance?" Luna scoffed under her breath. "More like an enemy."

Her fists clenched, nails digging into her palms. Whether Sean was her biological father or not, this score would be settled.
###Chapter 305: Déjà Vu

Luna White's figure disappeared at the end of the corridor, yet Sean Shaw's gaze lingered, unable to pull away.

Too familiar.

That slight tilt of her chin when she turned, that cool, distant aura—it was identical to the woman in his memories.

"You think she looks familiar too, don't you?" Dr. Sandra Miller sighed softly.

Sean snapped out of his thoughts and quickly introduced, "This is my daughter, Kelsey Shaw. Kelsey, say hello to Dr. Miller."

"Hello, Dr. Miller," Kelsey greeted obediently, her voice gentle.

"What a well-mannered girl," Dr. Miller remarked warmly, studying her. "How old are you?"

"Eighteen."

Dr. Miller's expression shifted slightly, her gaze turning thoughtful as she glanced at Sean.

Sean immediately understood her unspoken question and forced a bitter smile. "Julia and I had already separated by then. She... fell in love with someone else."

He lowered his eyes, his tone heavy. "Let's not talk about it. Just consider it my fault."

After all, the dead couldn’t defend themselves.

"Impossible!" Dr. Miller shook her head in disbelief. "Julia adored you. How could she—?"

The girl who had willingly cut ties with her family for Sean—how could she have changed her heart?

"Some memories are better left in the past," Sean deflected. "I never expected you to become the hospital director. I’m truly happy for you."

A calculating gleam flickered in his eyes. A hospital director—now that was a valuable connection.

"That Dr. White..." Sean feigned hesitation. "She looks so much like Julia."

"Yes, but she has parents and siblings. It’s probably just a coincidence," Dr. Miller said, her expression dimming.

"I remember Julia was sent to a rural area near Dr. White’s hometown back then..."

Dr. Miller looked up sharply. "Really?"

"If Julia’s child were still alive, they’d be about that age now," Sean murmured. "But the Yu family..."

"The Yus never returned to the capital after their rehabilitation," Dr. Miller said, shaking her head. "I heard Old Man Yu’s health declined, and his sons stayed with him in the countryside."

Sean exhaled inwardly in relief.

After exchanging contact information, he deliberately added, "If you hear anything about Dr. White, please let me know."

As she watched the father and daughter leave, Dr. Miller fell into deep thought. She would get to the bottom of this.

The black sedan pulled away from the hospital slowly.

"Dad, are we just letting this go?" Kelsey asked quietly.

"Send someone to investigate," Sean said, narrowing his eyes. "If she really is my daughter, bringing her back to the family is only right."

He turned to his daughter. "As for your mother..."

"I’ll handle it," Kelsey replied with a faint smile, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.

For the sake of the Shaw family, anyone could be sacrificed.
###Chapter 306: Blood for Blood

Luna White slammed the office door shut, her chest heaving violently. Sean Shaw's probing words echoed in her mind—what nonsense about old acquaintances? That piercing gaze had felt like it could see right through her.

"Like I'd fall for that," she muttered through clenched teeth.

Her fists tightened until her nails dug into her palms. She never imagined Sean would be that deadbeat father who abandoned his wife and child. Even more shocking—Kelsey and Kevin Shaw were her half-siblings.

"Family turning on each other?" Luna let out a bitter laugh. "They don't deserve that title."

Now everything made sense—Kelsey's schemes and Kevin's humiliations in her past life. They'd known the truth all along yet treated her like a thorn in their side.

"Blood for blood," Luna's eyes flashed with cold determination. "This time, you'll taste your own medicine."

Outside the hospital, the snow had been cleared away. Beads of sweat formed on Luna's forehead despite the cold. She unzipped her coat, letting the winter wind rush in, but it did nothing to extinguish the fire burning in her chest.

"Luna!" Maya's voice carried from the hotpot restaurant. "Get in here and warm up!"

The place buzzed with activity, every seat occupied by waiting customers. Though swamped with work, Maya still found time to pour her sister a steaming cup of tea.

"Let me help." Luna tied on an apron and disappeared into the kitchen.

Inside, Ethan Jackson struggled to keep up with the mountain of vegetables needing chopping. Without a word, Luna grabbed a knife. The blade flashed, sending perfectly sliced potatoes into neat piles.

"Aunt Luna, we're working ourselves to death here," Ethan groaned.

Her hands never stopped moving. "Starting tomorrow, we're changing things. Pre-slice and freeze the meat, prep all vegetables before opening, switch to self-service seasoning..."

"Won't that cause waste?"

"Relax." A faint smile touched her lips. "No one would dare embarrass themselves like that in public."

When the last customer left, everyone slumped in exhaustion. Luna stared into the night through the window, her gaze turning icy.

"Shaw family," she whispered. "We'll settle our accounts slowly."
###Chapter 307: Prosperous Days

With a clatter, Luna White placed the last stack of bowls into the sterilizer and wiped the sweat from her brow. Ryan Wallace was mopping the floor, while the new kitchen helper had already collapsed onto the table, exhausted.

The past two days had been insane. Before opening, they never imagined business would boom like this—they were severely understaffed. Everyone was working triple shifts, barely finding time to take a sip of water.

Slurp— Luna cradled a large bowl of thick soup, eating with gusto. After the lunch rush, she had personally cooked a full pot, and now those who still had energy were devouring it.

"Sis!" Luna swallowed a mouthful of hot broth. "We really need to hire more help. You were scrambling with the cash register today—if you make a mistake, the loss could cover two waitresses' wages."

Luna and Ryan exchanged glances, their faces brimming with joy. The White Family Spicy Hotpot had officially taken off. Though they weren’t sure how long this surge would last—especially with the boost from the recent community event—it was a promising start.

"Your brother-in-law and I were just discussing that," Luna said, drying her hands. "We had so many new customers today, all brought in by regulars. We’re thinking of recruiting from our home village—people we know well, easier to manage."

Luna frowned. "Sis, you can’t turn the back room into a dorm! Fire regulations strictly prohibit it. If something happens, the consequences would be disastrous."

"She’s right," Andrew Smith’s voice came from the doorway, snow still dusting his shoulders. "I know a reliable security guard who’s looking for work."

Luna’s eyes brightened, her lips curling into an unconscious smile. She had known he’d come today.

Andrew’s chest warmed at the sight of her grin. In that moment, he finally understood what poets meant by "a single glance that outshines a thousand charms."

"Get Andrew a bowl of soup!" Luna fretted, stomping her foot. "Honestly, girl, don’t you know how to take care of your own man?"

Andrew had already helped himself to a generous serving. "Don’t trouble yourself, sis. I’ve got it." He took a deep sip, the warmth spreading from his stomach to his limbs. This place always felt so alive—nothing like his own cold, empty home.

"Who made this? It’s delicious," he asked, feigning ignorance.

"It was Auntie Luna!" Samuel Jackson piped up.

Andrew’s eyes gleamed as he sidled up to Luna. "Any news from Shawn Johnson?"

"He sent the land deed," she murmured. "Oh, and look into someone for me—Julia Shaw."

Andrew’s pupils constricted. He knew that name—the eldest daughter of the Shaw family.

"And dig up everything you can on the Shaws. The more details, the better," Luna added.

"Aren’t you going to ask why?" She tilted her head.

Andrew chuckled. "You always have your reasons. I know your heart—even if you don’t always see it yourself."

Luna nearly choked on her soup. Was this man handing her a good person card? Should she even accept it?

"Stop grinning. I’m taking you home to rest," Andrew pinched her cheek. "You barely slept last night."

Luna rattled off more suggestions for kitchen renovations, and Luna and Ryan nodded eagerly. Their daily revenue had already surpassed five thousand, with profits in the thousands—something they’d never dreamed of back in the village.

Ryan was fired up. He’d expected to be hauling bricks in the city, but now he was a business owner. At this rate, they could buy a house and settle down within a year.

Life was truly getting better by the day.
###Chapter 308: Fruit Platter

In the kitchen, William Cooper focused intently on slicing beef while Old Harold stirred tofu in a sizzling wok, the metal spatula clinking against the iron pan. With one more dish of shredded potatoes, the meal would be complete. Since those women had left last time, the year had flown by, and they hadn't returned.

William knew the ten dollars he'd secretly slipped out had vanished without a trace.

But he wasn't discouraged. If one attempt failed, he'd try again. Sooner or later, an opportunity would come. He had to escape.

This godforsaken place was hell on earth. Even during the New Year, there was no rest. The so-called "festive feast" was just a few paper-thin slices of meat in the pot—so meager you could barely see them, let alone taste them.

He'd been here over half a year. Li Xiaozhu, who arrived with him, had long since disappeared. The coal mine was a devouring beast, swallowing men whole. The last cave-in had killed several, but who cared? Hank kept bringing in fresh bodies.

This was a living nightmare—no escape, no survival.

If not for Hank, William would've died long ago. But what difference did it make now? He missed his brother and sister-in-law, his three nieces and nephews, and most of all, Luna—how was she faring in the provincial capital?

Regret gnawed at him. He'd been too naive, too greedy, and had fallen for the trap. Everyone here had been tricked. No one ever escaped. Rumor had it someone had once fled, but the coward hadn't even dared report to the police, slinking home like a beaten dog.

After that, security tightened. No one got out.

"Will! Deliver the food!" Old Harold's voice snapped him from his thoughts.

The old man's bad leg made carrying trays risky. William responded, arranging the tofu, shredded potatoes, sliced beef, and roasted chicken neatly on a platter.

"Quick in and out," Harold muttered under his breath. "Left you some food under the stove."

They'd survived this long by relying on each other. Harold had endured five years here, clinging to thoughts of his wife and child. William's arrival had given him some solace.

A guard barked impatiently, "Quit dawdling! Boss gets angry, you'll regret it!"

William forced a smile. "Lead the way, sir. The tray's heavy, but I'll keep up."

His fingers curled around his last five dollars. This was his final chance.

Inside the main building, the air was thick with perfume, liquor, and rich food—a world apart from the squalor outside, where men lived worse than animals while others drowned in decadence.

William kept his head down but scanned the room. The woman from last time was still there, perched beside the boss, her blouse gaping to reveal pale cleavage that seemed to hypnotize the man.

"Boss, the food is served," William said respectfully.

The boss barely glanced at him. "Where's the fruit? Bring bananas and oranges."

As William turned to leave, a voice stopped him.

"Wait!" It was Sally.

His body tensed. Was she about to expose him? His grip tightened on the tray's edge—where a sharpened wooden chopstick lay hidden. If it came to it, he'd go down fighting.

"Just plain fruit is boring," Sally purred, draping herself over the boss. "Have him make a fruit platter."

The boss pinched her waist. "Always full of ideas." He jerked his chin at William. "You heard her. Make it fancy."

William feigned hesitation. "Boss, we country folk don't know how..."

The room erupted in laughter.

The boss rubbed his bald head, grinning. "My cook's a bumpkin. Doesn't know your city tricks."

Sally swayed to her feet. "Then I'll teach him." She winked at William. "Don't worry, little brother. I won't bite."

Amid the jeers, William "nervously" backed away.

Sally followed him out toward the kitchen.

This time, no one trailed behind.
###Chapter 309: Improvisation

"What's your name?" Sally asked, following William in her high heels at a deliberately slow pace. Her eyes casually scanned their surroundings as workers on the construction site averted their gazes, recognizing them as emerging from the second-floor office.

"William," he muttered, his voice barely audible, fingers tightening around the hem of his shirt.

Sally suddenly chuckled. "What was that ten-dollar bill you gave me the other day supposed to mean?" She studied the young man—his sun-darkened skin contrasting with unusually clear, bright eyes. He looked meek, yet his actions suggested otherwise.

William swallowed hard. "To save me."

"Save you?" Sally burst into laughter, covering her crimson-painted lips. "Boss Shaw treats his workers well. Unless you're—" Her words cut short when she met William's unwavering gaze.

"Write a letter for me," he whispered urgently. "Say I'm trapped in an illegal coal mine, under watch. I'll give you the address." He hesitated. "You won't be implicated."

Sally's smile froze. Instinctively, she started to glance back, but William hissed, "Don't turn around!"

Catching on, she giggled and leaned into him flirtatiously. "Why so serious, sweetheart?"

William recoiled as if burned, his ears flushing scarlet. Raucous laughter erupted from the second-floor window, Boss Shaw's voice booming above the rest: "Sally, stop teasing the poor guy!"

Relief washed over her—the act had worked. Swaying her hips, she headed toward the kitchen, William trailing behind with noticeably unsteady steps.

Inside, Old Harold squatted by the stove, smoking. William focused on clumsily yet earnestly chopping fruit while Sally leaned against the doorframe, fingers drumming lightly against her arm.

"Done. Take it upstairs," she instructed, motioning for him to follow.

At the stairwell landing, William suddenly grabbed her wrist. Sally felt a crumpled bill pressed into her palm and clenched her fist without a flicker of reaction.

The second-floor private room was hazy with smoke. Boss Shaw pulled Sally onto his lap, eyeing the five-dollar note in her hand with disdain. "This pitiful amount?" He made to toss it aside.

"No!" She snatched it back, tucking it into her cleavage. "It's my lucky charm today!" She pouted playfully. "If you think it's too little, how about—"

Boss Shaw guffawed, yanking her closer. "Five grand! Do well tonight, and I'll give you a fat red envelope!"

Sally kissed him, her peripheral vision catching William slipping out of the room with his head bowed. Her tension finally eased—the address-scrawled bill now pressed securely over her heart.
###Chapter 310: Urgent Telegram

The morning sun had just begun to filter into the office when Luna White was unbuttoning her white coat. The door burst open with a loud bang.

"Dr. White!" The energetic intern, Li, rushed in, waving a stack of letters. "An urgent telegram for you!"

Luna raised an eyebrow. "So lively this early in the morning?" She took the telegram and casually pulled a chocolate bar from her desk drawer. "Here, a reward for you."

Li's eyes lit up, though she tried to appear composed. "That's more like it." She quickly pocketed the chocolate, though the corners of her mouth betrayed her delight.

Luna observed the lively intern with quiet approval. Despite her boisterous nature, Li never overstepped. The chocolates on the desk never disappeared unless given by Luna herself.

The moment she tore open the telegram, Luna's smile vanished.

"What's wrong?" Li sensed the shift in mood.

Without answering, Luna grabbed the phone and dialed. Factory Manager Victor Green's obsequious voice came through the line. "Dr. White, I'll get Director Iris for you right away."

"Second Sister!" Luna's voice was urgent the moment the call connected. "Any news about William?"

"Nothing yet. That boy—" Iris began, but Luna cut her off.

"He's in trouble!" Luna's voice trembled. "I just got a distress telegram—he's been taken captive!"

A loud clatter sounded from the other end, as if something had been knocked over. "What? William, he—" Iris's voice rose sharply. "I'm coming with your brother-in-law right now!"

"Wait!" Luna forced herself to stay calm. "Let me investigate first. You—"

"Investigate what?" Iris was nearly in tears. "That boy was practically raised by me!"

After hanging up, Iris, red-eyed, made to dash out. Victor quickly intercepted her. "Director White, what's happened?"

"My brother's been taken..." Iris stammered in distress.

Victor's eyes flickered with calculation. "Don't panic. I'll approve your leave immediately." The moment Iris left, he dialed his father-in-law.

Meanwhile, in the military compound, Old Mr. Turner was giving orders to Richard Adams. "Take Nathaniel with you. Make sure this is handled properly."

Richard snapped to attention. "Mission will be accomplished!"

Luna stared at the hastily scrawled "HELP" on the telegram, her fingers tightening unconsciously. What had happened to William? A grown man taken captive... Her mind flashed to horrifying rumors of organ trafficking, sending a chill down her spine.

"Dr. White?" Li looked at her with concern. "What can I do?"

Luna took a deep breath. "Contact the Security Department for me." She needed to verify the telegram's authenticity first. If it was real... Her fists clenched. Then every second counted.

Outside the window, sparrows chirped as they flitted past, oblivious to human suffering. Luna watched them, her heart heavy. William, hold on...
###Chapter 311: Midnight Rescue

Luna White's fingers trembled slightly over the phone buttons. She took a deep breath and dialed the number she knew by heart.

"Hello, is Instructor Andrew available?" Her voice quivered.

"Oh, it's you, Mrs. Smith! Hold on, I'll get Captain Andrew right away!" The young soldier on the other end boomed cheerfully before his footsteps faded away.

The receiver picked up the sound of hurried running and the rustle of fabric.

"Luna?" Andrew Smith's voice came through the line, slightly breathless.

Luna's nails dug into her palm unconsciously. "Andrew..." Her voice caught, unsure where to begin.

"What's wrong?" His tone instantly sharpened.

Luna looked down at the crumpled telegram in her hand. "It's William... my brother-in-law's younger brother..."

A brief silence stretched on the other end. "What happened?"

"I need your help." She bit her lower lip. "The telegram says he's being held captive in the mountains of a neighboring province..."

"Wait for me." Andrew hung up without another word.

Thirty minutes later, the office door burst open. Andrew strode in, his military jacket still carrying the chill from outside. His sharp eyes immediately locked onto Luna's pale face.

"Where's the telegram?" he asked firmly.

Luna handed it over with shaking hands. Andrew scanned the contents quickly, his frown deepening with each line.

"Do you think... could it be..." Luna's voice was barely audible, "organ trafficking?"

Andrew's head snapped up, his gaze razor-sharp. "Don't jump to conclusions." He grasped her icy hands. "I'll report this immediately."

Luna clutched his sleeve desperately. "My sister Iris won't survive this..."

"Leave it to me." He pulled her into a brief, reassuring hug. "I'll lead the team myself."

That afternoon, Henry Cooper arrived in the provincial capital, exhausted from travel. Luna had arranged for her eldest sister to house him at the family shop to keep him from spiraling into panic.

Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the military district meeting room was tense.

"This is a sensitive situation—we must proceed with caution." The commander rapped his knuckles on the table. "Andrew, take two men for reconnaissance first."

"Sir!" Andrew saluted crisply.

In the locker room, three grown men stood before mirrors, deliberately disfiguring their appearances—unkempt beards, tattered cotton jackets, and grimy scarves wrapped around their heads.

"Remember," Andrew lowered his voice, "we're lost farmers. Keep your eyes downcast, hunch your shoulders when walking."

The two younger soldiers immediately hunched over, transforming into perfect images of timid country bumpkins.

"The strike team will hold position on the perimeter." Andrew did a final equipment check. "Move in the moment you see the flare signal."

As night fell, three shadows melted silently into the mountain paths. Luna stood by the window, staring at the distant silhouette of the peaks, the telegram in her hand damp with sweat.

(To be continued)
###Chapter 312: Infiltration in Disguise

Andrew Smith and his two companions squeezed into the bumpy jeep as it rumbled along the rugged mountain road, kicking up clouds of dust. The scenery outside grew increasingly desolate until the faded characters of "Luan Mountain Coal Mine" loomed in the distance under the setting sun.

"Stop here," Andrew suddenly ordered.

The deputy team leader patted his shoulder. "The mine's just ahead. This is as far as we can take you. Remember—signal immediately if anything goes wrong. Twenty of our men are waiting in these woods."

The three quickly changed into tattered cotton jackets and smeared coal dust on their faces. Andrew deliberately stuffed a tetracycline tablet into his mouth, wincing at the bitter taste.

"Move out," he muttered under his breath.

Hunching their backs, they staggered forward like real miners. The roar of trucks echoed from afar as several coal-laden vehicles barreled toward them.

"Get out of the way!" Andrew shouted in feigned panic. The three scrambled clumsily to the roadside, nearly tumbling into the ditch.

"Ha! Look at those country bumpkins!" The truck driver, River, slapped the steering wheel, honking the horn to scare them.

Hank narrowed his eyes. "Something's off. Strangers don't just show up in the middle of nowhere. Stop the truck!"

The vehicle screeched to a halt. Hank jumped down with two burly men, iron rods glinting coldly at their waists.

"What are you doing here?" Hank barked.

Andrew immediately hunched submissively. "W-we're here for work, boss. The foreman was s'posed to meet us, but..." He deliberately lisped in a thick rural accent, flashing yellowed teeth.

Hank took a half-step back in disgust. "Which village?"

"Old Liu Village, over the mountain," Andrew rubbed his hands nervously. "I'm strong, and these two listen to me." He flexed his arms for emphasis.

His teammates cowered appropriately behind him.

River leaned in. "Boss, free labor right here."

Hank hesitated, then suddenly grabbed Andrew's wrist. Andrew tensed internally but kept his dopey grin.

The callouses on Andrew's palms seemed to reassure Hank. "Fine. Waters, take them inside."

"Thank you, boss! Thank you!" The three bowed repeatedly like wide-eyed peasants.

Once the trucks were gone, Waters spat. "Follow me. No looking around!"

Passing through rusted iron gates, Andrew discreetly scanned the surroundings. Barbed wire coiled atop high walls, and snarling guard dogs were chained in corners. Patrols of armed men eyed the newcomers with suspicion.

"Old Cooper!" Waters suddenly yelled. "Get me some damn noodles!"

William, who had been carrying vegetables, looked up—and dropped his basket with a clatter. Cabbages rolled everywhere.

"You asking for a beating?" Waters kicked him.

Andrew's pupils contracted—the beaten young man was exactly the missing college student they'd been searching for.

"You three," Waters turned and ordered, "haul these inside. Slack off, and..." He meaningfully tapped his iron rod.

Andrew nodded eagerly, seizing the chance to exchange a glance with William. A flicker of hope flashed in the young man's eyes before he quickly lowered his head.

From the depths of the mine, faint cries of agony drifted out. Andrew clenched his fists. This was no coal mine—it was a living hell.
###Chapter 313: Warming by the Fire

Andrew Smith and his two companions nodded in agreement. Old Harold Cooper patted William Cooper's shoulder. "William, you take charge of moving the supplies. I'll prepare a meal for Mr. Waters. Don't slack off!"

William straightened his back. "Yes, sir!"

Sean Waters leaned against the kitchen window, cigarette dangling from his lips as he exhaled smoke through the narrow opening. Through the curling haze, he watched the three country men laboring with the grain sacks, a cold smirk playing on his lips.

By the stove, Old Harold deftly rolled out dough for noodles. Soon, a steaming bowl of egg noodles was placed before Waters.

"Take your time, sir. I'll go help with the supplies," Old Harold said respectfully.

Waters slurped the noodles and waved dismissively. "Stay put, old man. Keep me company." His rare moment of kindness stemmed solely from the noodles suiting his taste.

Old Harold thanked him profusely and huddled by the stove to chat.

Meanwhile, William and Andrew carried sacks of flour, using them as cover for hushed conversation.

"Captain Smith, why are you here?" William's voice trembled. He never dreamed he'd encounter Luna White's fiancé in this place.

Andrew studied the gaunt young man before him. The William he remembered had been shy but bright-eyed. Now, he was hunched over, as if drained of all vitality.

"Luna received your message," Andrew murmured behind the flour sack. "We're here to assess the situation."

William's eyes welled up. He hadn't expected Sally to deliver the message, let alone for help to arrive so swiftly.

"This is an illegal coal mine..." William whispered urgently, pouring out everything he'd witnessed over the past six months. By the end, he was nearly frantic. "You shouldn't have come! There are over thirty armed thugs here—all ruthless criminals!"

Andrew adjusted the flour sack calmly. "Don't worry. Our men are nearby."

Only then did William relax slightly.

As they spoke, Waters' roar came from the kitchen. "Quit dawdling! Finish before I'm done eating!"

"Almost finished!" William called back obsequiously, seizing the chance to relay the mine's layout in detail.

Over a hundred deceived farmers were imprisoned here. The mine shaft was like a gaping maw—those who entered either worked themselves to death or were beaten to death, their bodies disappearing into abandoned tunnels.

As they moved the last sack, Waters emerged, wiping his mouth. "Follow me."

Suddenly, Andrew strode toward the stove. "It's freezing outside. Let's warm up first."

Waters' face darkened. He snatched up the fire poker. "You dare disobey me?"

The poker whistled through the air, but Andrew dodged effortlessly. In the firelight, the three soldiers exchanged knowing smiles.

"Come warm yourselves," Andrew said, flexing his wrists. "It's time to get comfortable."

Old Harold promptly ducked under the table, covering his head. Waters swung the poker wildly, but a kick to his knee sent him crashing to the ground. Before he could rise, the fire poker was at his throat.

"Now," Andrew pressed a foot to Waters' back, "let's discuss who's really in charge here."
###Chapter 314: Terrified Out of Their Wits

The two thugs hunched their backs and tucked in their necks, looking like beaten quails.

Sean Waters swung the fire poker down with force, only to hear a loud crack—the poker snapped in half.

He gaped in disbelief.

The poker was thicker than his arm, and he hadn’t even used that much strength. How had it broken?

If the poker had shattered, then the man must be—Sean frantically looked down.

The young man he had struck straightened up, stretched lazily, and dusted the flour off his clothes. "Bro, did you skip breakfast? That felt like a tickle."

The other man burst into laughter.

Only then did Sean realize—it wasn’t the poker’s fault. These men had real skills!

He opened his mouth to shout.

A hand like an iron vise clamped around his throat instantly.

"Make a sound, and I’ll snap your neck," the young man said coldly.

Sean stared in horror as the man drove five fingers straight through the fire poker, leaving five gaping holes.

William Cooper caught a whiff of something foul. He glanced down—Sean’s pants were soaked, and a puddle had formed beneath him.

The thug who had once bullied others was now pissing himself in fear.

"Ah—!" Sean’s eyes rolled back, and he collapsed unconscious.

"Disgusting," the young man muttered, tossing him aside. "Find some rope and tie him up. Gag him too."

William quickly said, "There’s some in the storage room. I’ll get it."

Old Harold trembled in fear. William reassured him, "Don’t worry. They’re here to save us."

Andrew Smith observed the situation outside. Most of the thugs were gathered near the mine shaft, leaving the main gate lightly guarded.

"Send the signal," he ordered firmly. "The three of us will rush the gate, take out the guards, and open it. It’ll take them a minute to get here from the mine—we need to move fast."

The two soldiers snapped to attention and saluted. "Yes, Captain!"

Just as the three armed themselves and prepared to move, William returned with the rope.

"Where are you going?"

"To let our people in. You and Old Harold hide in the storage room and lock the door."

William panicked. "Three of you aren’t enough! Send the signal first!"

Andrew shook his head. "The gate’s locked, and the walls are wired. If we don’t open it from inside, forcing an entry will cost lives."

Finally understanding, William grabbed a fire poker. "I’m coming with you!"

"You can’t," Andrew said gently but firmly. "Staying safe is how you help us."

William looked down at his frail frame and reluctantly gave in. "Be careful!"

A flare shot into the sky, cutting through the darkness.

William pulled Old Harold into the storage room and peered out the window.

"William, can we trust these men?" Old Harold fretted.

"Relax. They’re professionals." Suddenly, William remembered something. "Damn it! Sean’s still in the kitchen!"

He moved to drag the unconscious thug inside.

Old Harold stopped him. "Don’t go out there! It’s chaos!"

The two pressed against the window, but all they could see were blurred figures locked in combat.

William silently prayed: Andrew, please stay safe...
###Chapter 315: Bribery

The flare pierced the sky as three military trucks roared toward the mining area, their tires kicking up clouds of dust over the gravel road.

"Faster! Step on it!" The soldier in the passenger seat white-knuckled the handrail.

As they neared the mining compound's gates, the iron doors creaked open, revealing Andrew Smith waving urgently. "Watch out! They've got guard dogs and machetes!"

Twelve fully armed SWAT officers leaped from the trucks in unison, their gun barrels glinting coldly in the sunlight.

The approaching thugs froze mid-charge. A yellow-haired gang leader dropped his steel pipe with a clang.

"C-cops!"

Someone's panicked shout sent the crowd scattering like startled birds. Several men scrambled toward the office building to sound the alarm.

Upstairs, Victor Shaw had just hung up the phone when gunfire erupted. His thick lips trembled as he mopped his shiny forehead with a silk handkerchief.

"Boss, the place is swarming with armed police—" His secretary burst in breathlessly.

Victor tossed his phone onto the leather sofa. "Calm down. I'll handle this."

When the elevator doors opened, Andrew was inventorying detained thugs. Heavy footsteps approached.

"Who's in charge here?" Victor adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his beer belly leading the way.

Andrew stepped forward. "Captain Andrew Smith, SWAT Unit."

"My, what an impressive young captain." Victor suddenly draped an arm over Andrew's shoulder. "Care for a private word?"

Andrew sidestepped the gesture. "Speak plainly."

The smile stiffened on Victor's face. As he straightened his tie, he slipped a bulging envelope into Andrew's pocket. "For your men's trouble... just some refreshment funds—"

"Evidence team!" Andrew barked.

A gloved officer rushed over. Andrew produced the envelope. "Log this as Exhibit A."

Victor's face purpled. "Captain Smith, don't burn bridges. My cousin is deputy director at the Provincial—"

"Note that down," Andrew told the recorder. "Attempted bribery and threatening law enforcement."

Just then, the mine elevator screeched to life, bringing up thirty-odd miners in tattered clothes. Their hollow eyes welled with tears at the sight of police vehicles and armed officers.

Sirens wailed as three prosecutor's sedans skidded to a stop. Polished dress shoes stepped onto the coal-dusted ground.

"Mr. Shaw." The lead prosecutor flashed his badge. "You'll need to come with us."
###Chapter 316: I Can Testify

The wail of police sirens pierced the sky.

A dozen squad cars screeched to a halt, doors flying open as armed officers formed a perimeter. Boss Xu's face drained of color, sweat beading on his forehead.

"CID Unit," announced the lead detective, flashing his badge. "We've received reports of illegal confinement and assault."

Boss Xu's knees buckled. He'd greased plenty of palms, but these were city investigators. His eyes darted toward Andrew Smith, who was calmly adjusting his cuffs.

"Perfect timing, Officer." Andrew stepped forward. "We're investigating missing persons when these men blocked us—armed."

Boss Xu's beady eyes narrowed before he lunged at Andrew. "Lies! He's extorting me!" He pointed at the file in Andrew's hand. "That's hush money he demanded!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Brothers!" Boss Xu turned to the miners. "In your hearts—have I ever wronged you?"

The coal yard fell deathly silent. Workers stared at the ground, fingers twisting their tattered shirts.

Boss Xu smirked. "You see, Officer—"

"I can testify."

A raspy voice cut through. William Cooper emerged supporting Old Harold, who clutched bloodied bandages. William's fire poker bore dark stains.

"Five years..." Old Harold trembled. "I've watched how many get tossed into abandoned shafts..."

Boss Xu turned ashen. "They're framing me!"

"Me too!" A gaunt figure pushed forward. "My brother died down there last month!"

Like a dam breaking, miners surged forward.

"I saw them beat Old Walter to death!"
"We've never been paid!"
"The electric fences... the attack dogs..."

The outcry swelled. Someone hurled a coal chunk at Boss Xu, sparking a hailstorm of justice long overdue.

Andrew retreated, murmuring to the detective, "Evidence is all in here."

Boss Xu collapsed, his designer suit blackened. As the miners' fury crested, realization struck—no connections could save him now.
###Chapter 317: Reunion

"Wrap it up!"

At Andrew Smith's command, Captain Zhang from the city's Criminal Investigation Unit strode over to shake hands in farewell. The wail of police sirens filled the air as Boss Xu and over a dozen thugs were loaded into squad cars, their handcuffs glinting coldly in the sunlight.

"We couldn't have done it without you," Captain Zhang said, clapping Andrew on the shoulder.

The rescued miners were being escorted to military trucks, bound for the hospital under armed police guard. The coal mine's entrance had already been sealed, with several police vehicles parked near the shaft as forensic teams combed the scene.

"Initial estimates put the death toll at over thirty," Captain Zhang said grimly. "This case will make national headlines."

Andrew nodded. Who would have thought a simple missing persons investigation would uncover such a massive crime? He raised his walkie-talkie: "All units, after escorting the workers to the Armed Police Hospital, return immediately for debriefing."

The third-floor hallway of the Armed Police Hospital was packed. Luna White led Henry Cooper through the crowd, passing a nurse's station where registration forms overflowed with names.

"Bed 307, William Cooper," the nurse said after a glance. "Third room around the corner."

The door was ajar, revealing a cacophony of voices inside. A dozen beds were crammed close together—some men recounted their ordeals loudly, others wiped away tears, and a few had already fallen asleep.

By the window, William Cooper lay motionless, staring at the ceiling. He'd been luckier than most, working in the kitchen where at least he'd been fed. But the light in his eyes seemed to have been swallowed by the mine's darkness.

"Will!"

Henry's shout made William bolt upright. His lips parted, but no sound came out. Luna noticed the fading rope burns still visible on his wrists.

"Don't move, don't move," Henry said, pressing his brother back down with trembling hands. "You've... you've lost so much weight..."

Luna set a net bag on the bedside table—malted milk powder, canned fruit, sponge cakes... Henry had nearly cleared out the general store. As she pulled up a chair, she spotted coal dust still embedded under William's fingernails.

"Have you been examined by a doctor?"

William shook his head, then nodded. His gaze darted away, avoiding Luna's eyes. A sudden burst of sobbing erupted across the ward as one miner called his family.

"I... I'm sorry..." William rasped, his voice like sandpaper. "I just wanted to earn money to pay the debts..."

Henry pulled his brother into a crushing embrace, the usually stoic man weeping like a child. Luna slipped into the hallway and texted Andrew.

Sunlight streamed through the window, bleaching the hospital sheets white. Those dark years had finally been shaken loose like coal dust, scattered into the light.
###Chapter 318: Vision

The chatter in the hospital room gradually quieted as all eyes turned to William Cooper. The gazes of those present were filled with envy—someone had actually come all this way just to visit him.

"You two catch up. I'll go check with the doctor," Luna White said tactfully, rising to her feet. She could tell William became as stiff as a child caught misbehaving whenever she was around.

Before leaving, she couldn't resist glancing back at him. This young man had surprised her. Henry had told her William had left home to repay her for saving his life—to earn money for her dowry and protect her.

Yet in the end, she'd ended up rescuing him again.

Warmth bloomed in Luna's chest, but seeing William's nervous demeanor, she wondered: Had she been too harsh?

The moment the door closed, William exhaled in relief.

"What's with you? You act like Luna's some kind of ghost," Henry teased as he poured water for his brother. The enamel mugs in the room were standard issue—this mining disaster had alarmed provincial authorities, and all victims' medical expenses were being covered by the police.

Who could have imagined over thirty bodies had been buried in that illegal mine? Now the ringleader, Boss Victor Shaw, had been arrested, along with Hank Miller, who'd previously evaded capture.

"Bro, I'm just ashamed to face her," William muttered, running a hand through his hair. "Came here to repay her, only to get rescued by her again..."

Henry glared. "You're lucky Luna's fiancé, Instructor Andrew Smith, stepped in. What good would my telegram have done alone? I told you not to go running off! Couldn't you repay her by working hard back home?"

His voice cracked mid-sentence. He'd nearly lost his little brother forever.

"Henry, I'm fine," William said, gripping his brother's trembling hand. "A man's got to see the world. How else do you gain perspective without facing hardships?"

"Perspective?" Henry snapped. "What were you going to do out here? Should've stayed and learned trucking with me! Transport pays well these days—"

"Henry!" William cut him off. "I'm not a kid anymore. Surviving this... I know exactly what I want now."

Outside the door, Luna listened quietly, her lips curving unconsciously. This barely-educated young man had broader horizons than most college graduates. To self-rescue in such dire circumstances—William was truly remarkable.

She pushed the door open, and both brothers fell silent.

"William," Luna got straight to the point. "Who sent that distress telegram for you?"

William brightened. "I was just about to tell you! A girl named Sally Wilson helped me. Dr. White, could you thank her for me?"

Luna shook her head. "We'll go together tomorrow when you're discharged. That kind of debt deserves personal gratitude."

It struck her how many good people she'd met since her reincarnation. This world felt less frigid than her previous life.

"Don't call me Dr. White," she said with a smile. "We're family now. What saved you wasn't me—it was your own courage."

William's ears turned red like a praised schoolboy.

As she left, Luna arranged with Henry to pick them up the next day. Turning away, she caught the determined glint in William's eyes—this young man would go far.
###Chapter 319: An Unexpected Visit

Luna White had just pushed open the hospital doors when the nurse at the station called out to her.

"Dr. White, someone's been waiting in your office all afternoon."

Puzzled, she headed toward the examination room. The moment she opened the door, a familiar figure rushed toward her.

"Luna!"

Lily Clark, cheerful as a songbird, threw her arms around Luna's. Luna's eyes widened—what was this girl doing here?

"You ran away?" Luna's voice rose sharply.

Lily stuck out her tongue, swinging Luna's arm playfully. "I missed you, that's all!"

Luna rolled her eyes in exasperation. Mayor George and Clara Clark doted on their daughter like she was their most precious treasure—there was no way they'd let her travel this far alone.

"Hungry?" Luna sighed in resignation.

Lily immediately clutched her stomach dramatically. "Starving! I almost got kidnapped by traffickers on the way—scared me so much I didn't dare stop to eat."

Jack poked his head in. "Dr. White, should we keep the afternoon appointments?"

Luna waved a hand. "Cancel them for me."

David Moore readily approved a week's leave. The Traditional Medicine Department wasn't short-staffed, and while Luna's acupuncture was well-regarded, her absence wouldn't disrupt operations.

On the way back to the dormitory, Lily gaped at everything like she'd stepped into a wonderland.

The moment they entered, she froze in place.

A 32-inch color TV, a double-door refrigerator, a leather sofa... These were appliances she couldn't even dream of back in the village, yet Luna had them all.

Suddenly self-conscious, she twisted the hem of her shirt. "Luna, I... I should go find a job that provides room and board."

Luna, busy in the kitchen, flicked her forehead. "Nonsense!"

A steaming bowl of noodles with a golden fried egg on top brought sudden tears to Lily's eyes.

"I'm calling your parents," Luna picked up the receiver.

Lily jumped in panic. "Don't!"

"You want them to worry sick?" Luna glared. "Last time you disappeared, your mother cried herself half-blind."

Defeated, Lily quietly recited her home number.

As the call connected, Luna noticed something she'd never seen before—this fearless girl's fingers were trembling.
###Chapter 320: Resolving Heart Knots

"Ring— Ring—"

The moment the call connected, Luna White could sense the tension draining from Mayor George Clark's voice.

"Luna, this girl has given us such a scare!" His voice was heavy with exhaustion. "She left a note and ran off, saying she was going to find work. Her mother hasn't stopped crying for two days..."

Lily Clark hovered by the phone, ears perked.

Luna glanced at her before speaking softly, "Uncle George, don't worry. Lily is safe here with me."

"Thank goodness." He exhaled in relief. "Her mother and I will come get her tomorrow. This child is so reckless—"

Lily stomped her foot in frustration, shooting Luna pleading looks.

"Uncle George," Luna interjected, "I think... it might be better if Lily stays with me for now."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"Listen," Luna chose her words carefully. "Lily's an adult now, and she's finished high school. Instead of forcing her into an early marriage back in the village, why not let her explore opportunities here in the city? The provincial capital has so much more to offer—"

"But..." George's voice trembled. "After what happened with Harold Martin..."

"I understand your concern," Luna softened her tone. "But you can't keep her sheltered forever. Lily's smart—she won't repeat the same mistakes."

A weighted sigh traveled through the line.

"You're right, Luna." His voice suddenly sounded older. "This girl's stubborn as a mule. Even if we drag her back, she'll just run off again..."

Lily's eyes reddened instantly.

Luna silently handed her the receiver and turned to clear the dining table.

"Dad..." Lily's voice cracked on the first word.

"You foolish girl!" George scolded, but his own tears came first. "Do you have any idea how worried your mother's been?"

"I'm sorry..." Lily's tears fell freely. "I just... didn't want to spend my whole life trapped in the village..."

The line went quiet for several seconds.

"How... how did you even find Luna alone?" George suddenly asked.

Lily wiped her cheeks. "I—I followed the address and asked for directions..."

"You didn't get lost?"

"Not once!" Her voice brightened. "Dad, the city is enormous! There are skyscrapers everywhere, movie theaters, department stores..."

As Lily animatedly described her discoveries, George's tone gradually softened.

"Child..." He sighed deeply. "I never wanted to hold you back. I just feared you'd get hurt..."

"I know." Lily sniffled. "Dad, I promise—I've really grown up this time."

Simultaneous silence settled between them.

"Come home... for New Year's." That was all George finally said.

"Yes! I will!" Lily nodded vigorously as if he could see her.

After hanging up, Lily stood frozen in place. She realized then that the words she'd struggled to voice, the knots she thought would never loosen—all it took was one honest conversation.

Luna handed her a steaming cup of tea. "Everything settled?"

Lily accepted the cup, the warmth seeping into her fingers making her eyes sting again. "Yes. Everything's settled."

She understood now—her parents' love had never been chains, but the sturdiest safety net she could ever have.
###Chapter 321: The Phone Call

Luna White arranged for Lily Clark to stay in her room. There was no need for the two girls to sleep separately.

That afternoon, she took Lily to the workers' communal bathhouse. It was Lily's first time seeing so many people bathing together, and she blushed furiously, clutching the hem of her shirt. Back in the village, she only bathed once a month, using a wooden basin to scrub herself hastily.

"So many people... undressed..." Lily's voice trembled.

Luna chuckled and pulled her inside. "Don't be shy. It's all women here."

When the warm water cascaded over her head, Lily's eyes widened in surprise. This was far more comfortable than the wooden basin at home. The female workers around them chatted and laughed, scrubbing each other's backs in a relaxed, carefree atmosphere.

"Use this." Luna handed her a bottle of Seagull shampoo.

Lily accepted it gingerly. The lather flowed through her hair, carrying a faint floral scent. Then came the yellow conditioner, smoothing her strands effortlessly.

After the bath, Lily's hair had never felt so soft. The comb glided from roots to ends without a single tangle—unlike before, when every stroke had made her wince in pain.

"The soap smells so nice," Lily murmured, sniffing her arm with a delighted smile.

They spent over an hour in the bathhouse before leaving. Luna paid with bath coupons, and they walked back with damp hair.

Exhausted from her day-long train journey, Lily went to bed early. Having eaten at two in the afternoon, she skipped dinner and fell asleep the moment her head touched the pillow.

Around eight in the evening, Luna quietly picked up the phone. She hadn't wanted to disturb Andrew Smith during work hours, but now was the perfect time.

"Hello?" The familiar voice answered.

"I was just about to call you," Andrew replied, amusement in his tone.

Luna kept her voice low. "What a coincidence."

"Call it telepathy," he teased—a rare moment of playfulness from the usually serious captain.

"Since when did Captain Smith learn to sweet-talk?" Luna muffled a laugh.

"Why are you whispering?"

"Lily's asleep," she explained. "The mayor's daughter."

Andrew remembered instantly. "The girl we rescued last time?"

On her end of the line, Luna gazed at the peacefully sleeping Lily, her lips curving into an unconscious smile. Moonlight streamed through the window, casting a silvery glow over the room.
###Chapter 322: Heartfelt Reminders

"You actually remembered?" Luna White sounded surprised.

"I never forget anything about you."

The simple yet sincere words warmed Luna's heart. What woman wouldn't want to feel special in her lover's eyes?

"Such smooth talk! Captain Smith, mind your military decorum!"

"How's William doing? He seemed in good spirits earlier with no visible injuries—nothing serious, I hope?" Andrew Smith deftly changed the subject. He wasn't one for sweet nothings; when he spoke from the heart, it was always genuine, never calculated.

"He'll be discharged tomorrow. I plan to have him stay at my place temporarily. The camp bed from last time is still there—we'll set it up in the living room. My brother-in-law will be eager to return home after wrapping up his business; there's plenty waiting for him there."

"Two grown men staying at your place isn't ideal. Should I arrange accommodations for them at the guesthouse?" Andrew frowned. Luna's sister's home was already cramped, and the restaurant would be too cold at night—there really weren't better options.

"Don't trouble yourself. It's just for a few days. William is sensitive—making a fuss might make him uncomfortable." Luna saw things clearly. Given William's personality, he'd likely leave on his own soon enough.

"'That kid'? He's several years older than you." Andrew couldn't help but chuckle. Luna's matronly tone made it seem like she viewed William as a junior.

"My mistake—'that gentleman,'" Luna corrected, smacking her forehead in frustration. She had a habit of treating others like they needed her care—a tendency she needed to curb.

"I won't be able to pick you up tomorrow. I have to report to the district office and won't be back for at least three days. Take care of yourself, especially with your chronic condition. I worry when I'm not around."

"You take care too. By the way... will this incident affect you?" Luna finally voiced the concern weighing on her. Though she knew seeking Andrew's help might have been improper, her first thought upon receiving the telegram was that there might be protectors behind the scenes.

"Don't worry, I'm fine. I'll come straight to you when I return." Andrew's voice softened. Some things couldn't be shared yet, but far from causing trouble, this operation had earned him major commendations for cracking a significant case. His superiors had already hinted that his promotion next month was practically guaranteed.


###Chapter 323: Sally's Secret

The morning sun had just begun to stream through the window when Lily Clark tugged at Luna White's arm excitedly. "Luna, take me to pick up William! I can't wait to meet the hero!"

Luna swayed slightly from the force of Lily's enthusiasm. "Alright, alright. But he just got discharged from the hospital—don't overwhelm him."

"I promise!" Lily raised three fingers, her eyes sparkling. "I just admire him so much! If it were me, I'd have been too scared to even speak, let alone think of a way to call for help!"

At the hospital, William Cooper had already packed his few belongings. When the nurse handed him his discharge papers, she gave him an extra glance. "You're the young man who outsmarted those kidnappers, aren't you? Truly remarkable."

Fellow patients in the ward cast admiring looks his way. A bespectacled middle-aged man sighed. "William, if you hadn't stepped up that day, who knows what would've happened to the rest of us."

William smiled bashfully, though his gaze kept drifting toward the door.

"Waiting for your girlfriend?" a patient teased.

"No, it's—" Before he could finish, Luna and Lily walked in.

After completing the discharge formalities, the group had just reached the hospital entrance when William suddenly stopped. "Luna, I want to visit Sally today."

Luna glanced at the bags Henry was carrying. "Henry, why don't you head back first? William and I will go to Sally's place."

Lily immediately clung to Luna's arm. "I'm coming too! I won't cause any trouble!" She leaned in and whispered, "I can't miss something this exciting."

Henry shook his head in resignation. "Just come back early." Before leaving, he gave his younger brother's shoulder a reassuring squeeze, pride evident in his eyes.

The taxi twisted through narrow alleys before stopping in front of a row of low, weathered houses. Faded red slogans about "safety in production" still clung to the peeling walls.

"This is it?" Lily's eyes widened—clearly, she hadn't expected their savior to live in such humble conditions.

Luna stepped forward and knocked. A wary female voice called out from inside, "Who is it?"

"We're here to see Sally."

The door cracked open, revealing a face with carefully applied makeup. The moment the girl spotted William, her expression twisted, and she immediately tried to slam the door shut.

Luna reacted swiftly, wedging her foot against it. "Victor and the others have been arrested. The police will protect you."

The resistance against the door weakened. After a tense silence, it slowly creaked open. "Come in."

The interior was so dim it took a moment for their eyes to adjust. Thick coal smoke hung in the air, making Lily cough. As their vision cleared, the scene inside came into focus: a battered wooden sofa, chipped enamel mugs, and an emaciated middle-aged woman lying on a bed in the inner room.

Sally stood by the bed, fingers nervously twisting the hem of her shirt. "What... do you want from me?"
###Chapter 324: Redemption

"Lily, do we have visitors?" A frail voice came from the hospital bed.

Sally quickly wiped the tear stains from the corners of her eyes and turned around with a bright smile. "Mom, my friend came to see you."

The elderly woman's cloudy eyes lit up. "How wonderful... Lily finally has friends." She struggled to prop herself up with trembling hands. "This poor girl has had such a hard life, all because of my illness..."

"Auntie!" Luna White stepped forward swiftly to support the old woman, placing the fruit she had brought on the bedside table. "Sally is amazing. We all adore her."

William Cooper stood by the doorway, surveying the cramped rental apartment. The walls were peeling, the furniture worn-out, and the only thing of value seemed to be the second-hand dialysis machine in the corner.

"Our Lily used to rank in the top three in her grade..." The old woman clutched Luna's hand, her bony fingers like withered branches. "It's all because her father passed so early, and then I..."

"Mom!" Sally suddenly interrupted, the tips of her ears turning red. She turned to Luna, her heavily made-up eyes flashing with stubborn defiance. "If you're bored, you can wait outside."

Luna didn't move. Her gaze fell on the faded family photo on the bedside table—a younger Sally with a high ponytail, her smile so bright it was almost painful to look at.

"I'm a military doctor," Luna said abruptly. "I can try acupuncture."

Sally's hands, painted with bright red nail polish, clenched tightly. "It's useless. Even the specialists at Union Hospital said—"

"Three sessions," Luna interrupted, opening her acupuncture kit. The silver needles glinted coldly in the sunlight. "We'll start with the first one today."

The room fell so silent that the rhythmic beeping of the dialysis machine became deafening. Sally's lips trembled slightly, her thick false eyelashes casting shadows over her face.

"You... can really treat her?" Her voice was as light as a feather.

Luna nodded. "At the very least, she won't need dialysis anymore."

The old woman suddenly coughed, and Sally instinctively reached out to pat her back. The girl who was always so composed in nightclubs now fumbled like a helpless child.

"Let's try it," William spoke up unexpectedly. "Dr. White's acupuncture... is special."

Sally watched her mother's pained expression, her nails digging into her palms. Finally, she gave a small, hesitant nod.

As the first silver needle was inserted, the old woman suddenly let out a soft "Huh?" Sally tensed and rushed to the bedside. "Mom? Does it hurt?"

"No..." The old woman blinked in confusion. "It's... warm inside."

Luna's hands were steady as stone, the needles seeming to come alive under her fingertips. Sally stared unblinkingly at the quivering needle tips, the hope in her eyes impossible to hide beneath her makeup.

"Can she... really get better?" she murmured, as if asking Luna—or perhaps fate itself.

Outside the window, the setting sun dipped below the horizon. The last golden ray slipped through the curtains, landing perfectly on the old woman's gradually smoothing forehead.
###Chapter 325: Persuasion

"No!" William Cooper shot up from his chair, the legs scraping harshly against the floor.

Sally Wilson flinched at his sudden movement, ash tumbling from the cigarette between her fingers.

"Are you insane?" She frowned, shooting Luna White a skeptical glance. "Even specialists from the provincial capital couldn't help my mother. What makes you think she can?"

William took a deep breath and rolled up his pant leg, revealing a jagged scar across his knee.

"See this?" His voice trembled. "Three years ago, I couldn't even turn over in bed without help."

Sally's cigarette dropped to the floor.

"That's impossible..." she murmured, her gaze tracing the muscular contours of his calf.

"Ask any neighbor—they'll tell you about the Cooper boy who was bedridden for over a decade." William lowered his pant leg, his voice grave. "Dr. White is the reason I can walk again."

Luna stood quietly nearby, her silver acupuncture needles glinting faintly between her fingers.

An abrupt coughing fit seized the frail old woman on the bed. Her bony fingers clutched at her daughter's sleeve. "Lily...let the doctor try..."

"Mom!" Sally's eyes reddened.

"This old body of mine..." The woman wheezed. "Consider it practice for the young doctor."

Silence settled over the room. Outside, a street vendor's cry only accentuated the stillness within.

Suddenly, William dropped to one knee, meeting Sally at eye level. "Give us three days. If there's no improvement, I'll pay for all your mother's medical expenses."

Sally's nails dug into her palms. She looked into her mother's clouded eyes—eyes that held nothing but weary resignation.

"Fine." The word came out through clenched teeth.

Luna unfurled her acupuncture kit, the needles catching the light with a cold gleam. "I'll need privacy."

Understanding, William guided Sally toward the door. As it closed, he cast one last glance at the skeletal figure trembling beneath the sheets—a woman awaiting judgment from fate itself.
###Chapter 326: A Life-Saving Favor

Grandma Eleanor sprang up from the bed like a fish leaping out of water, startling Sally so badly she nearly toppled from her chair.

"Mom! You... how..." Sally stammered, her eyes wide with shock.

The elderly woman's face was now flushed with vitality, bearing no trace of the frail, sickly patient she had been just minutes ago. It was hard to believe that ten minutes earlier, Grandma Eleanor had been suffering from uremia—so swollen she could barely turn over without assistance, her breathing labored.

"Don't just stand there gaping, silly girl," Grandma Eleanor chuckled, patting her daughter’s cheek affectionately.

Sally turned mechanically toward Luna White, who was huddled in the corner, wrapped tightly in a padded coat, her face alarmingly pale. Yet this seemingly fragile young woman had somehow managed to restore Grandma Eleanor—bedridden for half a year—to her feet in mere minutes.

Before anyone could react, Grandma Eleanor threw off the blankets and swung her bare feet onto the floor.

"Mom, don’t—!" Sally cried, lunging forward.

But Grandma Eleanor was already standing steadily, striding toward Luna with surprising vigor. Sally’s heart pounded—her mother hadn’t walked unaided in six months, needing support even for trips to the bathroom.

"Dr. White!" Grandma Eleanor suddenly dropped to her knees with a thud. "You’re an angel sent to save us!"

Luna jolted at the unexpected gesture, hastily reaching to pull the older woman up. But Grandma Eleanor was stubbornly strong, refusing to budge.

"Auntie, please get up!" Luna pleaded, stamping her foot in frustration before turning to the stunned Sally. "Help me!"

Snapping out of her daze, Sally rushed over, and together they hauled Grandma Eleanor back onto the bed.

"Dr. White, your skills are nothing short of miraculous..." Grandma Eleanor babbled gratefully.

Just as Luna let out a relieved sigh, a loud thud echoed through the room.

Sally had dropped to her knees on the concrete floor and was now kowtowing—three resounding bows that shook the ground beneath them.

"Oh, for heaven’s sake!" Luna nearly jumped out of her skin. Her body was already weak and trembling from the strain of healing; she couldn’t handle this kind of shock.

The door burst open as Lily Clark and William Cooper rushed in, just in time to see Sally’s forehead reddening from the force of her bows.

"Help... get her up..." Luna’s teeth chattered. "I need... some ginger tea..."

William yanked Sally to her feet in one swift motion, then barked at the still-dazed woman, "Boil some water! Dr. White’s drained from the treatment!"

Lily had already dragged a chair near the coal stove and was guiding Luna into it. William stoked the fire, and warmth quickly filled the room.

Luna pulled her coat tighter, staring blankly at the flames. The mother and daughter’s gratitude was overwhelming—she’d nearly been scared out of her wits.
###Chapter 327: Shared Lunch

When Sally dropped Luna White, William Cooper, and Lily Clark at the hospital entrance, Luna specifically reminded her, "Bring your mother back for a follow-up in five days. Two more acupuncture sessions should fully restore her health."

Sally nodded repeatedly, her eyes glistening. "Dr. White, I promise I'll bring her on time. I'd do anything to see her well again."

By the time the trio returned to their dormitory, it was already noon. Luna glanced at the wall clock and said to Lily, "Grab the lunchboxes and pot. Let's head to the cafeteria. Everyone must be starving after this morning."

The aroma of food wafted through the cafeteria. Lily studied Luna's pale complexion and said with concern, "Luna, you're exhausted, aren't you? I saw your hands shaking while treating that elderly woman."

Luna forced a weak smile. "I'll be fine after some rest."

After collecting their meals, the four gathered around a small table. Lily's gaze lingered on Luna's gaunt face, and suddenly, her eyes welled up. "Luna... was it even harder when you saved me back then?"

Luna paused mid-bite. "That's in the past. No need to bring it up."

But Lily stubbornly scooped a large portion of braised pork into Luna's bowl. "Eat more. You're so thin—a strong breeze could knock you over."

Luna quickly blocked her from adding more. "That's enough. You all need to eat too." She served each of them a spoonful of meat. "Don't just focus on me. Meals taste better when shared."

William had been silently devouring his food. Noticing this, Luna asked, "William, what are your plans now? Returning home or staying in the city?"

He set down his chopsticks, hesitating. "I... I want to stay and find work."

Luna nodded. It was 1986—the early days of economic reform, ripe with opportunities. She silently resolved to help him. These were good, loyal people; aiding them was akin to aiding herself.

The thought of Kelsey Shaw's sudden reappearance sent a chill down Luna's spine. The tragedies of her past life must never repeat. She needed to strengthen her influence quickly. Though Shawn Johnson was reliable, their relationship was transactional at its core. Andrew Smith might be sincere, but who could guarantee history wouldn't repeat itself?

"William, I have an idea—" Luna began, only to be interrupted by a knock at the door.

An unexpected visitor stood outside.
###Chapter 328: Hitting the Wall

Luna White gazed out the window at the bustling crowd, a faint smile playing on her lips. The Spicy Hotpot restaurant owned by her sister Luna and brother-in-law Ryan Wallace was thriving under her discreet guidance. At this rate, opening new branches was only a matter of time.

"Just a few more business strategies..." Luna tapped the table lightly, her eyes gleaming with shrewd calculation. She could already envision the White family's signboard spreading across the nation. In this era when the food industry was still in its infancy, seizing the opportunity meant controlling the market.

Her gaze drifted to William Cooper. The young man had surprised her. Trapped in that hellish illegal coal mine, he'd not only kept his cool but waited for the right moment to act. What was rarer—he understood gratitude.

"I plan to find work at a construction site first," William's voice interrupted her thoughts. "Just need food and lodging. The pay doesn't matter."

Henry Cooper hesitated, eyeing his younger brother's frail frame with concern. Construction work was brutal—but he knew William wouldn't listen to reason now.

"Let him hit the wall," Henry sighed inwardly. "He won't turn back until he's tried."

Luna arched an eyebrow. Setting down her teacup with a crisp clink, she brought silence to the room.

"William," she said, meeting his eyes directly, "in your current condition, you'd struggle to carry bricks. Even if you found work, you wouldn't last a week."

William pressed his lips stubbornly, though his eyes flickered. He knew Luna was right—yet giving up wasn't an option.

"I... I can take it slow," he muttered, his voice dropping.

Luna shook her head lightly, tracing circles on the table. "Rather than wasting time at construction sites, why not..."

She deliberately drew out the pause, watching William's shoulders tense as a knowing smile curved her lips.
###Chapter 329: A Glimmer of Opportunity

"Luna, you mean..." William Cooper's eyes flickered with disappointment. He had expected her to echo others' advice—to return to their small town for a stable life.

Setting down her teacup, Luna's eyes sparkled. "The policies have loosened now. People down south are already making fortunes in business."

"Those trendy gadgets from Shanghai and Shenzhen? They sell like hotcakes here," she whispered, leaning closer. "Dr. Miller's friend makes thousands per trip just by reselling digital watches and bell-bottom jeans from Shenzhen."

William's fingers absently tapped the table as he listened intently.

"There's more," Luna continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial tone. "There's this village called Wucheng where every household makes clothes and socks. One guy brought back two sacks of stockings—sold out in two days."

A slow fire kindled in William's gaze.

"You're sharp. Why break your back at construction sites?" Luna met his eyes earnestly. "Small trades are easier and far more profitable."

William flushed, realizing he'd misjudged her. She wasn't looking down on him—she was genuinely plotting his success.

"But..." He rubbed his palms, hesitating.

Luna saw through him instantly. "Worried about capital?"

His head dipped in shame. Penniless and unwilling to burden his brother, the unspoken truth hung heavy.

"I've got you covered." Luna turned to her drawer and produced a passbook. "Two thousand dollars. Use this as seed money."

"I can't!" William recoiled as if burned.

Henry Cooper protested, "Luna, we can't accept this!"

"Consider it an investment, brother-in-law." She pressed the passbook into William's trembling hands. "I believe in you."

The weight in his palm wasn't just currency—it was unshakable trust.

"I..." His throat tightened. "I won't let you down."

Luna smiled. "Then it's settled. Tomorrow I'll introduce you to a friend who knows the southern routes—he'll give you pointers."

Outside, the setting sun stretched their three shadows long across the floor. Gazing at the horizon, William felt something unfamiliar—the future, suddenly within reach.
###Chapter 330: Help in Times of Need

"Brother-in-law, instead of begging around for loans, why not borrow from me?" Luna White pressed her slender fingers lightly on the bankbook, a sly smile in her eyes. "This isn't charity—it comes with interest. I believe in you, but the path ahead is yours to walk."

Henry Cooper rubbed his hands anxiously, his dark face flushing red. "This isn't proper! I couldn't—"

"Deal!" William Cooper cut in abruptly, his gaze burning as he stared at Luna. "I'll write an IOU."

He saw trust in her eyes—a beam of light piercing the gloom of his life.

Luna nodded in satisfaction. "That's more like it. But don't rush into business unprepared." She counted off on her fingers, "Market trends, in-demand goods, supply channels—you need to research everything. The south is full of scammers, and you'd be alone—"

"I'm not afraid!" William clenched his fists. "I'll scout the market tomorrow. If I can't handle this much hardship, I might as well go back to hauling bricks at the construction site!"

Luna suddenly remembered something. "Oh, my sister has a storefront for rent." A shrewd glint flashed in her eyes. "If you can source directly from the south, the profits would far exceed wholesale margins."

William's eyes lit up.

Luna mentally calculated—when the time was right, that plot could be developed into a commercial hub. But for now... She glanced at William's determined expression and smiled faintly.

This young man might just carve out his own destiny.
###Chapter 331: Lily Clark's Bright Future

"Luna!" Lily slammed her chopsticks down and grabbed Luna's wrist. "You can't play favorites! We're closer than sisters. You helped William, so why won't you help me?" Her eyes reddened with urgency, voice trembling with hurt.

Luna chuckled at her dramatics, gently prying her hand loose. "Relax, finish your meal first. Do you really think I'd forget about you?"

But Lily was already on her feet, clearing the dishes with restless energy. "I'm done!" She snatched the chopsticks right from Luna's grasp.

Luna stared longingly at the remaining braised pork. "But I haven't—"

"You can eat later!" Lily glared, protective as a mother tiger guarding her cub.

With a resigned sigh, Luna shook her head at her friend's impatience.

In the kitchen, Lily scrubbed dishes with brisk efficiency, water splashing noisily.

"Luna, give it to me straight—will you help or not?" Lily bit her lip, eyes welling up again. It stung that Luna had prioritized outsiders over their bond.

Drying her hands, Luna smiled. "Who said I wasn't? I've already planned two paths for you."

Lily froze, the dishcloth dangling forgotten in her grip.

"First option: work as a shop assistant when William opens his store. Steady income, no startup costs." Luna counted on her fingers. "Second option..."

She deliberately trailed off, and Lily stamped her foot. "Out with it!"

"You're skilled at sewing. Take tailoring classes, then open your own shop." Luna's eyes sparkled. "Expand later, partner with William—he supplies fabrics, you handle production. Eventually, you could run a clothing factory."

The bowl slipped from Lily's hands, clattering into the sink.

"Really? I could own a factory?" Her voice shook.

Luna nodded. "If you're willing to work hard, absolutely."

Suddenly, Lily lunged forward, damp arms locking around Luna as she planted a loud kiss on her cheek.

"Luna! You're my lucky star!" She babbled excitedly, "From now on, you're my blood sister—I'll fight anyone who messes with you!"

Gasping for air in the crushing hug, Luna laughed and patted her back. "Easy! I wasn't finished..."
###Chapter 332: Lucky Charm

Luna White pushed Lily Clark away in disgust, vigorously wiping her face.

"Ugh, that's disgusting! If you keep this up, I'm staying far away from you. I'm not into women," she scowled.

Lily smirked and leaned in, playfully tilting Luna's chin with her finger. "Too bad, I've got my eyes on you. Whatcha gonna do about it?"

The two locked eyes before bursting into laughter.

Outside the kitchen, William Cooper pricked up his ears, startled by their boisterous laughter.

Lily suddenly sighed. "Opening a clothing store isn't that easy. You've already lent your money to William, and I can't bring myself to ask my family." She bit her lip. "Maybe I should work at the factory first to save up?"

She clenched her fists. Now that she'd left home, she was determined to make something of herself—to prove everyone back in her hometown wrong.

Luna rolled her eyes. "Don't be ridiculous. If I suggested it, did you really think I'd let you worry about money?"

Lily's eyes lit up, and she immediately scooped Luna into a spinning hug.

"Ah! Put me down! Your hands are wet!" Luna shrieked.

Lily laughed as she set her down. "I knew you'd take care of me!"

"Who was it that just accused me of not caring?" Luna huffed.

Lily nudged her playfully. "I was wrong, okay?" She lowered her voice. "Luna, you're my lucky charm. My parents were right—ever since I met you, my luck's turned around."

Luna kicked at her. "Get lost! Meeting you was the worst luck for me! First, I had to save your life, and now you're mooching off me for work too!"

"Ow!" Lily yelped dramatically. "Then I'm sticking with you for life!"

"Pfft—"

A stifled laugh came from the kitchen doorway.

Lily's face flushed red as she stormed over and yanked William's ear. "Eavesdropping on girls' talk? Have you no shame?"

William covered his mouth and fled in a panic.
###Chapter 333: Drunken Vengeance

The night in Kyoto was thick with indulgence.

Kevin Shaw sprawled across the VIP lounge’s leather couch, surrounded by his sycophantic entourage. Several scantily clad hostesses clung to him, their fingers tracing teasing patterns over his chest.

"Mr. Shaw, one more drink~" A red-haired girl pouted, pressing a glass to his lips.

He threw his head back and drained it, the icy liquor sliding down his throat—yet it did nothing to quench the fury simmering in his veins.

A month.

A whole month since his father had lashed him bloody with a belt, leaving him confined like a beaten dog. Only today had the whip marks finally scabbed over.

"Mr. Shaw is so generous!" Another girl simpered, her fingers already inching toward his bulging wallet.

Kevin sneered and flung a wad of cash into the air. Bills fluttered down like confetti, sending the women shrieking and scrambling.

His bleary gaze flicked to the two black-suited bodyguards stationed nearby—his father’s watchdogs.

The alcohol burned through him, dragging him back to that humiliating night. Luna White had not only cost him billions but turned him into a laughingstock among his peers. Worse, his father had personally apologized to her and even handed over a piece of land!

Crash!

He slammed his glass onto the table, shattering it.

"Something wrong, Mr. Shaw?" His cronies leaned in.

"Nothing." His lips twisted into a vicious grin as he cracked open another bottle of whiskey. "Tonight, we drink till we drop."

The liquor seared his stomach, sharpening his thirst for revenge. Once his father let his guard down, he’d make Luna White beg for death. So she thought Andrew Smith’s protection made her untouchable? He’d see how much the man wanted her after she was ruined.

"Again!" He tipped the bottle straight into his mouth, amber liquid spilling down his chin, soaking his shirt.

In his drunken haze, he imagined Luna on her knees, pleading. The fantasy sent dark satisfaction surging through him, and he burst into laughter.

One of the bodyguards frowned and stepped forward. "Young Master, it’s time to go."

"Piss off!" Kevin kicked over the coffee table, staggering to his feet as the women screamed. "I’m not… done drinking yet—"

Before he could finish, the world tilted. He collapsed face-first onto the couch, unconscious.

The last thing flickering through his mind was a blood-soaked plan for vengeance.
###hapter 334: Crimson Waltz

Kevin Shaw shot to his feet, his bloodshot eyes burning like twin flames.

He staggered, gripping the sofa for support as his fingers tore at his shirt collar. Buttons scattered across the floor, a few striking the glass coffee table with sharp cracks.

"Get off me!" He shoved away the woman attempting to steady him. She crashed into a floor lamp with a pained cry.

Frantically ripping off his clothes, he exposed his sweat-slicked chest and threw back his head with an animalistic roar.

Laughter died in the VIP booth.

On the dance floor, the singer continued crooning a love ballad. Couples swayed to the melody, oblivious to the disturbance.

Kevin lurched into the swirling crowd.

The sea of dancers parted. Like a rabid beast, he convulsed at the center, pounding his fists against his chest with dull thuds.

"Kevin's going wild!" His friends whistled and joined in. The music abruptly switched to deafening disco.

The entire dance floor erupted.

Then—

A bloodcurdling scream pierced the night.

The music cut off.

When security pushed through the crowd, they found Kevin curled on the floor. Blood seeped from every facial orifice, his pupils dilated and unfocused.

......

......

Sean Shaw tapped the investigation report on his desk.

New leads had emerged from Six Paths Village. Women's Committee Director Amy Miller had indeed adopted a baby girl years ago. Meanwhile, the White couple who delivered Julia Shaw's baby were expecting their own child at the time.

The puzzle deepened—Amy now had no children. Under questioning, she'd clammed up completely.

Stranger still, Luna White's records clearly identified her as the Whites' biological daughter.

Sean massaged his temples.

The threads tangled further—Luna's uncanny resemblance to Julia, Amy's vanished adopted daughter, the deceased Dr. White and his wife...

The truth remained veiled.

A sudden realization made him bolt upright. His elbow knocked over the coffee cup, dark liquid soaking the crucial report.
###Chapter 334: Bloodstained Revelry

Kevin Shaw jerked to his feet, his bloodshot eyes burning like twin flames.

Staggering, he braced himself against the sofa with one hand while the other tore at his collar. Buttons scattered across the floor, a few striking the glass coffee table with sharp cracks.

"Get off me!" He shoved away the woman attempting to steady him. She crashed into a lamp post with a pained cry.

His sweater landed in a heap as he ripped open his shirt, baring his chest. Tipping his head back, he unleashed a feral roar.

Silence swallowed their booth. Though the music pulsed on in the dance floor, everyone sensed the shift in the air.

On stage, a sequined singer swayed her hips. Couples moved to the rhythm across the dance floor.

Kevin stumbled into the center of the crowd.

"Move! All of you—out of my way!" He bulldozed through the throng. Patrons scrambled aside, avoiding the drunken madman.

His body convulsed in erratic jerks, fists pounding his own chest. His companions mistook it for performance art, whistling and joining in.

The music switched to deafening electronic beats.

The dance floor erupted. Under kaleidoscopic lights, writhing figures transformed into a pack of frenzied beasts.

A piercing scream split the night.

Music cut off abruptly. Security pushed through the gathering crowd.

Kevin curled fetal on the floor, blood oozing from every orifice. His fingers contorted at unnatural angles, pupils dilated and fixed.

............

............

Sean Shaw flipped through the latest investigation report. His desk overflowed with documents from Six Paths Village.

"Amy Miller..." He studied the women's association director's file. This childless woman had once adopted a baby girl. The delivering physician shared the White surname—his own wife pregnant at the time.

Yet now, Amy Miller lived without any child. Investigators pressed repeatedly, but she denied ever taking in an orphan.

Stranger still, Luna White was indeed the biological daughter of that White couple.

Sean massaged his temples. The threads tangled like knotted yarn—connections visible yet impossible to unravel.

Luna and Julia Shaw could be twins. Yet every lead pointed to Amy Miller's adopted child being Julia's bloodline.

Where had that child gone? Those who knew either kept silent or had taken their secrets to the grave.

The truth seemed forever buried beneath Six Paths Village's yellow earth.
###Chapter 335 Midnight Terror

2:15 AM. The shrill ringtone shattered the silence.

Sean Shaw rubbed his throbbing temples, tearing his gaze away from the mountain of paperwork. A glance at his wristwatch made his brows knot instantly.

"Who is it?"

"Boss! It's about Kevin!" The bodyguard's panicked voice crackled through the phone. "He's in critical condition at Harmony Hospital. The doctors said... he might not make it—"

Sean shot to his feet, his suit jacket tumbling to the floor. "Spare no expense! I'm on my way."

He stormed into the master bedroom in three strides. Julia Shaw slept peacefully, her well-maintained complexion glowing like pearls under the nightlight. Even now, the grace of her former days as a prima ballerina lingered in her posture.

"Julia! Wake up!"

She jolted awake, fury igniting in her eyes.

"Kevin's in the hospital." Sean's voice was ice.

The silk sheets flew back. Julia's bare feet hit the carpet, her nails nearly tearing through the delicate nightgown. "He said he was just going out for drinks!"

After the incident in the city last month, Kevin had been grounded for weeks. Tonight was his first night out, and she'd explicitly ordered the bodyguards to keep a close watch.

"Details are still unclear." Sean already had the car keys in hand.

The black Mercedes sped through the night. Julia clenched the seatbelt, her knuckles white. "It must be those troublemaking friends of his again..."

The ER's red light burned their eyes. Two bodyguards cowered on the bench like beaten dogs, scrambling to their feet at their approach.

"Boss! The doctors are still working on him—"

Julia's slap cut through the air. "Useless!" Her pearl necklace swayed violently with her heaving chest. "If anything happens to my son—"

"Ma'am!" The older bodyguard interrupted reluctantly. "This time, it really wasn't our fault..."

Sean suddenly gripped his wife's shoulder. His sharp eyes caught the suspicious dark stains on the younger guard's pant leg—and the few drops of fresh blood glistening ominously on the ER floor.


###Chapter 336: Cardiac Arrest

"Who did this?" Wu Jingxian shrieked, her nails digging deep into her palms. Her precious son was fighting for his life in the emergency room, while these useless bodyguards were still making excuses. She'd already decided—once this was over, she'd fire these good-for-nothing idiots.

Sean Shaw gripped his wife's shoulder. "Calm down. Let them finish."

The two bodyguards exchanged nervous glances before speaking.

"Mr. Shaw didn't get into any fights tonight. He was just drinking with friends at the club. We were right by the booth the whole time. But then suddenly, he—"

"Then what?" Wu Jingxian snapped.

"He stood up, ripped open his shirt, and charged into the dance floor bare-chested. Started pounding his chest like a madman while dancing." The guard swallowed hard. "The crowd panicked when someone screamed. By the time we pushed through, Mr. Shaw was on the ground... bleeding from all seven orifices..."

"The doctor said poison?" Sean's brow furrowed.

"Or cardiac arrest," the guard added. "We called the ambulance immediately."

Sean fell silent. Hemorrhaging from seven orifices did suggest poisoning, but who would target his son? Only a handful of people had recent grudges against Kevin...

Shawn Johnson? Impossible. They'd already handed over the coal mines and land. No motive for delayed revenge.

Luna White and Andrew Smith? Even less likely. Traveling all this way to poison someone over minor grievances made no sense.

Just then, the operating room lights flicked off.

"Doctor! How's my son?" Wu Jingxian lunged forward, clutching the physician's white coat.

The doctor removed his mask with grim finality. "Tox screens ruled out poisoning. Exploratory surgery confirmed acute myocardial infarction... We did everything we could."

"Impossible!" Wu Jingxian's scream shattered the hallway. "He's in his twenties! Money isn't an issue—just save him!"

The doctor shook his head. "This isn't about money. With acute cardiac arrest... even transferring him now would be too late. You should... say your goodbyes."

Wu Jingxian's legs gave out as she collapsed to the floor. Sean's face turned ashen, aging a decade in seconds. Their pride and joy, the Shaw family's sole heir—gone just like that...
###Chapter 337: Distancing

Shawn Johnson's phone rang abruptly at six in the morning.

"Mr. Johnson, Kevin Shaw died suddenly at the nightclub last night," the voice on the other end sounded panicked.

He bolted upright in bed, nearly dropping his phone. The dim gray light of dawn filtered through the curtains, casting mottled shadows across his face.

"Heart attack?" His voice was tight.

After hanging up, Shawn lit a cigarette. As the smoke curled around him, he remembered Luna White's eerily calm eyes.

A month ago, when Luna had approached him, she'd only said one thing: "I want Kevin Shaw dead." He'd assumed she would hire a hitman or set up some elaborate trap. Never had he expected...

"Clever," he muttered, stubbing out the cigarette with a cold laugh.

Kevin Shaw had deserved to die. That bastard had ruined countless girls in his hometown, yet always walked free. But the way Luna had orchestrated his death without leaving a trace sent a chill down Shawn's spine.

"Young Master, your grandfather requests your presence for breakfast," the butler reminded softly outside the door.

In the dining room, Old Mr. Johnson was reading the newspaper. He smiled warmly when his grandson entered. "Come, the millet porridge is freshly made."

"Grandfather," Shawn sat down, his voice low. "There's been an incident with the Shaws. Kevin died suddenly at the nightclub last night."

The spoon in the old man's hand clattered into the bowl. "What? That boy was barely thirty!"

"They're calling it a heart attack." Shawn stirred his porridge absently, appetite gone. "Grandfather, about Dr. White... I think we should keep our distance."

The old man frowned. "What do you mean? She saved my life."

"Exactly because she's too capable." Shawn set down his chopsticks. "Kevin's death is suspicious. I suspect—"

Before he could finish, the old man broke into a violent coughing fit. Shawn stood immediately, but his grandfather waved him off. "I'm fine. Are you suggesting Dr. White was involved?"

After a long pause, Shawn nodded.

The old man sighed deeply. "Very well. We'll remember her kindness, but from now on... minimize contact."

Outside, the morning sun finally broke through the clouds. Shawn stared at the blinding light, suddenly recalling Luna's parting words:

"Mr. Johnson, we're even now."

At the time, he'd thought she meant saving his grandfather. Now, he wondered if she'd been referring to something else entirely.

The realization made his blood run cold.
###Chapter 338: Clash of Generations

"Something wrong? You have issues with Dr. White?"

Old Master Johnson sipped his red bean and barley porridge leisurely, savoring the creamy texture melting on his tongue. Thick, hearty porridge had always been his favorite.

"Dr. White is too calculating." Shawn Johnson set down his fork, brows furrowed. "A girl barely in her twenties, yet she maneuvers like a seasoned player. I fear we're nurturing a viper in our bosom."

The old man burst into laughter, crow's feet crinkling at his eyes. "Shawn, few earn such praise from you. Go on—how has she offended you?"

Shawn hesitated. His suspicions about Luna remained just that—suspicions.

"Grandfather, you don't know her. Saving you might've been a ploy to exploit our family's influence."

The porcelain bowl clinked sharply as the patriarch set it down, his expression hardening.

"Shawn, do you take me for a senile fool?" He retrieved a dossier from his drawer. "Read this."

Shawn's pupils contracted as he flipped through the pages.

"This is—"

"Records of every patient Luna treated these past six months." The old man's voice was steady. "Not a single penny in fees. She nearly lost her job saving an unrelated child."

Shawn's fingers absently traced the document edges.

"But the Shaws—"

"Did you witness Kevin Shaw's death yourself?" The patriarch's gaze turned piercing. "The hospital's death certificate states clearly—myocardial infarction."

A branch snapped outside, startling sparrows into flight.

"Still, Grandfather—"

"Shawn," the elder interrupted, "know why I value Luna?"

Shawn shook his head.

"She possesses what our family lacks most." The old man gazed through the window. "The courage to sacrifice everything for conviction."

Silence engulfed the study, broken only by the grandfather clock's ticking.

"Her methods, though—"

"Methods?" The patriarch scoffed. "When I led a company to obliterate enemy command posts, did you question methods?"

Shawn's head jerked up.

"Grandfather, you're—"

"Remember," the old man rose, his shadow looming large against the wall, "great deeds tolerate no fastidiousness."

He pulled a yellowed album from the shelves.

"Look."

The photo showed a younger version of himself standing amidst corpses, eyes sharp as blades.

"Back then, no one lectured me about methods."

Shawn's Adam's apple bobbed.

"I understand."

The patriarch patted his grandson's shoulder, voice softening abruptly. "Shawn, sometimes people aren't what they seem."

He tapped his chest.

"See with this."
###Chapter 339: Clash of Generations (Part Two)

"Second point." The old man set down his chopsticks, his gaze sharp as a blade. "What kind of monster Kevin Shaw is—don’t you already know?"

Shawn Johnson’s fingers tightened imperceptibly.

"The underage assault cases you uncovered are just the tip of the iceberg." The grandfather pulled a thick file from his desk drawer and slammed it onto the table. "At fifteen, he violated a ten-year-old girl."

Shawn’s pupils constricted.

"The Shaws paid to silence it." The old man’s laugh was icy. "Child protection laws became that beast’s shield."

Outside, thunder cracked, and rain poured in sheets.

"How many children has he ruined over the years?" The grandfather’s voice trembled. "The oldest was barely twelve. If it had been your sister—"

"Grandfather!" Shawn shot to his feet, his chair screeching against the floor.

The old man stared at his whitened knuckles. "Now you feel rage?"

Shawn’s chest heaved. The photos from the files flashed in his mind—hollow-eyed little girls, wrists mottled with bruises.

"Your so-called justice," the grandfather stirred his congee slowly, "is nothing but indulgence for devils."

A bead of cold sweat slid down Shawn’s temple.

"Luna White handled it beautifully." The old man suddenly smiled. "A bloodless kill—that’s true skill."

Shawn’s head snapped up.

"Compared to your lofty principles on paper," the grandfather rose, his cane striking the floor, "I prefer that girl’s decisiveness."

Heavy footsteps echoed on the stairs.

Shawn stood alone in the dining room. Rain hammered against the windows like the wails of restless ghosts.

Mechanically, he flipped open the latest intelligence report. Kevin Shaw’s drinking party notes glared back at him:
«Find some experts in breaking women»
«Head out of town»
«Make that bitch’s life hell»

Location: Cloud City.
Target: Luna White.

Shawn’s fist crashed onto the table. Dishes rattled violently.

He had been the accomplice all along.

If Kevin Shaw hadn’t died… He didn’t dare imagine what would’ve happened to Luna. Three of the marked thugs in those files were HIV-positive.

"Hah…" A low, self-mocking laugh escaped him.

The law? Due process? Against living demons, they were nothing but elegant jokes.

He lifted the now-cold bowl of red bean congee and drained it in one gulp. The cloying sweetness spread across his tongue but couldn’t mask the metallic tang rising in his throat.

Outside, lightning split the night sky.

Illuminating the murderous intent in his eyes.
###Chapter 340: Undercurrents

The phone rang abruptly, its shrill tone cutting through the silence. Luna White stared at the flashing name on the screen—Shawn Johnson—her fingers trembling slightly. She took a deep breath and pressed the answer button.

"Kevin Shaw is dead."

Those four words froze Luna where she stood. Slowly, she lowered the phone and gazed at her palms. These hands, once meant only for healing, were now stained with blood.

"I don't regret it," she whispered.

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a pale glow on her face. Kevin Shaw deserved to die—the thought coiled in her mind like a serpent. Memories of humiliation from her past life surged forward: the man's greedy eyes, his filthy touch...

Luna clenched her fists, nails digging into her flesh. Medical school would begin in three months. She should have been preparing for a new life, full of hope. Instead, she felt hollow.

Her phone vibrated again. A text from Andrew Smith: "Meet me at our usual spot at 8 tonight."

Reading it, the tension in her shoulders eased slightly. Andrew had been her anchor these past months, a safe harbor in the storm.

But how long would this peace last?

Luna frowned. Clara Clark and her daughter had been unusually quiet lately. Knowing Clara, this wasn't surrender—it was the calm before a greater storm.

Ding-dong.

The doorbell interrupted her thoughts. Peering through the peephole, she saw a familiar face—Andrew's older brother, Adrian Smith, standing outside with two bottles of wine.

"Luna, open up!" His cheerful voice carried through the door. "I brought these back from France. Tonight, we drink until we drop!"

She sighed in amusement. Ever since their last meeting, Adrian had taken to dropping by unannounced, claiming he was "vetting his little brother's choice."

The moment the door opened, Adrian barged in. "Listen, Andrew's been acting shady lately. He's definitely planning some kind of surprise—" He stopped mid-sentence, studying her face. "What's wrong? You look terrible."

Luna shook her head. "Just tired."

Adrian narrowed his eyes and lowered his voice. "Did Clara cause trouble again?"

Her pulse jumped. It seemed both Smith brothers were wary of their stepmother.

"No, she's been... quiet."

"Quiet?" Adrian scoffed. "A hibernating viper is the most dangerous kind." He patted her shoulder. "Don't worry. With Andrew and me around, she won't get far."

Luna forced a smile, but unease prickled at her. The stillness before a storm was always the most suffocating.

Outside, dark clouds gathered on the horizon.
###Chapter 341: Transfer Orders

"Dr. Miller, you wanted to see me?"

Luna White set down her medical chart and strode into the dean's office. June sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting dappled patterns across her white coat.

Dean Miller sat behind his desk, fingers drumming restlessly on the surface. When Luna entered, he jerked to his feet before sinking back into his chair.

"Have a seat." His voice was strained.

Luna's sharp eyes noted how the dean avoided meeting her gaze. His empty teacup kept lifting and settling without purpose.

"What's wrong?" She cut to the chase.

The dean drew a deep breath and pulled a document from his drawer. The paper trembled slightly in his hand.

"Dr. White... I'm so sorry."

As Luna took the file, a chill crawled up her spine the moment her fingers touched the paper. Two bold characters glared back at her: Transfer Orders.

"Border medical team?" She read the contents softly.

Dean Miller surged to his feet, pacing like a caged animal. "This is absurd! An acupuncturist with zero battlefield trauma training being sent to—"

"When do I leave?" Luna's voice remained calm.

"Next week." He halted, throat working. "Luna, you can appeal this. With your qualifications—"

"No need." She folded the document neatly and returned it to the desk. "I'll comply."

An ambulance siren wailed outside, sharp and jarring. The dean slammed his fist on the desk, sending the teacup rattling.

"Do you know how many medics died there last year? Nineteen! You're only nineteen yourself!"

Luna stood, the hem of her coat swaying gently. Sunlight traced the delicate curve of her profile.

"Dean, my father was nineteen when he died."

Silence swallowed the office. The dean's mouth opened, then closed as he collapsed into his chair.

"It's Wei Shufen, isn't it?" he whispered.

Luna offered no reply. Adjusting her collar, she turned toward the door. Her hand paused on the knob.

"Thank you for everything these past two years."

The quiet click of the closing door struck the dean like a hammer blow. He grabbed the phone, then let it drop. The transfer orders glared under the sunlight, the crimson official seal burning bright in the bottom corner.
###Chapter 342: Undercurrents

Luna White stood by the window, her fingers lightly tapping against the sill.

The truth was crystal clear in her mind.

The number of people who would go to such lengths to target her could be counted on one hand. And those who hated her enough to want her dead? Even fewer.

The answer was obvious.

Wei Shufen.

Just as expected.

The other shoe was finally about to drop.

This move was ruthless.

Transferring her thousands of miles away.

First, distance would erode emotions. No matter how deep Andrew Smith's love was, time and separation would wear it down. And when the moment was right, Ding Min would swoop in—effortless and inevitable.

Second, that place was a death trap. One wrong step, and her life would be over.

Two birds with one stone.

A bloodless execution.

Compared to Wei's petty schemes before, this was the work of a true master.

"Luna, I know this isn't fair to you," Dean Miller sighed. "But as doctors, saving lives is our duty. I believe someone of your caliber will shine wherever you go."

Luna smiled faintly. "Don't worry, Dean. I've always followed my conscience. No matter where I am, I'll do what needs to be done."

Dean Miller's eyes grew moist. "Good girl... Promise me you'll stay safe."

"Yes, ma'am."

Watching Luna's straight-backed figure walk away, the dean felt a lump in her throat.

The girl was too composed.

Not a single complaint.

As if she were heading to some paradise.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Old Li..."

"No way around it? She agreed without hesitation, didn't even flinch. That just makes me feel... worse."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"It's a direct order from above. The old boss hinted... there's no room for negotiation."

Dean Miller tightened her grip on the receiver. "All I ask is that she comes back alive."

Li Dongliang let out a long sigh on the other end.

If only they'd known...

They never should have recruited her from the aeronautics academy in the first place.

Now, it was too late for regrets.
###Chapter 343: Career Blueprint

Luna White had just stepped into the department when Dean Sandra Miller's call came through.

"Dr. White, your transfer order has been approved. You have ten days to hand over your duties," Dean Miller's voice crackled through the receiver.

Hanging up, Luna tightened her grip on the transfer notice. Ten days. Only ten days left.

Back in her dorm, she glanced around. This tiny room, barely twenty square meters, held so many memories. Medical journals lay open on the desk in the corner, and a framed photo of her and her sister sat on the nightstand.

Lily Clark and William Cooper had long since moved out.

Lily rented a storefront with a courtyard in the southern district—a tailor shop in front, two small rooms in the back. William took one of them, and the two helped each other out.

Lily's business was surprisingly successful.

She took orders by day and attended cutting classes at night. A few small suggestions from Luna—like adding waist darts to ordinary blouses—made her designs stand out. Within three months, Lily had added two sewing machines and hired two assistants. Now she only handled design and quality control, making her workload much lighter.

William's clothing store was on the same street as Luna's sister's shop.

His first batch of bell-bottoms sold out instantly. These days, he made frequent trips south for inventory, coming back noticeably thinner.

The best part? They had teamed up.

William handled sourcing, while Lily handled pattern-making and production. With her skilled hands, she could replicate sample garments flawlessly after just one glance—near-zero margin of error.

Their business kept growing.

Lily added five more sewing machines, expanding her team to eight workers. Now, eighty percent of William's stock came from her workshop. Lower costs, higher profits.

"Dr. White, we're opening a second store," William had excitedly told her yesterday.

They were even planning to become provincial distributors, so other retailers wouldn’t have to travel south—they could just source from them.

Luna stood by the window, watching the sunset paint her dorm in gold.

These two young people, who had once had nothing, now had thriving careers of their own.

And she—she was about to embark on a new journey.
###Chapter 344: The Deed Controversy

Luna White carefully tucked the yellowed property deed into her bag. As her fingertips brushed the paper, she could still detect the faint scent of ink lingering on its surface. It's time to go, she thought, time to bid farewell to her sister and brother-in-law.

She planned to purchase her train ticket today.

Better to leave sooner rather than stay and make her sister and brother-in-law sad. As for Andrew Smith... She bit her lower lip, deciding to call him later that evening. If she called now, he'd undoubtedly be sweating it out on the training field.

If he found out this was all Clara White's doing...

Luna smirked coldly. If Clara dared to pull this stunt, she'd have to face the consequences. Luna wasn't some saint who'd spare a thought for that wicked stepmother.

The hot pot restaurant hadn't opened for business yet.

Pushing the door open, she saw her sister and brother-in-law huddled together at the counter, going over the accounts. Ryan Wallace's arm rested lightly over Luna Whitaker's shoulder, their closeness so intimate their breaths seemed to mingle.

Luna Whitaker's cheeks were flushed, and though faint lines still lingered at the corners of her eyes, she radiated happiness—a far cry from the haggard woman she'd once been.

"Big sis! Ryan!"

At Luna's voice, the two quickly pulled apart. Luna Whitaker, her face still pink, tugged her sister closer. "Luna, what brings you here at this hour? Don't you have work at the hospital?"

Ryan scratched his head with an embarrassed grin before slipping away to the kitchen.

"Ryan's really wrapped around your finger now," Luna teased.

Luna Whitaker raised a hand as if to swat her, but the gesture was gentle. "Enough joking. What's going on?"

Luna pulled the deed from her bag and handed it over.

Luna Whitaker unfolded it, her eyes widening instantly. "This... this is the deed to our restaurant? Wait—the entire street? Where did you get this?"

Her hands trembled. That single sheet of paper represented ownership of the entire block.
###Chapter 345: Justice Served, A Toast to Victory

"Luna, guess where this came from?" Luna White waved a piece of paper, her eyes glinting mischievously.

Maya White took it and nearly jumped in shock. "This... this is the Shaw family's land deed!"

"Exactly." Luna smirked. "That bastard Kevin Shaw nearly killed us. Shawn Johnson helped us get this as compensation."

Maya's fingers trembled. The memory flashed before her—the speeding car crashing into the wall, Kevin's twisted face, and the dark barrel of his gun.

"We... we can't take this." Maya hastily shoved the deed back into her sister's hands. "If that lunatic finds out—"

"Don't worry, Maya." Luna's lips curled into a cold smile. "Kevin Shaw is dead."

"Dead?" Maya's head snapped up, her voice cracking.

"Mm. Dead." Luna shrugged casually. "Heard it was a gruesome end."

Maya suddenly covered her mouth, tears spilling over. Not from grief, but from overwhelming relief. That monster could never hurt her family again.

"Am I... am I horrible for feeling this way?" Maya choked out, even as her lips twitched upward.

"Maya, we should celebrate." Luna squeezed her sister's shaking hands. "That bastard almost destroyed our family. Now he's gone. We can finally sleep at night."

Maya thought of Ryan Wallace checking the doors and windows every night, the butcher knife always in his bag. She remembered the fear in her chest every time she walked the kids to school, how Luna had nearly died—

"Yes, we should celebrate!" Maya burst into laughter, the sound almost hysterical. "That bastard got what he deserved!"

The sisters locked eyes, their laughter growing louder, startling Ethan and Aaron Jackson playing in the yard.

"Aunt Luna, Mom, what's so funny?" Aaron asked curiously.

Luna scooped up her nephew and planted a kiss on his cheek. "Auntie's happy! Tell your dad to break out his good wine tonight—we're having a feast!"

"Yes, a celebration!" Maya wiped her tears, her voice light as a bird's. "Tonight, we celebrate properly!"

As the sun set, the aroma of food filled the yard. Ryan was baffled by his wife's uncharacteristic excitement—until he heard the news. The usually stoic man's eyes reddened.

"Good riddance..." he muttered, pulling out his gleaming butcher knife and slamming it into the cutting board.

That night, the White family's home glowed with light and laughter. No one mourned Kevin Shaw's death.

Justice had been served.
###Chapter 346: Concealment

"Luna, what did you just say? You're leaving? Where are you going?" Maya White grabbed her sister's wrist, her fingers trembling slightly.

Ethan and Aaron Jackson immediately perked up, their dishrags frozen mid-wipe.

"Big sis, sit down first." Luna pulled Maya onto the wooden bench. "I've received a transfer order. They're sending me to provide medical support in another region. I have to leave in two days."

She deliberately swallowed the words "epidemic zone." If Maya knew she was heading to a frontline hospital, she'd faint from crying.

"Why would they transfer you now?" Maya's voice cracked. "There are so many doctors at your hospital. Why does it have to be you?"

Her knuckles whitened as she gripped her apron. Though they couldn't meet daily, at least she knew her sister was safe in the city. Now, she wouldn't even know where Luna was.

"Big sis!" Luna leaned closer, whispering in her ear. "This is a chance to distinguish myself. I might even get promoted to Deputy Chief Physician when I return." She blinked, feigning nonchalance.

Maya smacked her arm in frustration. "Who cares about promotions? I just want you safe and settled, married to Andrew with children..." Her voice trailed off, eyes reddening.

"I'm not getting married!" Luna suddenly buried her face in Maya's shoulder, pretending to sulk. "I'm sticking with you forever!"

"Who says you're not?"

A deep male voice came from the doorway. Luna straightened instantly, while Maya gaped in surprise at Ethan White.

"Did you two plan this?" Maya wiped her eyes, her voice still thick. "Perfect timing. I'll have Ryan prepare the filling—we're making dumplings!"

She hurried toward the kitchen, calling over her shoulder, "Ryan! Ethan's here. Chop the filling!"

Ryan's acknowledgment was followed by the sound of the fridge opening and closing.

"You two wait here," Maya peeked out. "I'll call you when the dough's ready."

The moment Maya disappeared, Luna hissed, "Ethan, how did you—"

"Did you think I wouldn't come?" Ethan's face was stormy. "You're reckless!"

Luna pressed a finger to her lips. "Don't let Maya know the details."

"Obviously!" Ethan slammed a fist on the table but caught himself before the noise drew attention.

Seeing her brother's bloodshot eyes, Luna forced a smile. "Relax. Your little sister's tough."

Ethan suddenly gripped her shoulders. "Listen. I've applied for a transfer to the same warzone."

"What?" Luna shot to her feet. "Are you insane?"

"I'm your brother." His gaze was ironclad. "If anyone dies, it'll be me first."

The rolling pin's rhythmic thuds echoed from the kitchen. Luna stamped her foot. "Withdraw your application now!"

But Ethan was already walking away. "Maya, I'll help roll the wrappers."

Watching his retreating figure, Luna dug her nails into her palms. She knew Ethan too well—there was no talking him out of this.
###Chapter 347: Parting Words

The dinner table was filled with warmth and laughter.

Luna White remained blissfully unaware, thinking her sister's transfer was just a routine hospital reassignment. Apart from reminding Luna to take care of herself, she didn’t have many worries. However, she did notice her brother Ethan’s subdued mood and assumed it was due to exhausting training.

Before they left, Luna discreetly slipped five thousand yuan into her sister’s bag. The previous loan of ten thousand had long been repaid—this was just in case conditions were harsh where Luna was headed. At the very least, she shouldn’t have to skimp on food.

These days, Luna was far from strapped for cash.

Little did she know that where Luna was going, money couldn’t buy much of anything worthwhile.

"Big sis, I’ve already booked my ticket, so I won’t come to say goodbye—and don’t see me off either. Keep this deed safe. When you have the means, build a large commercial center here, just like I told you. The rental income alone will keep you counting money till your hands ache. Stop being so frugal—Ethan and the others are grown now. Don’t keep saying, 'We’ll buy a house when we have enough money.'"

Luna kept rambling, afraid her sister wouldn’t take her advice. She knew her too well—Luna had been thrifty for so long that even with money, she’d hesitate to spend it. But what was the point of saving if it didn’t improve their lives?

When you had nothing, frugality was necessary. But clinging to it even when you had means? That was just self-sabotage.

And her sister was absolutely the type to do exactly that.

What was the point of living if all you did was earn money without ever enjoying it? You might as well be a machine.

Luna walked her siblings to the door, enduring her sister’s well-meaning nagging.

Honestly, where did this kid get her penchant for worrying?

Ethan escorted Luna back, and the two parted ways with a wave at the intersection.

At the dormitory entrance, Ethan stopped. "I’ll leave you here—I only got half a day off. I won’t lecture you, but promise me you’ll take care of yourself out there. Bullets don’t have eyes—don’t get reckless just because you think you’re capable." His concern was genuine.

If Luna didn’t know the situation, he certainly did.

The conflict was escalating, with skirmishes breaking out constantly. Some areas had even seen consecutive clashes.

The thought of Luna—a young woman—going into such a place made his stomach twist.

"Relax, big brother. I’ll be fine. Besides, I’m a doctor—I might not even get near the frontlines. There are plenty of hospitals there. Who knows? I might just stay in the rear." Luna tried to reassure him, though she knew better—Wei Shufen would never let her stay safely in a rear hospital.

The frontlines were waiting for her.

But as a doctor, saving lives was her duty. No matter what, she had chosen this path and was prepared for it.

In her memory, these border conflicts wouldn’t last much longer. It was already the summer of 1986—by 1989, things would settle down.

Who knew? By the time she arrived, the fighting might already be winding down.

Others might not realize it, but she had a clear understanding.

The wheels of history wouldn’t turn differently just because she was there.
###Chapter 348: Andrew's Mission

Luna White was packing her suitcase.

The humid southern climate forced her to reorganize her belongings. She carefully folded her heavy winter clothes into cardboard boxes, leaving only a few lightweight summer outfits. Her acupuncture kit and essential medicines were placed prominently, followed by two packets of brown sugar and a box of chocolates.

"These will probably melt into a sticky mess," she muttered, yet stubbornly shoved them into her backpack.

When her fingers brushed against the thick stack of cash tucked inside, she couldn't help but smile. Her eldest sister always made sure she'd never face hardship away from home.

Just as she zipped up the backpack, the phone rang.

"Dr. White, no need to purchase your own ticket," came Director Sandra Miller's voice through the receiver. "We're departing with other medical personnel. Someone will meet us upon arrival."

Hanging up, Luna exhaled in relief. She was about to call Andrew when the phone rang again.

"Andrew?" She grabbed the receiver eagerly.

Amidst chaotic assembly whistles in the background, Andrew's voice sounded unusually rushed: "Luna, I've been deployed."

Her heart plummeted. "What mission? Why so sudden?"

"I might be unreachable for months." He paused, his tone turning gravely serious. "Luna, if... if I don't make it back—"

"Don't you dare!" Her voice cracked with panic.

"Just in case," he said with unprecedented heaviness. "Take care of yourself. Find someone good—"

"Andrew Smith!" she nearly shouted.

"Fall in!" came a distant command before Andrew hurriedly said, "Luna, I love you. Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me."

"Wait! Listen to me—"

The line went dead, leaving only hollow dial tones.

Luna's hand trembled around the receiver. What kind of perilous mission would make Andrew speak like this?

A sudden realization drained the color from her face. Could they possibly be heading to the same place?

"That fool..." She bit her lip, whispering, "We really are made for each other."

(End)
###Chapter 349: To the Frontlines

"Fall in!"

Andrew Smith's whistle pierced the morning silence. The soldiers stood ready, their packs neatly arranged at their feet. In the small railway station square, he quickly counted heads.

"Board the train!"

He cast one last glance at the familiar city skyline. Between the towering buildings, he could almost see the figures of his family and beloved waving goodbye. Unbeknownst to him, the very next day after his departure, Luna White would embark on the same journey.

When Luna arrived in the province, night had already fallen. She hurriedly followed her unit to transfer to another train. Under the searchlights, the steel behemoth lay quietly on the tracks, waiting to carry them to the front.

"Move! Faster!"

The commander's shouts echoed across the platform. Luna watched as military trucks slowly rolled onto wide steel plates, secured firmly with thick cables. Artillery and supplies were carefully loaded.

"Medical team, this way!"

Luna followed her teammates into the sweltering train car. Under the harsh lights, she heard the splash of water—workers were spraying the roof with hoses to cool it down.

"It's unbearable..."

Her white coat was already soaked with sweat. Though she had mentally prepared herself, the southern humidity was more oppressive than she'd expected.

Two large metal buckets filled with ice stood by the door, white mist curling from them, but doing little to relieve the stifling heat. Straw mats covered the floor, where soldiers lay shoulder to shoulder.

"Dr. White, the medical team is in the last car."

She nodded and made her way through the crowded compartments, medical kit in hand. The medical car was just as hot, but the left door was slightly ajar, chained open for ventilation. Thirty female medics huddled together, encouraging one another.

The train began to move.

After what felt like an eternity, it finally stopped at a small station.

"End of the line!"

They were assigned temporary barracks. Rumor had it the advance units had already departed, leaving many rooms vacant. Luna had barely lain down when the assembly whistle startled her awake.

"Motorized advance! Prepare to move out!"

Before dawn, the convoy was ready. Luna and her fellow medics squeezed into a truck, enduring two days of rough travel before reaching the border town.

"Beyond here is the danger zone."

A nurse beside her whispered. Luna looked out the window—black telephone wires sprawled like spiderwebs across the hills, thick as barrels. In the distance, the scent of gunpowder grew stronger.


###Chapter 350: Night March

Luna White dug her nails into her palm. The sharp pain snapped her back to focus. You're a medic, she reminded herself. Following orders is your duty.

The air inside the transport vehicle was thick with tension. Rapid breaths of her teammates filled the silence. Some rubbed their hands incessantly; others gripped the seat edges until their knuckles turned white. Fear was etched on every face.

"Look there!" someone hissed.

Outside the window, a massive warning sign stood stark against the sunset. Crimson letters screamed: ARTILLERY ZONE AHEAD—NO ENTRY.

Luna's stomach twisted. Her fingers brushed the cold metal clasp of her medical kit, its familiar weight offering scant comfort.

"They say a medical team last month—" Lily Collins began before being cut off.

"Shut up!" Penny Wang covered her ears. "My daughter's only two..."

The vehicle plunged into silence, broken only by tires crunching over gravel—a grim reminder of the danger ahead.

Luna exhaled slowly. "We're the last line of defense. If we retreat, who'll treat the wounded at the front?"

The convoy jerked to a halt. Bodies lurched forward.

"What's happening?"
"Why are we stopping?"
Panic spread like wildfire.

The doors flew open. A soldier streaked with soot stood silhouetted against twilight. "All out! Night march—now!"

Luna was first on her feet. Though her legs trembled, her voice held steady. "Check your gear. Medical supplies stay with you."

Outside, darkness swallowed everything. The moonless night pressed down like a suffocating blanket.

"Remember discipline!" The squad leader's bark cut through the black. "No talking! No lights! Single file!"

Fingers clutched Luna's sleeve—Lily's. The girl's teeth chattered audibly.

"Stay close," Luna whispered, squeezing the icy hand.

The column moved. Only rustling footsteps and labored breathing marked their progress. Luna counted steps, forcing concentration.

Then—a distant thump. The line froze.

They knew that sound all too well.
Artillery fire.
###Chapter 351: Emergency Redeployment

"Captain, Political Commissar Zhao is on the line!"

The voice of Fu Zi carried through the tent flap. Andrew Smith's fingers paused over the map he was examining. Setting down the red-blue pencil, he strode toward the communications post. Though he carried a walkie-talkie on his belt, he still preferred landline calls.

"Andrew, the situation has changed." Commissar Zhao's voice was uncharacteristically grave. "The redeployment must be completed tonight. All squads will be stationed separately. Remember—move by platoon units and maintain radio contact."

The moment the call ended, Andrew blew the assembly whistle. Within three minutes, every officer at platoon level or above stood at attention in formation.

"Comrades, the situation is more complex than anticipated." Andrew unfolded the map, tracing five red circles with his finger. "We're responsible for these five positions. Point Three is the farthest, and Point Five requires scaling a cliff. I'll lead one team, the deputy captain another, and the three squad leaders will take the rest. We move after nightfall."

The deputy captain added, "Time is critical, so we'll skip the mobilization speech. Remember—as the vanguard unit, we must complete the handover before dawn."

An eerie quiet settled over the camp before nightfall. Soldiers checked their gear. Andrew noticed several recruits' fingers trembling slightly. He understood their tension—training grounds and real battlefields were worlds apart.

"Captain, your leg wraps are loose," radio operator Xiao Li reminded him.

Andrew knelt to retie them. The distant mountain silhouettes dissolved into the encroaching darkness, as unpredictable as the future awaiting them.

"Move out!"

At the command, five squads shot toward different directions like arrows. Andrew's team headed straight for the distant Point Three. They had four hours to reach it—any delay would prevent allied forces from withdrawing on schedule.

The mountain path proved more treacherous than expected. Each man carried forty kilograms of gear, with ration biscuits and canned food clattering in their packs. Andrew recalled his predecessor's warning: though no large-scale conflicts had erupted this year, sporadic skirmishes had already claimed three captains.

"Watch your step!" he cautioned the soldiers behind him in a low voice. In this darkness, the slightest misstep could be fatal.

Clouds obscured the moonlight, forcing them to navigate by compass and map. Andrew touched the pistol at his waist—the cold metal offered a sliver of reassurance.

"Two kilometers left." He checked his luminous watch, lowering his voice further. "Stay alert. Be ready to engage at any moment."

The soldiers nodded silently. The metallic clicks of rifles being chambered cut sharply through the silent woods. None knew what awaited them ahead, but every man understood one truth—from this moment onward, they had become their nation's most unyielding line of defense.
###Chapter 352: Journey Through the Mist

Three hours later, the entire squad reached the high ground. Andrew Smith completed the handover with acting squad leader Bao Yong from the allied forces before leading his team to two other outposts. When the final defensive line was secured, their allies withdrew without incident.

The rugged terrain held immense strategic value. Many unnamed peaks were marked only by dates on military maps. The pre-dawn silence was eerie—even insect chirps sounded unnervingly clear. Despite the smooth transition, tension coiled tighter in every soldier.

Imminent combat. Potential casualties. These would be their first real experiences of war.

Shadows shifted on the opposite ridge, signaling the start of the standoff. Andrew felt no fatigue. Under the blazing sun, his unit remained concealed in bunkers, vigilant. From today onward, observers would maintain 24-hour surveillance through binoculars.

——

Meanwhile, Luna White's all-female medical unit waited at the rear hospital. But frontline skirmishes had already erupted at two outposts after the rotation.

Years of border tensions had dwindled from full-scale clashes to sporadic firefights. Yet the medical commander couldn't sit idle—where bullets flew, wounded followed. The women wouldn't stay sheltered any longer.

Ten emergency teams mobilized instantly. Paired with Lily Collins, Luna shouldered a heavy medic pack for their frontline deployment. Tonight, she'd witness war's brutality firsthand.

The original night operation plan changed when dense fog provided cover. The commander's order was decisive: ten trucks, four guards per vehicle, immediate departure.

Unease thickened inside the armored transport. They were crossing the infamous "Line of No Return"—where real danger lurked not on the border, but along this blood-soaked supply route. Countless soldiers had perished here without ever reaching the front.

Luna clutched her medical kit until her knuckles whitened. The usually composed medic felt her heartbeat drumming against her ribs. Outside, the mist swirled like gauze, veiling untold secrets.
###Chapter 353: Crossing the Fire Line

The medical team's military truck slowly descended the hillside, its tires thudding dully over the wooden bridge. With a sharp turn, it accelerated westward.

Luna White gripped the seat handle tightly. The open landscape outside the window was unnerving—not a single decent tree in sight for hundreds of meters. Her chest tightened. This must be the infamous "Line of Fire."

The four escort soldiers were on high alert, especially the two veteran drivers whose knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. They had been specially chosen to ensure these female soldiers made it through this deadly stretch alive.

The truck suddenly slowed.

"Boom—"

An explosion ripped through the air without warning. Luna's eardrums stung as a wave of heat nearly blew the roof off.

The driver yanked the wheel hard, and the truck roared out of the smoke like a wounded beast.

Chaos erupted inside. The women soldiers screamed, huddling together as their helmets clattered. The shouts of the four escorts were drowned out by the blasts.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

A series of explosions shook them to the core. The windows shattered into dust, filling the cabin with the acrid stench of gunpowder.

The two trucks began swerving wildly. The transport driver's eyes burned with determination as they weaved between craters.

Luna pressed herself as low as possible. The helmet strap dug into her chin, but no one dared loosen it. Now they understood why this was called the "Line of Fire."

"Rat-tat-tat—"

Muffled impacts mixed with the sharp ping of metal being struck. No one could tell if it was bullets or shrapnel—they just scrambled deeper into the corners.

Luna's mind went blank. This was the first time death had felt so close.

The truck jerked sharply onto a dirt path heading west. Ahead lay rolling hills, and the explosions gradually faded behind them.

Then, it stopped.

Luna's fingers still trembled. The ashen faces of her comrades told her she looked no better. Her heart pounded like it might burst from her chest.

Miraculously, only three had been cut by glass. After quick bandaging, the escorts pointed to the fork in the road—it was time to part ways.
###Chapter 354: Night March

The transport truck jolted along the rugged mountain road, its metal frame rattling violently. Luna White and Lily Collins clung to the side rails, their knuckles turning white from the strain. The cabin was thick with silence, broken only by the relentless roar of the engine.

"Half an hour to the supply station," the driver called over his shoulder without turning.

Luna stared at the distant mountain range, her chest heavy as if weighed down by stone. She had assumed the frontlines were in a stalemate—never imagined the reality would be this perilous. Andrew Smith's parting words—"Find a good man and settle down"—now felt like a grim prophecy.

"Lost in thought?" Lily nudged her shoulder.

"Wondering if we'll make it back alive," Luna replied with a bitter smile.

The truck lurched violently, nearly throwing them both off. Lily gripped the handrail, her face pale. "This road's trying to kill us!"

Finally, the vehicle ground to a halt in a hidden mountain hollow. The driver jumped out, swiftly unloading supplies. "Rest while you can. We move out at nightfall."

Inside the tent, Luna mechanically shoveled food into her mouth. The rice tasted like gravel, but she forced herself to swallow. Every ounce of strength would matter in the days ahead.

"Get some sleep," Lily said, drawing the makeshift curtain.

Luna lay on the cot but couldn't quiet her mind. The distant thunder of artillery echoed like a drumbeat against her ribs. She remembered Andrew's warm smile, the hesitation in his eyes before he left.

"Fall in!"

The command shattered the silence. Luna bolted upright to find the transport squad already assembled, each soldier carrying a mountainous load yet standing tall.

"We're splitting your supplies," the captain said tersely. "Stay close. Don't fall behind."

The night swallowed them whole, their path lit only by the faint glow of flashlights. Luna stumbled after the column, her pulse hammering. The real trial was just beginning.

The howling wind seemed to whisper warnings of the dangers ahead. Luna clenched her fists until her nails bit into her palms. In this moment, she was no longer the delicate field medic—she was a soldier.

The squad advanced in silence, soon vanishing into the endless dark. Far away, artillery flashes flickered like the eyes of death watching from the shadows.
###Chapter 355: Between Life and Death

"Faster! We need to move faster!" Luna White's military boots sank deep into the mud, each step like pulling a stubborn root from the earth. Lily Collins trailed behind her, her face as pale as parchment.

A low voice suddenly cut through the darkness ahead: "Halt! Password!"

Both women exhaled in relief. They'd finally arrived.

At the highland outpost, Andrew Smith checked his wristwatch for the tenth time. The supply convoy was two hours late. His men had been surviving on ration biscuits for two days, their lips cracked and bleeding.

"Captain! The medics are here!" The radio operator's voice brimmed with relief.

Andrew stood abruptly, dust cascading from his greatcoat. The ambush three days ago still haunted him—five soldiers fallen, their blood pooling in the trenches like crimson streams.

"Take them to the wounded," he rasped.

Inside the makeshift medical tent, the metallic tang of blood hung thick in the air. Two critically injured soldiers lay on stretchers, their bandages saturated with dark stains.

Lily's knees buckled. A decade as a county hospital nurse hadn't prepared her for wounds this gruesome—shrapnel had torn through abdominal cavities, exposing glimpses of intestine.

"What are you waiting for?" Luna was already crouching beside a patient, fingers steady on his pulse. Her stomach dropped as she assessed the damage. Arterial rupture. Without immediate intervention...

Silver needles gleamed under the kerosene lamp as she unrolled her cloth bundle. The surrounding soldiers exchanged doubtful glances—could this ancient method possibly work?

When the first needle pierced skin, the unconscious soldier convulsed. Beads of sweat formed on Luna's temple as she inserted the second needle precisely into the Hegu point. Miraculously, the gushing blood began to slow.

"It's working!" a transporter gasped. The wounded man's eyelids fluttered open.

Andrew watched from the doorway as the slender figure moved between casualties. Her hands moved with machine-like precision—unthinkable for a woman barely out of her teens.

"Evacuate them immediately." Luna looked up, her gaze locking with his. Her eyes burned with intensity. "The shrapnel's still inside. I've sealed the meridians temporarily, but they won't hold beyond six hours."

The transport team sprang into action. As Andrew approached, he caught an unexpected scent—herbal notes cutting through the bloodstained air.

"You practice traditional medicine?"

Luna wiped her hands clean before answering. "Family acupuncture techniques." She didn't mention the supernatural energy woven into those needles—a life-saving skill honed during her apocalyptic past life.

Lily finally regained her composure, trembling hands dressing minor wounds. She stole glances at Luna, marveling at how the younger woman handled gore with the detachment of someone peeling potatoes.

Night wind carried gunpowder fumes across the trenches. Andrew watched the retreating torchlights of the evacuation team before speaking. "Tomorrow brings a hard fight."

Luna's hands paused mid-motion as she secured her medical kit. She knew—the real trial was just beginning.
###Chapter 356 How Did You Get Here?

Lily Collins snapped to attention when she saw Luna White begin administering acupuncture. Though just a junior nurse, she knew this wasn't the time for idle observation. Several other injured patients still required treatment.

"Let me help!" She immediately knelt to examine the remaining casualties.

Fortunately, most injuries were minor—simple disinfecting and bandaging would suffice. Lily worked efficiently, the sharp scent of antiseptic permeating the air. As she finished dressing the last wound, Luna completed her needle treatment.

The two women exchanged smiles of quiet accomplishment.

The patients murmured grateful thanks while the transport team prepared stretchers. Luna and Lily helped secure the critically wounded. Navigating the treacherous mountain path with two stretchers among twelve people required painstaking care with every step.

"Drink some water." Luna crouched to help a patient sip from her canteen. With dusk approaching, they had four hours to reach camp.

"Fall in! Prepare to move out!" Hank Miller, the transport leader, barked the order.

Just then, Andrew Smith arrived with his deputy. Having just repaired a rock-buried trench, they'd come to see off the evacuation upon hearing about the critical cases.

"Everything ready?" Andrew's voice carried exhaustion.

"Report, Captain! All set!" Hank stood at attention.

Luna's head jerked up at the familiar voice. Moonlight silhouetted the tall figure, sending a tremor through her chest.

Andrew spotted her simultaneously. Their eyes locked—his pupils constricted abruptly, his entire body freezing mid-step.

"Luna?" The whisper held disbelief.

Then, before the stunned assembly, Andrew strode forward and swept Luna into a crushing embrace.

Hank nearly bit his tongue. The other soldiers gaped, some rubbing their eyes in disbelief.

Luna clung to him fiercely. Andrew's warmth dispelled her chill, drawing her deeper into his arms.

"How did you get here?" He suddenly pushed her to arm's length, hands gripping her shoulders, his voice thick with shock and concern.

Moonlight revealed his furrowed brow and stormy eyes. This unforeseen reunion had shattered his composure completely.
###Chapter 357: The Fareleft Unsaid

"Captain! This..." Hank Miller stammered, his eyes wide with disbelief. The medic hadn't even slapped him—something was definitely off.

The hilltop was eerily silent.

Only then did Luna White and Andrew Smith notice every soldier holding their breath, watching them with burning intensity.

"This is my fiancée, Luna White," Andrew declared firmly.

His words shattered the frozen atmosphere.

The soldiers' faces broke into knowing smiles. Amidst the smoke-choked battlefield, such warmth was a rare comfort.

"Captain, we're running out of time," Hank forced out. He'd give anything to buy them more moments, but this was war—not a place for romance.

Andrew's fingers dug into Luna's shoulders. She suppressed a wince and whispered, "We'll meet again."

Suddenly she threw herself against his chest, her supernatural ability humming to life. She'd expend every ounce of power to keep him safe.

Hank rubbed his stinging eyes roughly.

Luna pushed away from Andrew and turned toward the stretcher team.

"Safe journey," Andrew saluted crisply.

Every soldier snapped to attention, returning the salute. The transport unit bore the heaviest sacrifices—they deserved nothing less than full honors.

"Move out!"

Twelve figures vanished into the night.

Andrew stood rooted to the spot. What dangers lurked on that treacherous mountain path? How he longed to escort her personally—but duty forbade it.

Her warmth still lingered in his arms, her unique fragrance clinging to his senses. Yet he'd watched her leave without even a proper goodbye.

"Captain, so Dr. White's your fiancée?" A few grizzled veterans sidled over with grins. They knew their leader tolerated jokes—within regulations.

"Kept that quiet! If she were mine, I'd never let such a beauty near the frontline."

"Fool! The Captain's putting duty first. Did you see Dr. White's skills earlier? That's real talent."

Andrew ignored them, his obsidian gaze fixed on the darkness where she'd disappeared.
###Chapter 358: Life-or-Death Evacuation

At the break of dawn, Luna White and Lily Collins set out carrying a stretcher. The wounded soldier lying on it was deathly pale, his raincoat damp with morning dew. The mountain mist hung thick like an impenetrable curtain around them.

"Watch your step!" Lily whispered, her voice barely audible as if afraid to disturb the silence.

Luna nodded, her fingers gripping the wooden poles so tightly her knuckles turned white. The trail was nearly vertical—one misstep could send them all tumbling down the cliff. The two soldiers at the front bore the stretcher on their shoulders while those at the rear practically crawled. Luna and Lily, positioned in the middle, steadied the wounded while constantly adjusting their balance. Each step felt like dancing on knife's edge.

"Ah!" Luna gasped as a wildgrass blade sliced her cheek. The razor-edged foliage here could draw blood as easily as a knife.

What should have been a four-hour trek took them five. When the camp finally came into view, everyone exhaled in relief. Luna's legs trembled so violently she could barely stand, yet she refused to rest until the handoff was complete.

"You did well," the medic who relieved them patted her shoulder. "Get some rest now."

Nestled between two cliffs, the camp was naturally fortified on three sides. Luna and Lily's tent stood at the innermost section, adjacent to the makeshift infirmary. Both collapsed onto their cots and fell asleep instantly.

Luna dreamed of Andrew Smith standing in sunlight, arms outstretched, his smile brighter than mountain wildflowers. The vision was so vivid it made her lips curve even in slumber.

She woke in the afternoon, rubbing sore arms before hurrying to the infirmary. A line of wounded already waited.

"Bed three needs fresh dressings, bed five requires bandage changes," the doctor said without looking up. "Conserve gauze—our next supply run won't come for twenty days."

Nodding, Luna worked with practiced efficiency, carefully collecting used gauze for sterilization. Sunlight was precious in these mountains—every scrap of fabric had to dry thoroughly to ensure safety.

At nightfall, Luna stood outside her tent gazing at distant peaks. Time here stretched endlessly; a single week felt like a year. She finally understood war's true nature—not just gunfire and explosions, but this daily perseverance, this unyielding guardianship.
###Chapter 359: Emergency Plea for Help

Luna White's silver needles had gained quite a reputation in the camp. Chronic ailments like rheumatism and gastritis found relief under her care. With medical supplies running low, her acupuncture skills shone even brighter.

Since their brief encounter with Andrew Smith, they hadn't crossed paths again. The fierce battles in the highlands kept medics strictly away from the frontlines. Wounded soldiers were carried back through gunfire by brave transporters.

The morning rain had poured relentlessly all night. The damp air clung thick and suffocating, especially unbearable for the northern girls.

"Dr. White! Dr. White!" A frantic voice called outside the tent, thick with local dialect.

Luna lifted the tent flap. A man in a mud-stained yellow coat stood in the rain, his face beneath the bamboo hat etched with desperation. Two soldiers flanked him—clearly his escorts.

"I'm Dr. White. What's wrong?" Luna asked. She was the only White in camp; no chance of mistaken identity.

"Doctor, please save my wife!" The man dropped to his knees in the mud. "The midwife says it's a difficult birth—both mother and child are at risk!"

Luna hurried to pull him up. How many villagers had knelt before her now? Such gestures weighed heavily on her.

Female medics rushed out, helping the man to his feet.

"Take it easy, sir. Just tell us what happened," one soothed.

The man stamped his foot. "There's no time, Doctor! My wife can't wait!"

Luna gripped his shoulder. "Explain the situation clearly so we can prepare."

Between stammers, he managed: "She's been... laboring for two days... The baby's positioned wrong... Now she's bleeding badly..."

Luna turned to Dr. Green immediately. "You're the OB-GYN specialist. This is your call."

Dr. Green frowned. "But we ran out of anesthesia the day before yesterday. The resupply hasn't arrived..."


###Chapter 360: Life-or-Death Decision

"No anesthesia?" The medical team gasped.

The operating room plunged into eerie silence. Everyone understood the implications—a cesarean without pain relief would be pure torture.

Dr. Green's fingers trembled slightly. She'd witnessed too many mothers writhing in agony during childbirth. Now she was expected to make an incision while the patient remained fully conscious?

"Should we proceed?"

The question hung in the air, unanswered. Several young nurses had tears in their eyes. They'd trained to save lives, not inflict suffering.

In the corner, the laboring woman's husband paced frantically. Though he couldn't understand the medical jargon, the tension was palpable.

"Doctor! Please!" The man suddenly dropped to his knees, forehead thudding against the floor. "My wife's dying! The baby too!"

His thick dialect confused most present, but his desperation needed no translation.

Dr. Green closed her eyes. Last month's stillborn delivery flashed through her mind—another woman who'd arrived too late. Would history repeat itself today?

"I can't do it." Her voice cracked. "The pain would kill her before we finished."

Luna White stepped forward. "I can use acupuncture for pain relief."

"Are you insane?" Dr. Green whirled around. "This is major abdominal surgery!"

"I'll keep her stable through the procedure." Luna's gaze never wavered from the barely conscious woman whose swollen belly still rose faintly with each shallow breath.

Two lives at stake.

After a charged silence, Dr. Green snapped into action. "Get the director! Now!"

As a nurse sprinted away, the delivery room filled only with the mother's ragged moans. Luna already held silver needles, her fingertips growing warm. How much of her supernatural ability would this drain?

Then she met the husband's bloodshot eyes. All hesitation vanished.

"Prep for surgery," she murmured, the needles glinting coldly under surgical lights.
###Chapter 361: Between Life and Death

"Quick! Grab the medical kit!" Dr. Wei snatched the emergency bag, and five female medics swiftly followed the local guide. Two armed soldiers trailed behind, scanning the surroundings with vigilance.

The mountain path was rougher than expected. The damp air reeked of decaying vegetation, and the muddy ground was slippery underfoot. Venomous snakes occasionally slithered from the underbrush, only to be deftly flicked away by the guide's wooden stick.

"Almost there!" The guide wiped his sweat and pointed toward a cluster of thatched huts barely visible in the distance. The ramshackle dwellings leaned precariously against one another, their walls bearing faded slogans of patriotism.

The moment they entered the village, a heart-wrenching scream shattered the silence.

"Help! Xia is dying!" The midwife stumbled out, her hands stained crimson.

Luna White's stomach clenched as she rushed into the dimly lit hut behind Dr. Wei. The metallic stench of blood hit her like a wave, making her gag.

On the crude wooden bed, the laboring woman was deathly pale, the straw mat beneath her soaked in blood. The midwife stood frozen, muttering, "Feet first... what do we do..."

"Move!" Dr. Wei shoved the midwife aside and snapped on gloves. Her expression darkened. "Breech birth. Immediate surgery!"

The medics sprang into action—unrolling sterile sheets, prepping instruments. The cramped hut left no room to turn.

"Luna!" Dr. Wei looked up sharply. "Her blood pressure's too low for anesthesia."

All eyes locked onto Luna. She took a deep breath, pulling a half-melted chocolate bar from her pocket. The sticky sweetness coated her tongue as silver needles gleamed between her fingers.

"Hold her down." Luna's voice was eerily calm.

The first needle pierced the laboring woman's scalp. The near-lifeless body convulsed violently. The midwife collapsed, whispering prayers to the heavens.

"Don't stop!" Dr. Wei pinned the thrashing legs. "Continue!"

Beads of sweat dotted Luna's forehead. Second needle. Third. By the seventh, the woman's struggles ceased miraculously.

"BP stabilizing!" a nurse cried.

Dr. Wei grabbed a scalpel. "Prep for delivery!"

Outside, rain hammered the thatched roof in a deafening drumroll. Luna gazed at the storm-blurred mountains, the needles in her hand burning with warmth.

She knew the real trial had just begun.
###Chapter 362: Painless Childbirth

The mother's moans abruptly ceased.

The operating room plunged into eerie silence.

Dr. Green's scalpel hovered mid-air as beads of sweat formed on her forehead. She'd never witnessed this before—a fully conscious patient lying on the table, watching her with clear eyes.

"Doctor... the pain's gone," the woman whispered weakly, disbelief coloring her voice.

Luna White's fingers remained steady on the silver needle, its tip quivering slightly at the acupuncture point on the patient's lower back. She gave Dr. Green a meaningful glance. "Proceed."

"But—" The military surgeon's hands trembled. Despite her extensive battlefield experience, she'd never felt such tension.

"Trust me." Luna's quiet command brooked no argument.

When the scalpel descended, the entire team held their breath.

"Is my baby... alright?" The mother suddenly asked, her lucid gaze belying the ordeal she should've endured.

Dr. Green's head snapped up. The incision had already parted flesh, yet the patient showed no reaction.

"My God..." a nurse breathed.

Luna's needle gleamed coldly under the surgical lights. "Your child's fine," she soothed. "Just a little longer."

The woman actually smiled. "No pain at all. Please save my baby."

Dr. Green exhaled sharply, her movements gaining speed. In that moment, she finally believed in Luna's acupuncture anesthesia.

As the surgery progressed, the mother remained alert—chatting calmly, even comforting nervous staff between the swish of suction tubes removing blood.

"It's out!" The infant's robust cry filled the room.

A healthy boy.

Luna allowed herself a quiet sigh, though her needle hand never wavered. The real challenge remained: the suturing required equal precision.

"Dr. White?" Dr. Green sought confirmation.

"Continue." Luna's voice roughened. "Final stage."

The mother suddenly grasped Luna's lab coat. "Doctor... may I see him?"

That simple request brought tears to every eye in the operating room.
###Chapter 363: Between Life and Death

A piercing infant's cry shattered the silence of the bamboo house.

Dr. Green's scalpel continued its swift movements—the mother's abdominal wound required immediate suturing. Beads of sweat rolled down her forehead, yet she had no time to wipe them away.

"Hand me the baby!" The head nurse deftly severed the umbilical cord and swaddled the newborn in prepared cotton cloth.

The young father's hands trembled as he took the child, tears streaming down his sun-darkened face. He dropped to his knees with a thud, forehead pressing heavily against the bamboo floor.

"Junsheng! We'll name him Junsheng!" The man choked out between sobs, "It's the Liberation Army doctor who gave my boy this life!"

Beside the operating table, Luna White's face had gone deathly pale, her fingertips quivering uncontrollably. She bit down hard on her lower lip, yet the silver acupuncture needle remained steady in the mother's pressure point.

"Hold on for ten more minutes." Dr. Green glanced at Luna's blue-tinged lips, never pausing her suturing.

"No... problem..." Luna forced the words through clenched teeth.

Lily Collins frantically rummaged through the medical kit, only to freeze in shock at its contents—chocolate bars, brown sugar, cocoa powder... Since when were these standard medical supplies?

"Brown sugar water! Now!" Luna's voice had begun to shake.

Clattering sounds erupted from the kitchen as the panicked father stoked the fire to boil water, too distracted to even glance at his child. When the steaming bowl of sugar water reached Luna's lips, droplets still dripped from its chipped rim.

Luna's teeth chattered violently as the scalding liquid slid down her throat. Suddenly, warmth exploded from her chest, miraculously dispelling the bone-deep chill.

Her mind drifted to that rainy night—Andrew Smith's embrace, the steady rhythm of his heartbeat against her ear. That residual warmth seemed to linger within her now, propping up her faltering strength.

"Final stitch!" Dr. Green snipped the suture thread, looking up to find Luna smiling faintly.

The mother beneath the silver needle breathed evenly, while the stubborn young doctor mustered her last ounce of energy to flash a victory sign.
###Chapter 364: Between Fire and Ice

"The surgery is complete!"

Luna White huddled in the corner, shivering violently under the thick military coat. The others suddenly understood—her insistence on bringing the coat upstairs had been foresight.

"Dr. White! What's wrong?" Dr. Collins was the first to notice something amiss.

Trembling, Luna pulled out the silver needles, her fingertips turning pale blue. "Vital... energy... depletion... hypothermia..." Her teeth chattered so badly she could barely speak. "Need... warmth..."

Dr. Collins acted immediately. "Quick! Body heat is most effective!"

Four women rushed forward, forming a tight huddle around Luna like stacked dominos. Lily even stripped off her outer layer, pressing her bare skin against Luna's icy back.

"Rub her hands!"
"Massage her legs! Stimulate circulation!"

In the corner, the midwife gaped in disbelief. In all her years, she'd never witnessed a cesarean where both mother and child survived. But what stunned her more was these city doctors using their own bodies as living heaters.

"Miracles... true miracles..." The midwife muttered as she retreated, spreading the tale through the village by nightfall.

Meanwhile, inside the room, the four doctors endured their own trial—clutching a human ice block in sweltering summer heat, trembling from cold yet refusing to let go.

"Better... much better..." Luna finally stopped shaking, color returning to her pallid face.

Exhausted, the four women collapsed onto the bamboo bed. Across from them, the new mother slept peacefully with her newborn. Their uniforms clung to their backs with sweat—whether from heat or chill, none could tell.
###Chapter 365: Kneeling in Gratitude

"Dr. White! That was absolutely miraculous!" Dr. Wei whispered with a chuckle. "We won't even need fans in the hospital this summer—just having you stand there would cool the whole ward!"

The others stifled their laughter when they suddenly heard the newborn's faint whimpers, quickly covering their mouths.

They had almost forgotten—the room still held the exhausted mother and her fragile baby.

After packing their medical instruments, they tiptoed out. Outside, two young soldiers paced anxiously—delivery rooms were off-limits, and they didn’t dare barge in, wary of offending the villagers.

Hearing the laughter from inside, they exhaled in relief. The tension they'd felt earlier was unbearable.

A cesarean without anesthesia? Unheard of, even among their battle-hardened comrades. Gritty as their wounded soldiers were, none had ever endured surgery without pain relief. Just imagining it made their skin crawl, like stepping barefoot onto a blade.

Yet here they were—mother and child safe, not even a single cry of pain. A miracle!

And the miracle worker? Their very own field medic. If this wasn’t divine skill, what was?

Dr. Wei carefully instructed the new father on postpartum care, deciding to leave the experienced Liu Yun behind for a few days. Once everything was settled, the four of them stepped outside.

"Comrades, let’s head back," Dr. Wei called.

But the soldiers frantically signaled with their eyes.

No warning was needed—the courtyard was packed with a silent, ragged crowd. Gaunt villagers stood shoulder-to-shoulder, their weathered faces etched with hardship.

The medical team instinctively stepped back.

"Friends, please make way. We need to return to camp," Dr. Wei said, forcing calm into her voice.

Luna White tightened her grip on the medical kit. They’d come to save lives—what did these villagers want?

Then came the shock.

Thud. Thud.

Over a hundred people dropped to their knees as one.

"Saviors!" The white-haired elder at the front kowtowed deeply. "Thank you for saving my daughter and grandson!"

Dr. Wei and the others rushed forward, trying to pull them up. "No, please—stand!"

But the villagers refused. Some wept openly. In this barren mountain village, a single life meant hope for an entire family.

Luna’s eyes burned. In this moment, every ounce of exhaustion was worth it.
###Chapter 366: The Healer's Heart

"Miracle doctors! Please save us!" The elderly villagers knelt at the front, their wrinkled faces etched with desperation. Behind them, dozens of ragged villagers crouched, many bearing festering wounds on their limbs.

Dr. Victor Green furrowed his brow, whispering to his team, "What should we do?"

Luna White's heart softened at the sight of their hopeful gazes. "Sir, we must help them. Look at that child—his leg is already infected."

The four medical staff exchanged glances. In these remote mountains, the villagers had no proper clinic, forced to endure illnesses untreated.

"Please rise!" Victor helped the eldest villager to his feet. "We'll request permission immediately to treat everyone."

The crowd dispersed slowly but remained nearby, watching with bated breath.

An hour later, their military liaison returned with approval and two crates of medical supplies.

"Let's begin!" Luna rolled up her sleeves, swiftly arranging her instruments.

For five grueling hours, they worked without rest. Luna's silver needles moved deftly over an elder's swollen joints, her forehead glistening with sweat.

"Try moving now," she said, supporting the man as he stood.

As dusk fell, Victor checked his watch. "Pack up—we must return to camp."

But stepping outside, they froze—

The mountainside blazed with torchlight like a river of stars illuminating the village. The trembling village mayor offered a basket of eggs. "Our humble thanks, saviors..."

Before they could protest, villagers stuffed cured meats and wild berries into their packs. Luna waved frantically. "We can't accept this—it's against regulations!"

The six retreated hastily, pursued by pleading cries: "At least take some eggs, healers!"

Under the moonlight, Luna rubbed her aching arm but smiled. Those genuine smiles outshone any gift.
###Chapter 367: Bonds Between Soldiers and Civilians

The six trudged along the rugged mountain path, their feet slipping on the uneven terrain. Suddenly, a flickering light appeared behind them—the kind-hearted mountain man had caught up, torch in hand.

"Let me see you through!" His sun-weathered face was earnest. "These trails are treacherous in the dark."

With their guide leading the way, their journey became smoother. When they reached the camp, the man waved goodbye, but Luna White quickly stopped him. "Brother, at least have some water before you go!"

"Can't stay—the wife and little one are waiting!" He flashed a toothy grin before vanishing into the night.

Back in the barracks, their stomachs growled with hunger. Remembering the nearly empty rice jar in the villager's home, they hadn't touched a single bite. The new mother needed nourishment, the baby needed milk—how could they take food from those who had so little?

"Come on, let's head to the mess hall!" Luna motioned.

The mess sergeant, hearing of their selflessness, stoked the stove without hesitation. Soon, the aroma of steaming rice filled the air, and he even cracked open two precious cans of meat—a rare indulgence.

"Easy now, don't choke," the sergeant said, watching them devour the meal with a pang of sympathy.

That night, everyone slept more soundly than ever.

The next afternoon, as they worked, the distant clamor of gongs and drums startled them. Luna's heart leapt. "Could it be...?"

A procession appeared on the mountain path, led by the same man from the day before. Villagers carried bamboo baskets overflowing with wild herbs, eggs, and even two clucking hens.

"Comrades of the People's Liberation Army, this is our humble thanks!" the man called out.

The deputy captain fidgeted. "This—this isn't proper protocol..."

"Protocol be damned!" An elderly man with silver hair stepped forward. "You saved our daughter-in-law—you saved our whole village!"

Seeing their refusal would be futile, the deputy captain had an idea. "Wait here, folks!" He turned and ordered soldiers to fetch supplies from the storehouse.

Soon, troops returned with sacks of rice, flour, oil, and other staples, insisting the villagers take them.

"We can't accept this!" The villagers protested.

"That's an order!" The deputy captain feigned sternness. "Soldiers and civilians are family—what's family without sharing?"

In the end, the villagers accepted the gifts with glistening eyes. On their way back, the mountain man wiped his face. "The PLA... truly good people..."

Back at camp, the soldiers gazed at the mountain of gifts, warmth swelling in their chests. These weren't just offerings—they were the people's trust, heavy with gratitude.

"Comrades," the deputy captain stood tall, voice ringing clear. "This is why we serve!"

Every spine straightened in unison. In that moment, their resolve to protect their homeland burned brighter than ever.
###Chapter 368: Suspicious Strangers

After the rainy season, the weather at the border finally cleared. The security perimeter around the camp had loosened slightly, and occasionally, villagers would bring homegrown fruits as gifts, though the soldiers always politely declined.

"Dr. White, are all the bandages dry?" a nurse called from below.

Luna White stood on her tiptoes, hanging the last piece of gauze on the clothesline. The sun beat down on the rocky outcrop, warming her back. Six months here had acclimated her to the relentless heat.

The vantage point offered a clear view of the mountain path. Since her last trip to the highlands to treat the wounded, she hadn't seen Andrew Smith. The letters she sent via supply runners were often delayed by bad weather.

"Hmm?" Luna narrowed her eyes.

Two men in military uniforms were making their way up the trail. The older one, in his thirties, wore an officer's cap with a holstered pistol at his waist. The younger carried a semi-automatic rifle. Both moved briskly but carried no supplies—unusual for anyone heading uphill.

Stranger still, they glanced around furtively, offering only curt nods to passing comrades. The younger man actively avoided eye contact.

Luna's pulse quickened. She took two silent steps back, hiding behind a boulder to observe.

At the checkpoint, the older man flashed his credentials. As the guard leaned in to inspect them, he whispered something. After a moment's hesitation, the guard waved them through.

"Something's wrong..." Luna muttered. She turned to run toward the medical tent—she had to report this immediately.

But after only a few steps, she froze.

The two men weren't heading toward the highlands at all.
###Chapter 369: Truth or Deception

Luna White stood atop the rocky outcrop, squinting at the two figures below.

Dressed in allied uniforms, their behavior was off. Their strides were too deliberate, like bad imitations of military bearing. Worse, their shifty eyes kept darting around.

"Comrades!" Luna's sudden call made them jump.

One instinctively curled his finger around the trigger—a tell that made Luna's pupils contract. Real soldiers didn't startle like that, nor would they make such a threatening gesture toward allies.

"Care for some water?" Her smile didn't reach her icy tone.

The sentries exchanged glances. Since when did the famously aloof Dr. White offer hospitality?

After a silent consultation, the leader-like one declined, "We're on duty."

As they hurried away, Luna raised her voice: "That route's closed! New sentry posts and passwords were set yesterday—didn't your CO brief you?"

Four baffled sentries stared. There were no new posts. No new codes.

Luna moved closer, whispering, "They're imposters."

A young guard protested, "But their—"

"Silence!" Luna snapped. "What did I just say?"

The veteran sentry gasped. "We never changed protocols!"

Rifles snapped up as four pairs of eyes locked onto the retreating figures. The suspects had frozen mid-step, heads bent in urgent discussion.

Luna's lips curled. The foxes had shown their tails.

Real soldiers would've challenged the claim immediately. Only guilty men hesitated over nonexistent orders.

"Stand ready," she murmured. "Disarm them when they turn."

The sentries tensed. This was no small catch.

The duo turned back with strained smiles. "Comrade, we—"

Four soldiers pounced like tigers.

Watching the scuffle, Luna allowed herself a cold smile. The cat-and-mouse game was over.
###Chapter 370: The Trap

The two men exchanged glances before approaching with overly friendly smiles.

"Greetings, comrade!" The man who looked like an official rubbed his hands together, his tone ingratiating. "We're here on urgent orders from higher-ups, but there's a checkpoint ahead, and we don't know the passphrase. Would you mind helping us out? Delaying military affairs would be... unwise." His gaze lingered on Luna White as he spoke.

He studied her deliberately because she was a female soldier—women in the barracks were usually medics. No matter how sharp they seemed, they had their limits. He hoped to find a weakness in her.

If they could slip inside, scout the camp's defenses, and launch a surprise attack, it would be a huge win. Failing that, tossing a couple of grenades at an officer would still fulfill their mission—destruction was their purpose.

"Oh, that's no trouble at all!" Luna beamed with childlike enthusiasm. "You two must be exhausted from your journey. Xiao Liu, fetch some water!" She turned to call out before cheerfully adding, "Perfect timing—we're having braised pork ribs with potatoes today! Smells amazing! Why not join us for a meal before discussing business?"

Her bubbly demeanor made her seem like an innocent young girl.

"Dr. White, don't tempt me!" Xiao Li exaggeratedly swallowed. "I've been craving this for days—I'm eating three bowls today!"

The two men's eyes lit up. Braised pork ribs? How long had it been since they'd had a hot meal, let alone meat? Their supply lines never carried anything this good.

"Well... we wouldn't want to impose," the official-looking man said, rubbing his hands again, grinning widely. "But it has been a while since we had a proper meal."

Luna smiled warmly and gestured. "Come, come, right this way! The barracks have proper resting areas—much better than standing around here." She knew exactly what they were really after.

Their interest wasn't in the food.

As they stood, the two men scanned their surroundings warily. Xiao Li stepped aside with a sincere smile. "After you, comrades!"

The official's hand drifted toward his holster, while the other man subtly touched his waist. Luna caught the movement from the corner of her eye and smirked inwardly. On our turf and still this jumpy? How obvious can you be?

She flicked a glance at her companions. All four understood instantly.

"Right this way!" Luna stepped aside.

The two followed her, already calculating: if things went south, they'd use the female medic as a hostage first.
###Chapter 371: Friendly Fire

Luna White moved past the guards with light footsteps, two men hot on her heels. The cadre-looking man deliberately closed the distance until he was practically breathing down her neck.

"Freeze!" Four soldiers suddenly sprang into action.

Before the duo could react, they were slammed face-first into the dirt. The cadre writhed and roared, "Have you lost your minds? I'll report this to your superiors!"

Luna crouched beside him, her fingers brushing his waist. With a clatter, five grenades rolled onto the ground—their pins looped around his belt buckle, ready to be pulled at any moment.

Cold sweat drenched the soldiers' backs.

So close... just seconds away...

Had Dr. White not set this trap, the entire camp would've been blown sky-high. The thought of potential casualties made the soldiers tighten their grips.

"Ah! Easy!" The men yelped in pain.

Private Lee pressed his rifle barrel against the cadre's temple. "Talk! Who sent you?" His voice trembled. "There's no checkpoint ahead. Where'd you get that passphrase?"

Sixteen grenades and three pistols were confiscated from the duo—a walking arsenal.

"Comrades, this is a misunderstanding!" The cadre kept lying, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Luna chuckled softly. "Since they won't talk..." She picked up a grenade, rolling it playfully in her palm. "Let's toss them in the ravine. Saves paperwork."

Both men turned sheet-white.

Since when did women play by these rules?

"Brilliant!" Private Lee grinned savagely, yanking a rope taut. "We'll use their own grenades. Friendly fire accidents... happen all the time."

As the rope bit into flesh, the cadre finally broke. "We'll talk! It was Black Tiger! He sent us!" His entire body shook.

Luna narrowed her eyes, fingertips tracing the grenade's cold metal casing. Moonlight glinted off the primed fuse.
###Chapter 372: Choices Under Fire

Luna White tucked the stethoscope deeper into her lab coat pocket and waved at the young soldiers. "The rest is up to you. I'm a doctor—duty calls." Humming an old patriotic tune, she strolled out with her hands in her pockets, her ponytail swaying behind her.

"Dr. White sings beautifully!" Private Liu murmured, so entranced he forgot to clean his rifle.

Sergeant Li smacked the back of his head. "Don't get any ideas! That's Captain Smith's fiancée!"

"I just like the melody!" Liu's face flushed red. "Dr. White has saved so many of our brothers—who wouldn't respect her?"

As the four soldiers escorted their prisoners toward headquarters, none noticed the glint of sunlight reflecting from a distant hilltop.

Andrew Smith crouched in the trench, inspecting ammunition when a piercing whistle cut through the air.

"Incoming! Take cover—"

The first shell struck the frontline, showering dirt like rain. Then the second, the third... The entire mountain trembled.

"Casualty report!" Andrew wiped mud from his face.

"One critical in Third Squad—shrapnel to the chest!"

Through the smoke, medics worked frantically on the wounded soldier. Blood soaked through bandages as the man's face turned ghostly pale.

"He needs evacuation now!" Andrew grabbed the radio, static drowning the broken replies.

Down at the medical post, Luna was inventorying supplies when thunderous explosions rattled the windows.

"The frontline!" Her syringe clattered to the floor.

Twenty minutes later, the bombardment ceased, leaving the ridge scarred and smoldering. Shattered trees spewed black smoke; trenches had collapsed into rubble.

"Where are the stretcher teams?" Andrew eyed the darkening sky as the wounded soldier's breathing grew faint.

"They said after nightfall—"

Movement on the trail interrupted him. A petite figure led a small group up the slope, her medical kit casting a long shadow in the sunset.

"Luna?! Who authorized this?!" Andrew's voice held equal parts fury and fear.

She was already kneeling beside the soldier. "Any later and he'd be gone." With practiced hands, she cut away the bloodied uniform. "Prep the surgical kit."

Under the moon's glow, the final shrapnel fragment was extracted. Only when removing her gloves did Luna notice her trembling hands.

Andrew handed her a canteen. "Trouble below?"

"The prisoners talked," she said tightly. "They'd mapped defenses across five highlands."

In the moonlight, both turned toward distant flickering fires—where another allied position was enduring the same hell.
###Chapter 373: Ambush

Luna White received her orders at the break of dawn. The mountain fog hung thick and impenetrable, draping over the camp like a heavy curtain. By afternoon, a fine drizzle began to fall, soaking everyone’s clothes.

The spy incident from three days ago still weighed on everyone’s minds like a thorn. The deputy director had changed the codes overnight and increased patrols. The winding border was a hotbed for enemy activity, and they all knew this wouldn’t be the last time.

"Move out!" Captain Hank Miller commanded in a low voice. The transport team sprang into action, swiftly checking their gear. Luna and Lily Collins quickly packed their medical kits and pulled on their raincoats.

"Same highland as last time?" Lily whispered.

Luna nodded, her lips curling into an involuntary smile. Six months. Finally, she would see Andrew Smith again. Even if it was amidst gunfire, just one glimpse of him would be enough.

The march through the rainy night was grueling. Without flashlights, they relied entirely on the transport team to guide them. Luna stumbled along, nearly falling several times. Lily fared worse—once, she almost tumbled down a cliff, saved only by a soldier’s quick grab.

"Shh—" Hank suddenly raised a hand. Everyone dropped into a crouch.

On the hillside, shadowy figures moved furtively. Hunched low, they used the terrain for cover as they crept toward the highland.

"Something’s wrong," Luna murmured. "If they were ours, they wouldn’t be sneaking around like this."

Hank narrowed his eyes. "Prepare to engage. Let them get close, then we’ll trap them."

The transport team silently cocked their rifles, eyes gleaming with anticipation. Usually, they were the ones ambushed—tonight, they’d return the favor.

Luna and Lily were shielded in the center of the formation. The rain grew heavier, pelting Luna’s face until she couldn’t tell if it was rain or sweat. She clutched her medical kit, her heart pounding like a drum.

Andrew, stay safe.
###Chapter 374: Ambush in Darkness, Bloody Dawn

"Captain! Movement detected at the eastern outpost!" The sentry's hushed report came through clenched teeth, his finger taut against the trigger.

Andrew Smith narrowed his eyes, scanning the ink-black forest. The moon hid behind thick clouds, draping the mountains in an eerie silence. He pressed the walkie-talkie to his ear. "All positions, standby. The rats are out."

A damp, earthy wind swept through the trees. His team, dispersed yet synchronized, shifted into combat readiness without a word. The metallic clicks of rifle bolts echoed sharply in the night.

"After we exposed their spy last time, they're trying a night raid?" Andrew's lips curled into a cold smirk as his finger traced the tactical map. "Reroute the supply convoy. Medics, evacuate the wounded to the caves."

Within three minutes, every combatant stood ready. The chorus of bullets chambering filled the air.

"They won't repeat their mistake with the eastern cliffs," Andrew handed the night-vision scope to his lieutenant. "Focus on the high ground. Hank Miller's team must hold their position."

A sudden crack of snapping branches from the northwest froze everyone mid-breath.

"They're here." Andrew raised three fingers, then slowly folded them down one by one.

As the last finger curled, gunfire erupted across the mountainside. But the real surprise came from behind enemy lines—a second barrage of shots tore through their ranks.

"The supply team's here!" Hank's voice crackled over the radio. "Pincer attack! Don't let a single one escape!"

Over sixty enemy soldiers crumbled under the crossfire. Screams pierced the darkness as the survivors fled into the predawn gloom.

At first light, Hank charged up the slope with ammunition crates. "Perfect timing!"

But Andrew's gaze locked onto the blood-red horizon. "The storm's coming."

The first artillery shell screamed down before he finished speaking. The mountain trembled under the deafening blast.

"Barrage cover! They're pushing hard!" Hank dove for the machine gun nest.

Luna White and Lily Collins dragged the last two wounded into the caves just as explosions painted the dawn in fiery hues.

"Grenade!" Someone lunged at a tumbling package.

The detonation flung two soldiers through the air. Hank, eyes burning, filled the gap in the line. "Hold! We hold this ground!"

The second artillery wave hit harder. Shrapnel and stone rained down as shadowy figures advanced through the smoke.

Andrew spat out dirt and pulled the pin on his last grenade. "Fix bayonets!"

By full sunrise, the peak swam in acrid smoke. Inside the caves, the wounded clutched bandages, listening to the fading gunfire.


###Chapter 375: Bloodstained Uniform

The deafening roar of artillery shook the entire mountainside.

Andrew Smith barked into the radio, "All units retreat to the caves—now!" His command cut through the static with razor clarity.

Only two sentries remained on watch. The rest scrambled for cover.

The limestone caverns were nature's bomb shelters—impenetrable even under the fiercest bombardment.

"Casualty report?" Andrew's voice was gravel. A choked reply crackled through the radio: "Twelve KIA... twenty-eight critical..."

Ethan Lewis lay on a stretcher, intestines spilling from his abdomen, right leg stripped to the bone. His breathing was barely detectable.

Andrew's fists clenched. He raised binoculars to survey enemy positions—

BOOM!

An explosion hurled him backward. He tumbled into the cave's mouth, caught at the last moment by his squad.

"Captain!" The soldiers cried out.

Shrapnel jutted from his forehead, blood flooding his vision. Half an inch lower would've blinded him.

Meanwhile atop the ridge, Sean Waters coordinated defenses while Luna White and Lily Collins triaged wounded.

"Third wave repelled!" someone shouted. The artillery ceased abruptly, leaving an eerie silence.

Then the radio blared—not with Andrew's voice, but a medic's sob: "Sean! We need Luna—the captain's critical!"

Sean's stomach dropped. Andrew always led the charge. Now he couldn't even speak...

He sprinted into the cavern shouting, "Luna! The captain—"

She was already moving, medical kit slung over her shoulder. "Lead the way!"

Their six-person team raced through trenches. Strangely, no shells pursued them—as if the battlefield itself held its breath.

Fifteen minutes later, Luna burst into the cave.

Andrew lay motionless on the stretcher, his uniform saturated with blood.
###Chapter 376: Between Life and Death

"Move aside!"

Luna White nearly knocked over the soldiers gathered around the stretcher as she threw herself beside Andrew Smith. Her fingers trembled, but she forced herself to remain calm as she assessed his injuries.

The gash above his brow was horrifying, blood snaking down his temple and staining half his face crimson. Worse still, his breathing grew fainter by the second.

"Doctor, the Captain was thrown over fifteen meters by the blast..." A young soldier's voice cracked. "You have to save him!"

Luna took a deep breath and swiftly unbuttoned his combat uniform. The moment her fingertips brushed his ice-cold skin, her heart plummeted.

"Prepare the acupuncture needles," she said with eerie composure.

"But the Captain needs surgery!" The soldier stamped his foot in frustration. "He needs to stop the bleeding, he needs—"

"Shut up!" Lily Collins yanked him back. "Dr. White is the Captain's fiancée. She knows exactly what she's doing!"

Only then did the soldier notice Luna's ashen face and the slight tremor in her hands. He stepped back, chastened, but his anxious gaze remained fixed on her every move.

The silver needles glinted coldly in the firelight. Holding her breath, Luna inserted the first needle into Andrew's pressure point. In that instant, she felt an unprecedented surge of energy.

Her supernatural ability was spiraling out of control.

Her healing power rushed into Andrew's body like a breached dam, flooding his meridians with terrifying intensity. Stranger still, the energy seemed to recognize him, flowing through his veins with almost joyful familiarity.

"This can't be..." Luna's eyes widened.

She could "see" the shrapnel embedded deep in his skull—and the fractured blood vessels surrounding it. By all rights, Andrew shouldn't have survived long enough to reach the base.

Yet now, her ability was repairing the damage at an astonishing rate. The shrapnel was being pushed out by an invisible force, the wound closing before her eyes.

"The Captain's waking up!" someone shouted.

Luna looked up sharply, meeting Andrew's bloodshot eyes as they fluttered open. Those usually warm, laughing eyes now reflected her own panic-stricken face with startling clarity.

"Luna..." he whispered weakly.

She quickly pressed down his attempt to raise his hand, her peripheral vision catching the shrapnel that had fallen onto the stretcher. With practiced subtlety, she covered it with her sleeve, her pulse roaring in her ears.

This wasn't right. Her ability had never reacted like this before—as if it had always belonged to Andrew.
###Chapter 377: Life or Death

Andrew Smith's eyes snapped open, his body burning as if molten lava coursed through his veins. He could feel every wound mending—shrapnel being pushed from his brain by an invisible force, severed blood vessels reconnecting, shattered tissues regenerating at an impossible speed. But what stunned him most was seeing the source of this healing power.

Luna White stood before him.

Golden energy streams flowed back into her chest like receding tides, condensing into a faint starlight glow. Andrew's pupils constricted—this defied all logic.

At the same moment, Luna clutched her sternum. Her chest burned like a miniature sun. Despite expending massive energy, she felt no exhaustion. Instead, power surged through her fingertips.

"Luna!" Andrew struggled to sit up.

"Don't move!" She pressed him down, swiftly removing acupuncture needles before exhaling in relief.

"The Captain's awake!" A soldier's shout echoed through the cavern.

All eyes turned to them.

"Dr. White!" Lily Collins' voice trembled. "Ethan Lewis isn't breathing!"

Luna sprinted toward the motionless soldier. Andrew followed and froze—Ethan's abdomen was wrapped in blood-soaked bandages, his face ashen, chest utterly still.

Lily performed frantic CPR. Luna checked his pulse—barely detectable.

"Clear the area!" Luna barked. "You're killing him!"

Time was critical. But with so many witnesses, revealing her ability meant...

Andrew's command cut through the chaos: "All personnel evacuate! Dr. Collins tend to other wounded!" His gaze swept the group. "That's an order!"

The soldiers scattered. Lily hesitated. "Dr. White, you—"

"I'll handle this." Luna gripped her needle case, nails biting into her palms. "We have to try."

Andrew positioned himself behind her like an unshakable fortress. Luna drew a sharp breath—self-preservation or all-or-nothing gamble?

A water droplet fell from the cavern ceiling, rippling through the bloodstained puddle.
###Chapter 378: Between Life and Death

"Everyone, evacuate immediately!" Andrew Smith commanded in a low voice, his gaze sweeping over each soldier's face.

Luna White had already knelt beside Ethan Lewis, silver needles glinting coldly between her fingers. She tore open his bloodstained military uniform, revealing the horrifying wound beneath.

The cave was eerily silent, with only Andrew's steady breathing echoing in the air. He knelt on one knee beside Luna, his intense eyes fixed on her.

Luna bit her lip. That fleeting sensation couldn't have been wrong—Andrew indeed possessed some power that could alleviate the side effects of her supernatural ability. Though the reason remained unclear, saving lives took priority now.

She abruptly grabbed Andrew's hand. His large palm immediately closed around hers, warmth spreading from their intertwined fingers.

"Beginning now," Luna murmured.

The moment the needles pierced the acupuncture points, an unprecedented surge of energy erupted from within her. This time, her ability carried an almost domineering force, startling even herself.

Both of them turned their attention to Ethan.

His pallid complexion gradually regained color, his chest rising and falling steadily. Most astonishingly, the wound on his abdomen began healing at a visible rate!

Luna's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly released Andrew's hand. No—if this continued, the wound would fully close, making it impossible to explain!

As expected, the moment their connection broke, the healing slowed. But strangely, this time, she only felt a faint chill instead of the usual bone-piercing cold.

"Andrew, call Dr. Lily for sutures," Luna said without looking up. "If we work together, we can save him."

Andrew studied her deeply. "Don't push yourself." Those four simple words sent a tremor through her heart.

He had noticed.

Lily Collins rushed over, her eyes widening in shock at Ethan's condition. "Good heavens! Dr. White, your acupuncture—"

"No time for chatter. Sutures, now," Luna cut her off. "I'll handle anesthesia."

Lily sprang into action—disinfecting, threading needles, stitching—her movements fluid from months of frontline experience.

As the needles moved between pressure points, Luna could sense Ethan's vitals stabilizing. When the final stitch was tied, she finally exhaled in relief.

"Change the dressings on schedule. He'll recover," she said, withdrawing the needles, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Andrew reached out to steady her shoulder, his warmth seeping into her again. Luna looked up, meeting his profound gaze, and her heartbeat stuttered.

What unknown connection existed between them?
###Chapter 379: Silent Coordination

"Next!" Luna White wiped the sweat from her brow, the silver needle glinting coldly between her fingers.

Lily Collins passed her the sterilized cotton with practiced ease. Their eyes met briefly before falling into their familiar rhythm. Without anesthesia, Luna's needles had become the most effective pain relief. The wounded soldier clenched his teeth, but his brow smoothed the moment the needle pierced his skin.

"Wound cleaned," Lily announced, her suturing needle moving with lifelike precision as she closed the gash.

Luna pressed gently against the soldier's wrist, feeling a warm current flow through her fingertips. She could sense his immune system activating—tiny lights flickering to life within his body.

The moment Andrew Smith's orderly was carried in, both women fell silent. The mangled stump where his limb had been made Luna's hands tremble slightly.

"I'll handle the bandaging," Lily said, taking the gauze with firm yet gentle hands.

Luna took a steadying breath and inserted the needle into precise pressure points to stem the bleeding. Regrowing limbs was beyond her—such miracles had to remain impossible, for now.

By dusk, when the last wounded soldier was carried away, Luna could barely stand. She dragged her exhausted body to the cave entrance, leaning against the damp rock wall as distant artillery fire pulsed like an unending symphony of death.

"Found you." Andrew's voice came from behind, warm and familiar.

She didn't open her eyes, but she recognized the scent of gunpowder and antiseptic clinging to him. Her supernatural ability was changing—the usual bone-chilling cold after healing now felt like spring thawing winter's grip.

"Here." A cold ration biscuit was pressed into her hand.

Luna opened her eyes, Andrew's face illuminated by the intermittent glow of explosions. His stubble had grown thicker, his eyes bloodshot yet still tender.

"Have you eaten?" She broke off a small piece, her voice hoarse from exhaustion.

"Two hours ago." He gazed at the distant fires. "The mess crew says hot meals might not reach us for days."

Luna chewed the dry biscuit and suddenly laughed. "Still better than field rations."

Andrew studied her pale face, hesitating. He wanted to send her away, yet couldn't bear to end this rare moment. In the artillery's glow, her profile looked like a fading oil painting.

"Your hands..." He suddenly grasped her icy fingers.

Her pulse jumped. There was something between them—every touch sent subtle ripples through her abilities. Now, the exhaustion was ebbing away.

"I'm fine," she murmured, but her fingers tightened around his.

A sudden barrage of explosions lit the night sky, drawing their gazes upward. This war was far from over.
###Chapter 380: I Will Marry You

"Perfect, saves us from meeting like we're at war." Luna White blinked playfully, tilting her head to rest on Andrew Smith's shoulder.

Andrew's ears turned red instantly. "D-don't... people might see," he murmured, shifting half a step away yet unwilling to put real distance between them.

Luna bit her lower lip. "Aren't... you going to ask me anything?" Her fingers tightened around the hem of her shirt. The secret of her supernatural ability was out—better to lay it all bare than keep hiding.

"I'll listen if you want to tell me. If not, I'll never ask." Andrew suddenly turned, gripping her shoulders. "But promise me this stays between us—no one else, not even your closest family." His gaze held unprecedented intensity. "The more who know, the greater your danger."

In the morning light, he watched her focused profile as she nibbled on a plain bun. Her long lashes cast delicate shadows, and even the simplest ration seemed like a feast the way she ate it.

"How did you get here?" His voice tightened. "When I saw you, my heart nearly stopped."

Luna tilted her head, a sly smile playing at her lips. "I thought you'd have guessed by now."

Andrew's pupils contracted, his fists clenching audibly. "Was it... them?"

The unspoken understanding hung between them. Who else but Madam Smith, who'd been targeting them at every turn, could have arranged Luna's transfer to the frontlines?

"They want us to back down," Luna said softly, covering his trembling hand with hers. "If you hadn't come here, they might've gotten their wish by now."

"Bastards!" Andrew slammed his fist against the wall. "How dare they gamble with your life!"

Luna rested a hand on his tense back. "Look at the bright side—without them, we wouldn't have reunited here." Rising on her toes, she whispered by his ear: "This time, it's my turn to say it—if I don't make it back, marry a good woman."

Andrew whirled to face her, but her eyes glimmered with resolve. "If we both survive this..." She drew a steadying breath. "I will marry you."

Under the moonlight, their shadows merged until no line remained between them.
###Chapter 381: How Could This Be?

Andrew Smith's face was dark with fury.

Every member of the special forces team could feel the oppressive atmosphere radiating from their captain. The training ground was thick with tension, almost suffocating.

"What's wrong with the Captain today?" Private Lee whispered to Sergeant Zhang beside him.

Sergeant Zhang shook his head. "No idea. He was fine yesterday when Dr. White visited."

The soldiers exchanged glances, each speculating silently. How could gentle Dr. White possibly anger the Captain? It must be one of his moods again.

Everyone sided with Dr. White. After all, the kind-eyed female doctor had treated many of their injuries with that crescent-moon smile of hers.

Andrew stood at the center of the training field, his gaze icy.

Wei Shufen had crossed a line this time. She'd actually sent Luna to the frontlines, exposing her to gunfire and mortal danger.

His fists clenched at the thought.

A distant whistle signaled assembly. Andrew drew a deep breath. Personal matters would have to wait—with border tensions rising, they could receive orders at any moment.

But this wasn't over.

Wei Shufen had always thought Andrew was reasonable. She'd been wrong. Dead wrong.

The uniformed man stood rigid, his composure deceptively intact. But the inferno in his dark eyes would have terrified anyone who looked closely.

An observer might have noticed the veins bulging in his gun hand—the telltale sign of barely restrained rage.

Every minute Luna spent at the frontlines carved at his heart like a knife. The woman he loved was in danger, and he was powerless to protect her.

This debt would be repaid.

Someday, Wei Shufen would pay dearly.

Wei Shufen stood pale-faced in the study.

"How could this happen?" Her voice trembled. "An Cheng, why would Andrew go there?"

An Cheng remained silent, brow furrowed.

"It's a warzone now!" She stamped her foot in agitation. "He's your most capable son! How could—"

The words caught in her throat.

Her plan had been flawless. Send that little doctor to the front—either she'd break or disappear. Simple.

But now Andrew had gone too.

Everything was spiraling out of control.

A sudden fear gripped Wei Shufen. If anything happened to Andrew...

She couldn't bear to finish the thought.
###Chapter 382: Foolish Thoughts

Andrew's expression turned stern. "He's a soldier. His family name doesn't matter. He volunteered without hesitation, and I'm proud of him." Though he had personal concerns, they paled in comparison to duty.

His heart ached for his most outstanding son, yet he knew no one was more qualified than Andrew. If Andrew said he was ready, then he was. This trust stemmed from Andrew's exceptional military prowess.

"Andrew, it's too dangerous there! You—" Clara's mind was in turmoil. Andrew's deployment had upended her plans. With Diana already at the base, she'd hoped to foster a relationship between them. But how could that happen if he wasn't even there?

Worse, Andrew would discover Dr. White at the frontlines immediately. His sharp mind would see through her scheme in no time. Clara knew Andrew wasn't like his brother—his perception far surpassed ordinary men.

Regret gnawed at her. She'd shot herself in the foot. With her husband in good health, she could've rested easy. Instead, she'd practically delivered Dr. White to Andrew herself.

"Andrew, recall him now! There's still time!" Clara grabbed the phone. "If you won't call, I will!"

"Put it down!" Andrew barked.

Clara's hand jerked, nearly dropping the receiver. In all their years of marriage, he'd never spoken to her like this.

"You're being foolish!" His gaze burned. "He's a soldier first. When the nation calls, he answers. If I recall him today, what stops others from demanding the same for their sons tomorrow?"

He took a deep breath. "I believe he'll return safely. This discussion is over. Don't bring it up again."

Clara paled. It was clear she couldn't stop this. She needed an exit strategy—before Andrew returned to settle the score.
###Chapter 383: My Decision

"Andrew, there's something I've been keeping from you." Wei Shufen bit her lip, deciding to come clean. She knew her husband's temperament too well—the more she hid, the angrier he'd become.

Andrew's hand paused over the documents he was reviewing. "What is it?"

"It's about Dr. White," Wei Shufen said carefully, watching her husband's expression. "The girl our son wants to marry."

Andrew frowned. His impression of this Dr. White was terrible, thanks to his wife's constant whispers. In his mind, she was a cunning country girl who had latched onto Andrew Smith's gratitude after he saved her life, then somehow managed to become a doctor.

"What about her?" His tone was sharp.

"I transferred her to the frontline hospital," Wei Shufen blurted out. "The one near my brother's unit."

"What?" Andrew shot to his feet, papers scattering across the floor. "Have you lost your mind? That place is a death trap!"

Wei Shufen stood her ground. "I wanted her to understand that people like us aren't so easily climbed over!" She lowered her voice. "Do you know what she was doing at the local hospital? Living in the specialists' quarters, enjoying privileges meant for senior staff—a nineteen-year-old girl! Who does she think she is?"

Andrew's expression darkened. His son was risking his life on the frontlines while this girl was living it up in safety.

"Andrew, I did this for our son's sake," Wei Shufen pressed, seizing his hand. "We can't let her ruin his future."

Andrew sighed heavily. He understood his wife's concerns—being a stepmother was never easy. He'd seen the resentment his eldest son harbored toward her all these years.

"Fine," he said, patting her hand. "If Andrew asks, tell him it was my decision."

Wei Shufen's eyes lit up.

"But," Andrew added sternly, "this is the last time. Next time, you discuss it with me first."

"I promise," Wei Shufen nodded quickly, relief washing over her. This hurdle, at least, was cleared.
###Chapter 384: A Care Package Across the Miles

Luna Whitaker stood at the post office counter, her fingers trembling slightly as she filled out the parcel form with the address Ethan had left behind. She double-checked every character, afraid of making even a single mistake.

"Ma'am, are you sending all of these?" The clerk eyed the small mountain of packages with surprise.

Luna nodded. "Yes, all of them." She had carefully selected long-lasting local specialties—freshly milled millet from the village, homemade pickled radish, the region’s famous smoked sausage, and wood ear mushrooms. Every item was Luna’s favorite.

Ever since her younger sister had been transferred to that remote region, it was as if she had vanished. Aside from a brief letter confirming her safe arrival, there had been no news. Stranger still, Andrew Smith had also disappeared without a trace.

At first, Luna thought the newlyweds had quarreled. But when Ethan visited, she learned Andrew had been sent on a classified mission. The realization left her unsettled—how cruel that the couple had to separate so soon after their wedding, without even a word from each other.

"That’ll be twenty-eight pounds in total. Postage comes to twelve dollars and fifty cents." The clerk’s voice pulled her back to the present.

After paying, Luna watched blankly as the parcels were labeled and taken away. She desperately hoped her sister could taste even a spoonful of home—perhaps a simple bowl of millet porridge.

When she returned to the restaurant, Ryan Wallace was directing the staff to unload fresh ingredients. Business had boomed since opening their second location, and "The Whitaker’s" had become synonymous with hotpot in the city.

"Welcome back, boss!" Old Zhang, their produce supplier, greeted her warmly. Thanks to their partnership, he no longer had to hawk his goods at the market.

Ryan approached, noticing his wife’s somber expression. "Did you send the package?"

Luna nodded, her eyes glistening. "Do you think Luna will get it? That place is so isolated, even letters barely make it..."

Ryan wrapped an arm around her shoulders. "The post office will deliver it. When Luna gets that box, she’ll be over the moon."

The rich aroma of spicy broth wafted from the kitchen, but Luna had no appetite. She gazed out the window at the bustling crowd, envying ordinary people who could see their loved ones every day.

"By the way, we got some fresh tripe today—want to try it?" Ryan tried to distract her.

Luna forced a smile. She remembered how her sister could devour two full plates of tripe in one sitting. But now... did that place even have hotpot?

Waiters hurried between tables, the restaurant packed to capacity. None of them knew that behind their cheerful boss’s smile was a heart aching for a sister thousands of miles away.
###Chapter 385: The Announcement

"Manager White, you're back!" Old Zhang greeted with a beaming smile, carrying two baskets of fresh vegetables. He had been supplying the restaurant for years and knew the value of good service.

Luna wiped the sweat from her brow and took the baskets with a grateful nod. "Thank you, Mr. Zhang. Don’t worry about the payment—we’ll go over the invoices in the next couple of days, and I’ll settle everything right away." She had always been prompt with payments, never keeping suppliers waiting.

Old Zhang chuckled, shaking his head. "Ah, doing business with you is always a pleasure! Other restaurants drag payments for months, and when you finally ask for the money, they act like you’re robbing them..." His tone carried years of frustration.

"Stick to the agreement—you deliver on time, I pay on time. Simple as that." Luna handed the baskets to a kitchen assistant before turning back to him with a smile.

Old Zhang sighed inwardly. No wonder the White family’s restaurant thrived. The owner was fair, efficient, and kind—qualities that kept customers and suppliers loyal.

Ryan stepped out from the kitchen and spotted his wife by the entrance. He hurried over. "Luna, why are you standing out here in this heat? You should rest inside."

She shot him a playful glare. "I’m not made of glass. A little sun won’t hurt me."

Ryan scratched his head and grinned sheepishly. Lately, he’d noticed something off about her—she was always tired, and her cravings had become unpredictable. Just last night, she’d woken him up demanding spicy noodles, sending him scrambling through the streets at midnight.

"Are you feeling unwell? Maybe you should—"

"Fool!" Luna’s cheeks flushed as she lowered her voice. "I’m pregnant!"

Ryan froze, blinking. Then realization hit, and his face lit up like the sun. "Really? I’m going to be a father?"

Luna quickly covered his mouth. "Keep it down! You know how strict the family planning policies are..."

Overcome with joy, Ryan circled her twice before slapping his forehead. "I’ll go buy a chicken to make soup for you!"

"Not now!" She caught his arm, her eyes shining. "We have a restaurant to run. We’ll talk tonight."

Ryan nodded eagerly, though his grin refused to fade. At forty, he’d long given up hope of having a child of his own—until now.

"Boss, customers!" A server’s voice snapped him back to reality.

Taking a deep breath, Ryan forced himself to focus. But the happiness in his eyes was impossible to hide. He squeezed Luna’s hand and whispered, "I’ll make you soup tonight."

She smiled, nudging him away. "Go greet our guests, you big oaf."

Sunlight streamed through the windows, wrapping them in warmth. Behind the counter, Luna absently touched her stomach, her expression softening.
###Chapter 386: The Pillar

Luna Whitaker's lips had just curved into a smile when Ethan Jackson came rushing over in his usual energetic manner.

Their family now owned two thriving hot pot restaurants, with the third and fourth locations in active preparation. Following the business principles Luna White had taught them, their profits soared effortlessly past ten thousand daily, doubling during holidays.

Ethan had become the backbone of their enterprise.

He specialized in developing and preparing the hot pot broth—the soul of their business, as Luna often said. Ethan possessed a natural talent for it, not only mastering Luna's original recipes but also innovating new flavors.

A secret R&D room, strictly off-limits to outsiders, housed his creations. Ethan personally blended every batch to protect their trade secrets. His tomato broth, mushroom tonic pot, and green pepper oil variations expanded their menu, delighting customers with more choices beyond the traditional split-pot.

"Mom, Aaron and I are heading out for supplies," Ethan announced. Every ten days, he made the trip himself—never delegating the task, as ingredient quality directly affected their signature flavors.

Luna nodded. For convenience, Ethan had bought a motorcycle. If not for his age, she would've encouraged him to get a license. She'd come to realize that earning money was meant to improve their lives.

Her eldest son's diligence and capability filled her with pride.

"Be careful on the road—no speeding. It's warm out, but safety first." Luna couldn't help fussing whenever he left.

Ethan grinned. "Don't worry, Mom! Dad, we're off!"

Ryan Wallace handed him a helmet, his eyes warm with paternal affection. His three stepsons shared both a father-son bond and a brotherly camaraderie with him.

"Let your brother drive. Aaron's too reckless—last time I rode with him, he nearly gave me a heart attack." Ryan knew both boys' temperaments well.

Aaron pouted. "Dad, that was when I'd just learned! I'm way smoother now!"

"Oh? Then who knocked over a bicycle yesterday and paid a hundred in damages?" Ryan countered bluntly. "The money's nothing—I just don't want you hurt. What if you hit a car next time?"

Aaron deflated. He had no rebuttal—the incident was undeniably his fault.
###Chapter 387: Good News

"You all don't believe me!" Aaron Jackson pouted, his cheeks puffing out in frustration.

Ryan Wallace sighed and ruffled the boy's hair. "It's not that I don't trust you, son. I just worry you're too young and impulsive. You'll understand when you're older." His tone was cautious, careful not to hurt the boy's feelings.

After all, he wasn't their biological father.

Too gentle, and the kids might not take him seriously. Too harsh, and he risked damaging their bond. But in his heart, these three boys and Luna were his whole world. Even if they didn't understand now, he'd do everything a father should.

Ethan Jackson was the most dependable, but Aaron—reckless, attention-seeking, always rushing into things. If he didn't rein him in now, who knew what trouble the boy might stir up?

"I know you mean well, Dad." Aaron scratched his head, his grin returning. "Don't worry, I'll remember!" His best quality was his quick forgiveness—once things were aired out, they were forgotten.

Watching the brothers leave, Ryan sighed again. He knew them too well—Aaron would insist on driving, and Ethan would let him. This couldn't go on...

"You worry more than a real father would." Luna chuckled, massaging his temples. "Aren't you going to ask what's been up with me these days?" She blinked playfully.

Ryan grabbed her hand and pulled her onto his lap. "Luna, tell me honestly—what's wrong?" His brow furrowed. "I haven't slept well lately, terrified something's happened to you. We promised to grow old together. You can't—"

Luna burst into laughter and whispered something in his ear.

Ryan froze.

"Hey?" She poked his cheek. "Cat got your tongue?"

The next second, he swept her into his arms, spinning her around like a fool. "Sweetheart! We're keeping it!"

This was his first time being a father—his and Luna's own child. His hands trembled with excitement.

"I want to keep it too..." Luna leaned against his chest, her voice dropping. "But the one-child policy..."

Ryan's expression darkened. The penalties for violating the policy were severe—heavy fines, even forced abortions. Countless families in the village had gone into hiding just to have a son.

"Don't be afraid." He held her tightly. "Once you start showing, stay home. I'll handle everything outside. No one touches my wife or child."
###Chapter 388: Happy News

"This can't go on forever. The baby will need to be registered after birth. Why don't you talk to Uncle George? He's our godfather—he wouldn't steer us wrong." Luna Whitaker gently touched her slightly rounded belly, her brow furrowed. She hated living like a fugitive, as if having a child was something to be ashamed of.

Ryan Wallace's eyes lit up, and he immediately took his wife's hand. "Leave it to me. I'll call Uncle George right away. You just focus on resting, understand?" His rough fingers brushed over Luna's knuckles, his grin stretching ear to ear.

He was finally going to be a father!

Though he had always treated Ethan, Aaron, and Samuel Jackson as his own, what man didn’t yearn for a child of his blood? That primal instinct, carved into his bones over generations, was impossible to ignore.

And at his age? Anyone who claimed they didn’t want to be a dad was lying.

Watching her husband’s barely contained joy, warmth flooded Luna’s chest. This was worlds apart from how she’d been treated back in the Jackson household—when she’d been pregnant before, the whole family had scowled at her as if she’d committed some unspeakable crime.

This was what life was supposed to be.

She often thought of her younger sister, Luna White. If not for her encouragement and Andrew Smith’s support back then, she might have surrendered to fate long ago.

"Why’s the boss so happy today?" Jack Peterson whispered from the kitchen doorway.

The entire restaurant staff had noticed something was off. Their usually stern boss was humming under his breath today, stealing glances at his wife with a sweetness that could melt sugar.

"Could Mrs. Whitaker be expecting?" the cashier, Lisa Wilson, murmured conspiratorially.

A few bold waiters exchanged knowing looks before one finally piped up, "Boss, what’s the good news?"

Ryan, wiping down the counter, burst out laughing. "Twenty-dollar bonus for everyone this month! Keep up the good work—there’s a bigger reward at year-end!"

"Wow! Long live the boss!"

Cheers erupted through the restaurant. Dishrags and aprons flew into the air as the young staff members danced with excitement. They were all kids from Six Paths Village who’d come to the city with trepidation, half-expecting wage delays.

Who’d have thought not only would they get paid on time every month, but now bonuses too?

Ryan watched their youthful energy with a swelling heart. He was going to be a father. Life, it seemed, was only getting better.
###Chapter 389: Unexpected Joy

"Boss, why are you grinning from ear to ear today?" The waitstaff crowded around Ryan Wallace, their eyes brimming with curiosity.

Ryan waved them off. "Get back to work!" But his lips kept curling upward.

"Did Mrs. Wallace make you something delicious again?" Jack Peterson teased, wiggling his eyebrows.

Luna Whitaker happened to step out with a dish just then, her cheeks flushing at the remark. "Stop talking nonsense!"

Ryan pulled his wife into a hug. "Can't I just be happy looking at my beautiful wife?"

"Aww!" The staff erupted in playful cheers.

Luna stomped her foot in embarrassment but didn’t push him away. Ever since they'd received the news, Ryan had been floating on air.

At three in the afternoon, Ryan rushed to the post office.

"Uncle George!" he blurted as soon as the call connected.

"What's wrong? Did something happen to Lily?" George Clark's voice tightened.

"No, no! It's good news! Amazing news!"

"What could be so important you'd waste money on this call?" George sighed in relief.

Ryan took a deep breath. "Uncle, Luna's pregnant."

Silence stretched for two seconds.

"You lucky dog!" George suddenly roared with laughter. "I always said you'd get your blessings!"

Ryan scratched his head. "But the family planning policy—"

"Don't worry about that!" George cut him off. "Luna's remarried—the policy allows another child. I'll get your birth permit sorted right away!"

Ryan's eyes burned. "Really?"

"Would I lie to you?" George boomed. "Just wait—I'm heading to the commune office now!"

Hanging up, Ryan stood outside the post office, grinning like a fool. Passersby gave him odd looks.

Back at the diner, Luna was wiping down tables.

"Luna!" Ryan bounded over in three strides. "We can get the birth permit!"

The cloth slipped from Luna's fingers. "Really?"

"Absolutely!" He scooped her up and spun her around. "Our baby will be legitimate!"

"Put me down!" She swatted at him, but her smile betrayed her joy.

The staff peeked from the kitchen doorway, exchanging knowing glances.

Looks like the diner would soon have a little boss.
###Chapter 390: Turmoil

George Clark hung up the phone, grinning from ear to ear. Hands clasped behind his back, he hummed a tune as he strolled home.

Villagers greeted him along the way: "Mayor Clark, what's got you so cheerful?"

"Nothing much," he waved them off, though inwardly he was delighted. Not only were Ryan Wallace and Luna White thriving in the city, but his own daughter was benefiting too. That clever girl had become a seamstress there, and by all accounts, business was booming.

Thinking of his daughter's letter, George couldn't help but chuckle. She'd always been deft with her hands, far surpassing the village women at needlework. Now, under Luna's wing, her life was flourishing.

He was just pondering how to share the news with his wife when someone came rushing toward him in a panic. "Mayor! Trouble! The White household is at it again!"

George's head throbbed instantly. That family never knew peace!

"What now?" he asked, frowning.

"You'd better come quick—it might turn deadly!"

With a sigh, George followed the messenger toward the White residence, grumbling internally: The Whites had caused nothing but chaos all year.

Back in spring, they'd scrambled to gather dowry money for Ethan White's wedding, sinking deep into debt. The bride's mother, Mrs. Wilson, had fixated on the payment, refusing to let her daughter Lisa marry until every penny was accounted for. In the end, Jack White had borrowed desperately to bring Lisa into the family.

But Lisa Wilson proved even more troublesome. The moment she crossed the threshold, she'd demanded the household split—insisting she and Ethan leave to find work, claiming they could earn a fortune elsewhere.

Ethan, spineless as ever, obeyed his wife without question. The couple stirred up such a storm that the entire White household was thrown into disarray.

Eventually, they discovered the brutal truth: Neither the house nor the land actually belonged to Jack White. If they split now, they'd have nowhere to go. Lisa suggested moving back to her parents' home, but Ethan flat-out refused.

The scandal had spread like wildfire through the village.

Lisa finally quieted down—because she got pregnant. Now five months along, she was being treated like royalty in the White home.

George shook his head as he walked: That family truly never knew peace.
###Chapter 391: Disdain

"What's the White family up to now?" Mayor George Clark scratched his head in frustration.

Ever since becoming the village mayor, he'd been constantly dealing with the Whites' drama. Their household caused more commotion than the village loudspeaker.

"Mayor! Jack White's son-in-law just showed up with a gang!" Neighbor Walter panted as he ran over. "They're saying Maya White cracked her husband's skull, stole his money, and ran off. Now they're here looking for trouble!"

Walter groaned inwardly. Of all the houses, why did his have to share a crumbling wall with the Whites? If a fight broke out, his property would be the first casualty.

George sighed. "Since when did Maya have that kind of guts?"

Couldn't the Whites go one week without causing a scene? While other families were figuring out how to prosper, this household specialized in chaos.

But as mayor, he had no choice.

The moment he reached the White residence, shouting erupted from inside. Villagers formed three concentric circles of spectators who quickly parted when they saw him.

"Mayor! You must help us!" Clara White lunged at him, her greasy hair flying and body reeking of sour sweat. "Frank Harris is bullying our Six Paths Village! My daughter's life is in danger because of him!"

George sidestepped just in time, nearly gagging at the stench.

When had Clara become this filthy? Stains covered her clothes, her hair resembled a bird's nest—she looked like a beggar.

"Speak properly. No need for physical contact." He covered his nose and took two steps back.

Clara stumbled forward, barely catching herself. After a stunned pause, her face flushed crimson.

He was disgusted by her!

Rage simmered in her chest. If that old hag hadn't forced her to live by the pigpen, would she be in this state? The family's debts meant they couldn't even afford soap. She worked dawn till dusk without a hot meal.

She'd thought having a daughter-in-law would ease her burdens. But Lisa Wilson was lazier than her, ordering her around while flaunting her pregnancy. Ethan White, that ungrateful son, doted on his wife and ignored his own mother.

Worst of all was Jack White—he wouldn't even look at her anymore. Who was she supposed to dress up for?
###Chapter 392: Frank Harris Gets His Comeuppance

"Stop this at once!"

George Clark's thunderous shout froze everyone in the courtyard.

The White family's yard lay in ruins. Shards of glass littered the ground, several water vats smashed beyond recognition. Muddy water mixed with soil flowed freely across the compound. Jack White crouched in a corner, clutching his swollen forehead. Ethan White and Sean White were pinned against the wall, their clothes torn to shreds, faces bruised purple and blue.

Lisa Wilson hid inside, arms wrapped protectively around her belly, face drained of color. A leering thug blocked the doorway, eyeing her with ill intent.

Frank Harris lounged on a bench, legs crossed, a cigarette dangling from his lips.

"Keep smashing!" He blew smoke rings, snarling. "Maya can run but she can't hide! Hand her over today or I'll burn this place down!"

Several men raised their clubs again.

"Try it!" George Clark strode into the yard, his gaze sharp as lightning. "Committing daylight robbery? Want to spend years behind bars?"

The mob instantly deflated.

Frank nearly toppled off his seat.

"Who the hell are you?" He jutted his chin defiantly. "I'm here for my wife—that's my right!"

Rage simmered in his gut.

This past year had been hell for Frank. First, the final fallout with his uncle Jonathan Ferguson. Initially, he'd congratulated himself for ditching deadweight. But soon came news—his uncle opened a shop in town, recovered from illness, with all three daughters helping out.

Worse, his uncle bought each daughter a television set and gifted their husbands motorcycles. Villagers spoke of it with shining eyes. Rumor had it the Fergusons now lived in a two-story house, thriving.

Frank tasted bitter regret.

His uncle had once treated him like a son. If only he hadn't...

Swallowing pride, he'd attempted reconciliation—only to be rebuffed. His uncle swore he'd rather die unmourned than raise an ungrateful wretch.

Furious yet powerless, Frank's lavish spending soon left him penniless. When Maya refused him money, he'd beaten her. Recently, she'd seemed tamed—he thought his fists had finally worked.

Until...

"Mayor! Justice!" Jack White suddenly lunged, clutching George's leg. "This monster is destroying our home!"

Frank's face darkened.

He hadn't come just for Maya today...
###Chapter 393: Debt Payment

Maya White had changed recently.

Frank Harris squatted at the village entrance, a cigarette dangling from his lips as he squinted into the distance. The gossip from the village busybuzzes buzzed in his ears like flies.

"Heard Maya's been cozy with that mountain goods dealer, David Zhao..."

"Just yesterday, I saw them in the cornfield..."

He flung the cigarette butt to the ground and crushed it under his heel. His luck had been rotten lately, leaving him drowning in debt. The loan sharks hounded him daily, forcing him to avoid his own home.

"Frank, how about..." The loan shark, Walter Taylor, rubbed his hands together with a sly grin. "You hand over your wife instead?"

Frank's eyes lit up.

Maya, that barren hen, was just wasting food anyway. He calculated—this would clear his debts and squeeze another dowry payment from the Whites.

"Deal!"

That night, Frank came home uncharacteristically bearing liquor and food. Maya stiffened at the stove when she saw him.

"Sweetheart, let's have a drink tonight." His smile was greasy.

Three rounds in, Frank finally revealed his hand: "Walter's coming for you tomorrow."

The bowl in Maya's hands shattered on the floor.

"Frank Harris! Are you even human?" She erupted, snatching the fire poker and swinging. "I'll kill you!"

Caught off guard, Frank's vision went black.

When he came to, the house was empty. Not only was Maya gone, but the $500 deposit from Walter had vanished too.

"That bitch!" Clutching his bleeding forehead, he staggered outside.

He had to find Maya. Otherwise, Walter would skin him alive.

When the White family's gate was kicked open, Luna White was hanging laundry in the yard.

"Hand over Maya!" Frank barged in with a gang of thugs, his eyes bloodshot.

Luna's basin clattered to the ground. Only then did she realize her sister hadn't come home.

Meanwhile, Maya sat on a tractor bound for the provincial capital. David Zhao's arm around her shoulders, he vowed, "Don't worry. I'll take care of you in the city."

Maya clutched the $600 in her sweaty palm. She didn't know what the future held, but at least she'd never be beaten again.

The wind tossed her hair, carrying away the nightmare of that village.
###Chapter 394: The Guilty Party Files First

"Frank Harris! My daughter's vanished without a trace, and you dare come demanding her from me?" Haofen planted her hands on her hips, her voice shaking the courtyard walls. "Hand my girl over today, or I swear you'll regret it!"

Mayor George Clark entered to this chaotic scene, his frown deep enough to crush flies. Jack White and his two sons were pinned to the ground by several thugs, their faces already bruised.

"Enough!" George's roar made the loan sharks immediately release their grip.

Jack scrambled behind the mayor like a drowned rat, his clothes covered in footprints. "Mayor, you must uphold justice! Frank brought his men to vandalize our home and slander my daughter—"

"Bullshit!" Frank kicked over a water vat, sending splashes across the yard. "Maya stole six hundred dollars from me and ran off! Hand her over, or I'll burn this house down!"

His gang jeered in agreement: "Scamming us with a sham marriage!"

"Give her back!"
"Pay up!"

Ethan White clutched his swollen jaw, shrinking back, while his brother Aaron cowered like a quail. Jack knew the truth—that wretched girl Maya had surely fled again. He'd seen it coming ever since she'd been caught stealing money last time.

But admitting it meant paying compensation. The old woman guarded their savings like her life depended on it. If she learned they'd have to fork out money, she'd skin him alive.

"My poor, doomed daughter..." Jack suddenly beat his chest and collapsed to the ground in a theatrical wail. "Frank Harris, you devil! You murdered my girl and now play the victim! Mayor, hear me—my daughter suffered two miscarriages in just six months of marriage from his beatings..."

The gathered villagers gasped. Everyone knew Frank was a brute, but Jack had always been a silent pushover. This shrewish performance was astonishing.

George's face darkened. Both families were trouble, but... He caught Jack's meaningful glance and immediately understood the game.

"Frank Harris!" The mayor's voice cut through the noise. "Where's your proof Maya ran away?"
###Chapter 395: Backing Down

Frank Harris's face turned ashen as he realized the White family was about to turn the tables on him.

"Shut your damn mouth, White!" He slammed his fist on the table, sending teacups rattling. "The whole village knows your daughter ran off with some man! Now you're accusing me of murder? Bullshit!"

Rolling up his sleeves, he revealed the tattoos on his arms. "Pay up or hand her over. No way you're walking away from this debt!"

George Clark, the mayor, frowned and stepped in front of Jack White. "What? You looking for a fight?"

"Enough!" The mayor's roar silenced the room. "Everyone's got their own version of the truth, and I'm not the judge here. I'm calling the police—let them sort this out."

He pulled out an old Nokia phone and made a show of dialing. "Frank, you said she's missing? Perfect, the cops can help find her. And if the Whites are accusing you of foul play, that needs investigating too. Anyone throws another punch, you’ll answer to me."

Frank deflated instantly.

The last thing he wanted was police scrutiny. His gambling debts, the illegal loans, and his plans to sell off his wife—none of it could stand the light of day.

"This—this is bullying!" His voice wavered. "I’ll... I’ll get my parents to deal with you!"

His thugs, sensing trouble, melted into the crowd—one pretending to tie his shoelaces, another lighting a cigarette, all vanishing within seconds.

Frank turned to flee.

"Stop!" Clara White lunged at him. "Give me back my daughter, or I swear I’ll have you arrested!"

George Clark sighed, glancing at Jack’s bruised face. "Everyone, go home. Nothing more to see here."

The villagers scattered, though not without craning their necks for one last look.

"Mayor!" Clara grabbed his sleeve. "You have to help us!"

"Help with what?" He shook her off. "Find your daughter. If she really did run away, you’ve got bigger problems than pride."

With that, he walked off, leaving the Whites stunned.

Frank didn’t stop running until he was well out of sight. Leaning against a wall, gasping for air, he fumbled for his phone, hands still shaking.

"Hey, Boss... About the money—I’ll have it in a couple days, I swear..."
###Chapter 396: No Money, No Life

Hao Fen watched as Mayor George Clark walked away without a second glance, her heart aching as if slashed by a knife.

When Luna White had been wronged, the mayor had immediately rallied the villagers to defend her, ready to beat the offenders to a pulp. But now that her own daughter, Maya White, was in trouble, he simply dismissed them with a few words and left.

The difference in treatment couldn't have been more obvious!

If George Clark knew what Hao Fen was thinking, he would have spat in her face.

Who was Luna? A good girl he'd watched grow up. And what was Maya? She wasn’t even fit to be compared to Luna.

Trembling, Hao Fen reached for Jack White’s sleeve but quickly withdrew her hand. The whole family despised her now. If she hadn’t shamelessly begged for food from the neighbors, she would have starved on the streets long ago.

"Husband, about Maya—" Before she could finish, Jack shot her a furious glare.

"Shut up! This is all because of the daughter you raised!" Jack stomped his foot in anger. "Didn’t you hear? Frank Harris came demanding his wife back! From now on, no one mentions Maya again. We say she was lost on the Harris family’s watch!"

Just thinking about his daughter made Jack seethe. She had thrown away a decent life to run off with some scoundrel. Now, she’d dragged the whole family into disgrace.

"You dare blame me?" Hao Fen’s eyes reddened. "Where were you when Maya was beaten? Did you care when she miscarried? Now that she’s gone, all you care about is money!"

From inside the house, Lisa Wilson’s mocking voice chimed in: "Who can we blame when your daughter ran off with another man? The Harris family already said she eloped with some outsider. Tsk, tsk. If there wasn’t something fishy going on, why would Frank be wearing that cuckold’s badge?"

Jack exploded with rage and kicked Hao Fen to the ground.

"From now on, anyone who mentions that disgrace gets their legs broken!" He glared around the room. "If the Harris family comes making trouble, we say they lost her. No money, no life! Let them find her themselves if they dare!"


###Chapter 397: Mob Justice

Clara White sat cross-legged on the kang, listening to the commotion outside with a cold smirk.

She had finally seen through it all—her second son's family was rotten to the core. Like father, like son. The couple was despicable, and their children were no better.

How had she ever been blind enough to think they were the most filial?

The old woman stubbornly refused to leave, her heart boiling with resentment. She felt no guilt toward Luna—after all, she wasn’t her real granddaughter. But thinking of Ethan, Iris, and the others, a twinge of remorse pricked at her.

She couldn’t bring herself to live with Ethan’s family. Pride and bitterness kept her rooted here. After pouring her heart out for her youngest son all these years, only to end up like this—who could accept it?

No, she would stay and watch. She’d see what became of this wretched family.

Besides, they owed her. Every penny she’d squeezed from her eldest son had gone to them. Now they wanted to cast her aside? Not a chance.

The angrier she grew, the more satisfaction she took from the chaos outside.

Meanwhile, Frank Harris returned to the village, covered in dust and grime.

Before he even reached his doorstep, he spotted a crowd gathered outside his courtyard, gawking at the spectacle. Fury erupted in his chest. "What the hell are you all staring at? Got nothing better to do? Scram! Get the hell out of here!"

Lately, nothing had gone his way, and his temper was a lit fuse.

The moment he stepped into the yard, his legs nearly gave out. The loan sharks were waiting.

The place was a wreck—tables, chairs, everything smashed to pieces. His parents and grandparents cowered in a corner, trembling.

Frank instantly plastered on a servile grin. He was all bark with the weak, but against these thugs, he was spineless.

"Boss, please, just calm down. I’ll get that bitch back, I swear. Give me a few more days—"

"Shut your damn mouth!" The leader of the gang waved a hand. "Teach him what happens when you don’t pay your debts!"

Seven or eight men surged forward, fists and boots flying.

Frank howled in pain.

His grandparents and parents wrung their hands in distress, but the glint of metal rods kept them rooted in place.

The old woman wiped her tears, helpless as she watched her precious grandson take the beating.
###Chapter 398: I Have Money

"Boss! Please, have mercy!" Frank Harris scrambled forward on his knees, clutching the leader's leg desperately. His entire body ached, tears and snot smeared across his face.

He'd do anything to survive.

"Mercy?" The leader kicked him away. "You owe us five thousand. We agreed your wife would cover the debt, but she ran. Who else should we come after?" These loan sharks were even more ruthless than the last group.

Frank cursed Maya White a thousand times in his mind. That bitch had escaped fast, leaving him to suffer.

If Maya could hear him, she'd sneer: Stay and let you sell me?

"Boss, just give me two days! I'll—I'll get the money!" Frank's eyes darted around. He planned to buy time, then slip away at night.

The city was vast—there had to be a place for him. Once he made it big, this debt would be nothing.

"Bullshit!" The leader slapped him hard. "Your wife's gone. If you run too, who pays? Your parents don't owe us!" He jerked his chin at his men. "Break his legs. Let's see him run then."

Thugs closed in, wooden bats thudding against the ground.

Frank trembled violently.

"No! Wait!" He scrambled backward, shrieking. "I have money! My uncle's rich! He owns a shop in town!" In desperation, he threw his uncle under the bus.

The leader stomped on his chest. "That uncle disowned you years ago. The whole village knows!" They'd done their homework before lending—knew exactly who to squeeze.

In this business, you didn't gamble. Soft targets like Frank? Crush them without hesitation.
###Chapter 399: Exposing the Scheme

"My grandparents will get the money from my uncle!" Frank Harris declared, his face swollen but his voice defiant. "I'm the only male heir of the Ferguson family. Uncle Jonathan still needs me to carry on the family line!"

A pang of regret hit him as he remembered how good Jonathan had been to him. No matter how much debt he racked up, hadn’t his uncle always bailed him out? If only he’d swallowed his pride earlier, he wouldn’t be lying beaten on the ground now.

"Don’t worry, boss! I’ll go to town right now and get the money from Uncle Jonathan!" Frank forced a sycophantic grin, fresh blood seeping from the split in his lip.

The loan shark took a drag from his cigarette, eyeing him skeptically. "Oh? Suddenly so eager?" He jerked his chin, and two burly men immediately seized Frank by the arms.

"Wait, boss!" Frank panicked. "I—I’m just thinking of your best interest—"

"Cut the crap!" The boss slammed a heavy hand on his shoulder, nearly knocking him over. "Old man, old woman, your grandson stays here as collateral. If the money’s not here by sundown..." He deliberately trailed off, hefting the iron rod in his hand.

The old woman’s legs buckled, and she nearly collapsed. "Don’t hurt him! We’ll go right now!"

Her husband steadied her, his clouded eyes filled with despair. Only now did they realize how comfortable life had been when their second son had always been there to clean up Frank’s messes. But now...

"If Jonathan refuses, we’ll die on his doorstep!" the old man growled. It was their last bargaining chip.

Frank’s parents tried to follow, but the thugs blocked them.

"Trying to run?" The boss kicked over a stool. "Go! Kill a chicken and cook for my men! If my boys go hungry, you’ll regret it!"

The house erupted into chaos. Frank was shoved into a corner, forced to watch as his parents were ordered to catch a chicken. His favorite speckled hen flapped wildly, fleeing across the yard.

Outside, the elderly couple hobbled toward town, leaning on each other for support. The setting sun stretched their shadows long and thin, like two gnarled vines.
###Chapter 400: Debt Collectors at the Door

"Hurry up! Get those chickens out!" Scarface kicked the chicken coop viciously.

The elderly couple trembled as they opened the coop door, releasing a flurry of panicked hens. The old woman wiped her tears—these were her prized laying hens.

"Quit stalling!" Another thug overturned the coop entirely.

Feathers flew as the chickens scattered. The old man stumbled after them, nearly falling before his wife caught him. Their eyes met, both filled with helpless despair.

"This is a curse..." the old woman muttered under her breath.

If only their worthless son hadn’t brought this upon them. And that wretched Maya—had she not run off, these debt collectors wouldn’t be here now.

"Let’s go to town," the old woman said shakily, pulling herself up. "We’ll ask Jonathan for help."

The aroma of dumplings filled Jonathan Ferguson’s courtyard.

"Dad, try this filling—is it seasoned right?" His eldest daughter held a freshly wrapped dumpling to his lips.

Jonathan took a bite and grinned. "Delicious! No one makes them like you."

His three daughters visited often now, always laden with gifts. Their husbands were just as diligent, fixing the roof, unclogging drains, keeping the house in perfect order.

"Mom, you look pale. Did you stay up again?" The eldest frowned at her mother.

Maya Young waved her off. "Just watched TV too late." She lowered her voice. "Your father’s hooked on that new drama—stays up till midnight every night."

Laughter echoed from inside the house, three generations gathered in warmth. Then—

BANG! BANG! BANG!

The gate shuddered under violent pounding.

"Jonathan! Jonathan, please!" A desperate wail cut through the cozy scene.

The rolling pin clattered from the eldest daughter’s hands. Jonathan’s face darkened. That voice—his good-for-nothing brother, here to beg for money again.

Maya gripped her husband’s arm before he could rise. "Not this time. We can’t give in."

Outside, the pleas grew frantic, mingled with rough male shouts. Their granddaughter buried her face in her mother’s skirt, frightened.

Jonathan drew a slow breath. Three peaceful months—shattered in an instant.
###Chapter 401: My Daughter, My Rules

"Jonathan! It's an emergency! If you don't help, our family is finished!" The shrill voice of Eleanor Ferguson echoed through the yard before she even stepped through the gate.

Maya Young paused kneading dough in the kitchen. Her in-laws hadn't visited since their explosive argument three months ago.

"Mom, it's Grandma and Grandpa," her eldest daughter Luna said, setting down the kitchen knife and wiping her hands.

Maya sighed. "Nothing good ever follows that voice."

She knew exactly why they'd come. With that gambling addict Sean still living under their roof, trouble was inevitable. Thank God she'd cut ties when she did, or they'd be bankrupt by now.

"Let's go see what they want." Dusting flour from her hands, Maya led Luna into the courtyard.

Eleanor sat weeping on the stone bench while Walter stood sighing nearby. Spotting them, the old woman's eyes narrowed.

"Why's Luna here? A married daughter belongs with her husband's family! What will people say?"

Jonathan Ferguson's face darkened. "Mom! My daughter stays as long as she pleases! State your business or leave. We've no patience for your nonsense today."

Eleanor's face turned purple with rage. Her obedient second son now dared defy her—for that worthless girl!

"How dare you! I'm your mother! Can't I discipline my own grandchild?" She slapped her thighs, ready to launch into one of her performances.

Walter urgently tugged her sleeve. They needed money today—starting a fight would ruin everything.

Maya watched coldly. These sudden visits always meant one thing: more trouble from good-for-nothing Sean. After being refused last time, what fresh scheme had they concocted?

"Grandma, Grandpa, let's talk inside," Luna offered, reaching to help Eleanor up. "The sun's too harsh out here."

The old woman shoved her away. "Keep your fake kindness!"

Jonathan immediately stepped between them. "That's enough, Mother! Leave now if you can't behave!"

Seeing the situation deteriorating, Walter blurted out, "Son, your brother—"

Before he could finish, frantic footsteps pounded through the gate. A bloodied man staggered in and collapsed at Jonathan's feet.

"Brother! Save me!"
###Chapter 402: What's Divorce?

The elderly woman suddenly snapped out of her daze.

She wasn't here to put on airs. If she pushed Jonathan too far, they'd be the ones suffering in the end. With a huff, she clamped her mouth shut.

Jonathan exchanged a glance with Maya. "Sweetheart, mind the store. I need to talk with my parents inside."

He wanted to spare Maya from their temper.

Maya shot him a warning look—don't you dare play the fool again.

Warmth spread through Jonathan's chest. His wife was worried about him. He'd been such an idiot before, leaving her with these deep-seated fears.

"Let's talk in the backyard. Too many ears out here," he said, leading his parents away.

Their eldest daughter didn't follow.

Why invite trouble? Those old-fashioned folks only valued sons. She'd rather stay with her mother.

Maya wiped down the shelves with a cloth.

"What do you think your grandparents want this time?"

The girl smirked. "What else? That ungrateful cousin probably messed up again, and they want Dad to clean up the mess." The whole lazy bunch always came running to her father when trouble hit.

"You don't think your father will soften, do you? I can't stand your grandmother's dramatics..." Maya fretted. Their good life had just begun—she refused to go back to the old days.

"Relax, Mom! Dad's changed. And even if he wobbles, didn't you say you'd divorce him if he helped them again?" The girl winked mischievously.

The toddler in her arms looked up. "Grandma, what's divorce?"

Maya's cheeks flushed. "Ask your mother!"

The daughter laughed, pinching her child's cheek. "It's when Grandma refuses to cook for Grandpa anymore."

"Oh!" The child nodded sagely. "Then you're divorced from Daddy now! You never cook for him!"

Maya burst out laughing. Served her right!

The daughter doubled over with laughter, covering her child in kisses.

Their joy floated through the courtyard, reaching the house.

The elderly couple frowned.

How could they laugh when the family was in crisis?

Proof that adopted children would never be like blood relatives.

But Jonathan's heart warmed.

He'd learned his lesson—daughters were just as precious as sons.

Having suffered enough from such outdated notions, he'd never let the next generation endure the same.
###Chapter 403: Blood Runs Thicker Than Water

"Mom, Dad, what brings you here unannounced?" Jonathan Ferguson set down his ledger and regarded the elderly couple before him with calm detachment. "If this is about someone else's business, save your breath. You know better than anyone."

He rose and walked to the shop entrance, gazing at the bustling street outside.

"Who was it that threw me out when I was bedridden, unable to even lift a cup of water?" His voice was soft but each word cut like a blade. "If not for my daughters selling everything to pay for my treatment, if not for my son-in-law financing this shop, I'd have starved on the streets long ago."

The old woman's face twisted as her cane struck the floor with a sharp crack. "Jonathan! Are you trying to kill your own mother?"

"Don't upset yourself, Mother." Jonathan turned, a faint smile playing on his lips. "I'm simply stating facts. That house was built brick by brick with my savings. And what did you do? Forced me to sign disownment papers when I was at death's door, leaving me without even a roof over my head."

The old man finally spoke up: "Jonathan, no parents are ever truly wrong—"

"Father!" Jonathan's sudden raised voice made several customers turn their heads. "You're absolutely right. No parents are ever wrong. Isn't that why I'm standing here alive and well today?"

Tears streamed down the old woman's face. "Ungrateful wretch!"

"Ungrateful?" Jonathan pulled a ledger from the counter drawer. "These are records of the monthly allowance I've sent you both since last year—not a single payment missed. Tell me, what other disowned son would do that?"

The old man's expression shifted. He lowered his voice: "Jonathan... it's about your nephew Sean. He's in trouble..."

Jonathan suddenly laughed, a sound that chilled the elderly couple to their bones.

"I knew it." He slowly closed the ledger. "Every time you visit, it's either for my eldest brother's family or my youngest brother's. How much this time? Five thousand? Ten?"

The old woman stamped her foot in agitation. "Sean borrowed from loan sharks! They'll chop his hands off!"

"And?" Jonathan's eyes turned glacial. "You want me to save some outsider who's bullied my daughters since they were children?"

"He's your blood nephew!" The old man slammed his fist on the counter.

Jonathan walked slowly to his parents and abruptly knelt, knocking his forehead against the floor three times with audible thuds.

"Mom, Dad, I'll never forget the debt I owe you for giving me life." When he raised his head, his forehead bore a red mark. "But some lessons only need learning once. The day you chose to abandon me, you should have foreseen this."

The old man trembled with rage. "You... you heartless beast!"

"Yes, I'm a beast." Jonathan stood, brushing dust from his knees. "But this beast sends you monthly allowances without fail. Meanwhile, your precious sons and grandsons have you begging the 'beast' you cast out for money."

Outside, Maya and their daughters listened from behind the door. The eldest daughter bit her lip hard, eyes red-rimmed.

"Dad..." she whispered, but her sister squeezed her hand in warning.

Jonathan's voice carried clearly from inside: "I'll give you the money. But after this, we're square."

A glint flashed in the old man's clouded eyes. "You mean it?"

"Of course." Jonathan turned to the safe and retrieved a stack of bills. "Five thousand here. Take it and don't come back."

The old woman snatched the money, counting it feverishly. "It's all here, old man!"

Watching his parents' elation, Jonathan felt an overwhelming weariness.

"Go now." He turned toward the back room. "Take care... from now on."

The elderly couple hurried away without a backward glance, clutching their windfall. Maya finally rushed in and embraced her husband.

"Jonathan..."

"It's alright." He patted her back, voice hoarse. "Now we're truly parentless."

Their eldest daughter approached with a steaming cup, eyes glistening. "Dad, you still have us."

Jonathan accepted the tea and suddenly smiled. "Yes, I have you. That's enough."

Outside, the setting sun stretched the shadows of the family across the shop floor, long and unbroken.
###Chapter 404: A Lesson Well Learned

The elderly couple gazed at Jonathan Ferguson with pleading eyes, their glances sweeping across the spacious, well-lit living room. The LCD television, double-door refrigerator, and leather sofa—each item was clearly expensive. The interior decoration alone must have cost tens of thousands.

"Jonathan, Sean is really in trouble this time..." The old woman rubbed her hands together, her voice tinged with ingratiation.

Jonathan took a slow sip of tea. "Mom, Dad, have you lost your senses? It's my duty to take care of you two, but I've never heard of anyone being responsible for their nephew."

The old man's face darkened. "How can you say that? Sean is the only male heir left in the Ferguson family!"

"Male heir?" Jonathan scoffed. "A gambling addict like him deserves that title? I already paid off his thirty-thousand-dollar debt last time—out of respect for you two. And now he needs another five thousand?"

The old woman stomped her foot anxiously. "Those men said they'd break his legs if he doesn't pay!"

"Good!" Jonathan slammed his palm on the coffee table. "Maybe that'll teach him a lesson! You two need to stop coddling him. A man in his thirties, lazing around all day—what kind of life is that?"

The old man stared at his son in shock. Was this really the same meek Jonathan they knew?

"How... how can you be so heartless? He's your own nephew!" The old man's voice trembled.

Jonathan stood up, looking down at his parents. "My daughter is about to start college, and my grandson's tutoring fees aren't cheap. Every penny I have needs to be spent wisely."

Suddenly, the old woman dropped to her knees. "Jonathan, I'm begging you—"

"Mom!" Jonathan yanked her back to her feet, his tone turning icy. "The more you enable him, the more useless Sean will become. Let me make this clear—I won't give him a single cent!"

The old man trembled with rage. "You... you'd let him die?"

Jonathan turned toward the door. "He won't die. A broken leg might keep him at home instead of causing more trouble." He pulled the door open and gestured for them to leave. "Mom, Dad, I won't see you out."

The elderly couple exchanged stunned glances. It finally dawned on them—their son was no longer the pushover they once knew.
###Chapter 405: Filing a Police Report

"Jonathan, have you no conscience? He's your own nephew! If you refuse to help him today, I'll smash my head against your doorstep and let the whole neighborhood see how you drove your own mother to her grave!" The old woman resorted to her usual theatrics, her wrinkled face twisted with fury.

The old man stood silently by, knowing full well that since Jonathan had changed, his wife's usual tricks wouldn't work anymore.

Jonathan's lips curled into a cold smile. "Mother, are you really going to kill yourself?" His voice was light, but his eyes were icy.

She was willing to go this far for Sean?

He couldn't understand what was so special about that worthless nephew of his. How could his own mother value a good-for-nothing grandson over her own son?

"Yes! I'll die right in front of you!" The old woman jutted out her chin defiantly, as if she had nothing left to lose.

She knew this was the one thing he used to fear.

"Luna, come in!" Jonathan suddenly called toward the door.

His eldest daughter stepped inside. "Dad, what is it?"

"Go to the police station and file a report. Tell them there’s illegal gambling and loan-sharking going on, and it’s about to turn deadly. Give them Grandma’s address—it falls under the town precinct." His words were slow and deliberate.

Luna froze.

"Now!" Jonathan barked.

Snapping out of her shock, she turned to leave.

A police report?

Perfect!

If they could lock Sean up, their lives would finally be peaceful.

The old woman grabbed her granddaughter’s sleeve. "Don’t you dare!"

"Mother, weren’t you just threatening to kill yourself? Fine. The moment you’re gone, I’ll report it. I’ll tell them Sean’s loan sharks drove his own grandmother to suicide." Jonathan’s gaze was merciless. "Then you can watch from the afterlife as that bastard’s life is ruined."

This time, he was dead serious.

His parents had lost their minds, throwing away a good life just to indulge Sean’s recklessness.

"Jonathan, are you trying to kill your own nephew?" The old man finally spoke up.

If this kept up, the police would come.

Even if they didn’t arrest Sean immediately, the loan sharks would never let him off the hook. Jonathan’s move was cutting off Sean’s last escape route.

"Father, whoever makes my family suffer will suffer worse." Jonathan’s tone was calm, but every word was a blade.

He wasn’t the pushover he used to be.

"Jonathan, I never should’ve—" The old woman started to spit venom.

"Enough!" The old man cut her off sharply.

No matter what, Jonathan was still their son. The old man knew the truth—when they grew too old to care for themselves, they’d have to rely on him. Their eldest son was unreliable, and Sean was nothing but trash.

"Fine. If Jonathan won’t help, we’re leaving." The old man turned and walked out without another glance.

The old woman hurried after him. "But Sean—"

Without the money, those loan sharks would kill him!

"He dug his own grave. We’re too old to clean up his mess." The old man gritted his teeth as he crossed the threshold.

The old woman turned back and spat at Jonathan before finally leaving.

Jonathan wiped his face and said nothing.

She was still his mother, after all.
###Chapter 406: No Money, Just My Life

The setting sun cast long shadows as the elderly couple trudged wearily toward their courtyard gate.

Raucous laughter and the clinking of liquor bottles spilled from within. The old woman hesitated at the door, but her husband shoved it open without pause.

The room was thick with smoke. Frank Harris lay hogtied in a corner, his face bruised and swollen. His parents were conspicuously absent—likely hiding elsewhere.

Several burly men were gathered around the low table, playing drinking games amid piles of chicken bones and peanut shells. The old man's eyes immediately locked onto two empty bottles of premium liquor—a gift from his second son last year.

"Grandpa! Grandma!" Frank screeched the moment he spotted them. "Did you get the money?"

Silence fell over the room.

The scar-faced leader staggered off the kang bed, reeking of alcohol as he loomed over the old man. "Where's the cash, old man?" His calloused hand thrust under the elder's nose.

Without a word, the grandfather yanked Frank up by the collar and dragged him toward the thug like a sack of potatoes.

"No money," the old man's voice cut like ice. "Take him. Do what you want. This is the Ferguson home, not his personal den. Leave now, or I'll report your illegal gambling and loan-sharking to the police. See who walks away then."

The grandmother stood speechless. During their walk home, their second son's words had echoed in the old man's mind.

They'd spoiled this boy rotten.

Their endless indulgence had let Frank grow into this lawless brute.

There was no money to give. This time, the grandfather was determined to teach his worthless grandson a lesson. Selling his wife to pay debts? He never should've bailed him out last time—that two thousand had ballooned to five.

This was their fault.

Not their second son's.

No one was born to be another's slave.

No debts were owed!

The old man had reached his limit.

His declaration stunned everyone. The grandmother froze. Frank gaped. Even the scarred leader blinked in surprise.

"Old man, this is your own flesh and blood!" Scarface jabbed a finger at Frank, suddenly sober.

"My flesh and blood? More like my damn curse!" The grandfather sneered. "Anyone who wants this troublemaker can have him. I'd like to live a few more years!"

Only then did Frank realize his grandfather meant every word.

"Grandpa! Have you lost your mind? I'm Frank! The Ferguson heir! If something happens to me, our family line ends!" he howled, never anticipating this move.

Scarface's grin turned sinister. "Think this is a game, old man?" He waved a hand. "Boys, drag him out. Break one leg today. If the money's not here tomorrow, we take an arm. Let's see how many parts we can harvest from this trash!"

The thugs moved as one, hauling Frank toward the door.
###Chapter 407: The Agony of a Broken Leg

Seeing the situation take a dire turn, the old woman clutched the old man's sleeve desperately.

"Old man! What are you doing? Sean is our only grandson!" She had thought he was just bluffing to scare off the loan sharks.

But now, it was clear he meant every word.

"I said I won't interfere, and I won't! If you're so capable, you handle it!" The old man shook her off and paced the room, hands behind his back. "You've shielded him from every mistake since he was a child, and now look—he's turned into a hopeless gambler!"

The old woman stamped her foot in frustration. "But we can't just let them break his leg!"

"A broken leg is better than getting himself killed someday!" The old man slammed his palm on the table. "Five thousand dollars—if you can come up with it, go ahead!"

The bottle of premium liquor on the table was nearly empty. He gave it a regretful shake—his prized vintage, saved for years.

The old woman gasped, her vision darkening as she collapsed to the floor.

"Woman!" The old man hurriedly lifted her onto the bed, pressing hard on her philtrum to revive her.

Just as she regained consciousness, a bloodcurdling scream tore through the courtyard.

"Ah—!"

The dull thud of a heavy club striking flesh followed.

"Move out! We'll be back for the money tomorrow!" The loan sharks cursed as they left.

The old woman sprang up like a fish leaping from water, her movements sharper than any young person's.

Only then did Sean's parents dare emerge from their room.

In the courtyard, Sean lay unconscious, his right leg twisted at an unnatural angle. A bloodstained wooden club lay beside him.

"My boy!" The old woman threw herself over him, wailing.

Sean's mother's legs gave way, and she crumpled to the ground.

"Stop that crying!" the old man roared, his eyes red. "Where was all this bravery earlier? Go fetch the doctor, now!"

Sean's father wiped his tears. "Dad, his uncle—"

"Shut your mouth!" The old man kicked over a stool. "His uncle isn't his father! If you had any spine, why didn't you pay his debt earlier?"

By the time the village doctor arrived, Sean had regained consciousness. His screams during the bone-setting echoed through half the village.

"If this leg doesn't heal properly, he'll limp for life," the doctor warned before leaving.

Night deepened, and the courtyard was filled with nothing but stifled sobs. The old man squatted on the doorstep, puffing steadily on his pipe.

Moonlight glinted coldly off the bloodstained club.
###Chapter 408: The Nightmare

Frank Harris's nightmare was far from over.

The loan sharks wouldn't relent—not when the five thousand dollars remained unpaid.

The debt collectors returned the next day.

The elder Ferguson shut them out. Frank's parents, unable to scrape together the money, fled the house. His grandmother's tearful pleas fell on deaf ears.

Loan sharks weren't moved by tears.

They dragged Frank out and beat him senseless again.

This time, they broke his other leg.

Through the blinding pain, Frank finally understood—his grandfather had truly abandoned him.

Rage burned in his gut.

"Just wait till I recover..." he seethed silently. "Uncle Jonathan will pay first."

If only his uncle had helped, his grandfather wouldn't have turned so cold.

"And then Grandpa," he thought, teeth clenched.

All that talk about him being the Ferguson family's only grandson meant nothing when it mattered.

Frank blamed everyone but himself.

He hated them all.

But his revenge would never come.

A month later, the loan sharks realized the Fergusons truly had no money.

Even his grandmother had stopped crying.

Furious, the collectors struck back.

On a moonless night, the Ferguson home went up in flames.

The fire raged, swallowing the entire compound in minutes.

Frank, already paralyzed from his spinal injuries, couldn't escape.

The rest of the family survived—but their home didn't.

Only charred ruins remained.

The village took pity, lending them an abandoned hillside cave for shelter.

"With able hands, you can rebuild," the mayor said.

Then Jonathan Ferguson returned.

Frank's father watched his brother with desperate hope—and simmering resentment.

"If only you'd given the money..." he thought bitterly.

His son crippled, his home destroyed—all Jonathan's fault.

His gaze burned with accusation.

But the elder Ferguson surprised them all.

"Son," the old man sighed, "that house was built with your money. Maybe it's for the best it's gone."

Jonathan stood frozen.


###Chapter 409: None of My Damn Business

"Dad, I've already called the police." Jonathan Ferguson helped the elderly couple onto the tricycle. "We can't just let this go after what happened. You should come stay with me in town. Darren and his wife have their hands full taking care of Sean."

Darren Ferguson exploded at this. His shovel clattered to the ground.

"What the hell are you implying?" His entire body trembled with rage. "Sean's in this state, and all you care about is taking Mom and Dad away?"

Jonathan methodically locked the tricycle before turning around, his gaze icy.

"Tell me, brother—did I teach Sean to gamble? Did I force him to take out loans?" He let out a derisive laugh. "Him being bedridden is none of my damn business!"

Darren was left speechless. Since when had his younger brother become so sharp-tongued?

"How much money has Sean taken from me over the years?" Jonathan began counting on his fingers. "Three hundred for his last gambling debt, five hundred before that, and—"

"That's different!" Darren interrupted, his face flushing red. "He's our family's only hope! Who else will take care of you when you're old?"

Jonathan suddenly smiled—a smile that sent chills down Darren's spine.

"Him?" He pointed toward the house where his nephew lay paralyzed. "A gambling addict? Or a cripple?"

"You—!" Darren raised his fist, ready to strike.

Jonathan caught his wrist mid-swing. "Brother, my money goes where I choose. As for my future..." He released Darren's arm and brushed off his sleeve. "I have a daughter."

The tricycle sputtered to life, kicking up dust as it departed. Darren stood rooted in place, struck by how terrifyingly unfamiliar his brother had become.

From inside the house, Sean's agonized wails pierced the air: "Dad! It hurts!" Darren wiped his face and hunched over as he trudged back inside.

Beyond the courtyard wall, nosy neighbors clicked their tongues in disapproval.

"The Ferguson family is falling apart..."
###Chapter 410: Speechless

"Jon, you—"

Walter's words struck a nerve with Darren. His son was now bedridden, unable to even care for himself, let alone support them in their old age. What use was such a "pillar of the family"?

Jonathan Ferguson regarded his parents calmly. "Mom, Dad, I came to take you to town. I know what happened here, but this time, I won't intervene. Last time I tried to help, it only made things worse for Sean. If we'd just stuck to farming those few acres, maybe he wouldn’t be in this state."

He paused, then continued, "Darren can barely manage himself now, and Sean’s condition is what it is. Come with me. There’s nothing left here anyway—the house is gone. My car’s outside."

Eleanor opened her mouth to protest, but Walter silenced her with a look.

"Jon’s right," Walter sighed. "If not for him, we’d never have had that house to begin with. We spoiled Sean rotten. We’ll go with you."

Darren’s heart sank. If his parents left, Jon would never lift a finger for them again.

"Mom! Dad! How can you abandon Sean? You raised him yourselves!" Darren stomped his foot in frustration.

Eleanor wiped her tears, hesitating.

Walter scoffed. "We’re leaving for your sake. If you work the land properly, save up for Sean’s treatment and rebuilding, you’ll manage. But if you’d rather we stay, fine—Jon’s retirement house for us is still standing."

Darren choked on his words. The last thing he needed was two more mouths to feed.

"That’s not what I meant," he stammered. "You should go with Jon. Staying here would just mean more hardship."

Walter snorted and led Eleanor out without another word. Darren stood frozen, watching as his parents climbed into the shiny new sedan.

Dust swirled behind the tires, stinging his eyes. He knew—no one would ever send money to this house again.
###Chapter 411 Turmoil

After Jonathan Ferguson drove his parents back to town, the Ferguson household collapsed into chaos.

Sean Ferguson lay paralyzed in bed, his limbs twisted like a broken ragdoll. The loan sharks had been merciless, shattering his bones beyond repair. Now he could never gamble or cause trouble again.

The police arrested the entire loan shark operation, sentencing them to lengthy prison terms. The Ferguson family drama had finally reached its bitter end.

Darren Ferguson and his wife now lived in misery. With their son bedridden and needing constant care, they had to handle all the farm work themselves. Ironically, their chickens and pigs thrived so well that they saved hundreds by year's end—a cruel twist of fate.

Luna White never knew that by changing Jonathan's destiny, she'd indirectly destroyed Sean. Had she known, she would've cheered. Making Sean suffer a living hell was far more satisfying than killing him outright.

Meanwhile, the Wallace household was in uproar.

Ryan Wallace had secretly left with Luna Whitaker and her three children on the fifth day of the new year, sending old Walter Wallace into a rage. He threatened to disown his son, secretly hoping Ryan would come crawling back after failing in the city.

"With no education or skills, he'll end up begging on the streets!" Walter ranted daily.

The new tiled house he'd built stood empty, waiting for his eldest son's return. Instead, news came that Ryan had opened a restaurant in the city.

The mayor claimed Luna helped them establish the business, and it was thriving. Walter refused to believe it. "Money doesn't grow on trees in the city! Just wait and see!"

He expected the urban migrants to return weeping about unpaid wages. But a year passed without a single complaint. Today, after Clara Clark's visit, his wife Eleanor suddenly demanded to visit their son in the city.

"Have you lost your mind? That ungrateful wretch isn't worth seeing!" Walter slammed the table.

Eleanor wiped her tears. "The mayor says Ryan's a successful businessman now, earning over ten thousand monthly. I miss my grandchildren..."

"Bullshit! They're lying!" Walter's beard quivered with fury. "Go if you want! I'll die before setting foot there!"

To his shock, Eleanor grabbed a bundle and stormed out. "Then I'll go alone! I'm done with this life!"

Walter stood dumbfounded. His meek wife had never defied him like this. Staring at the empty courtyard, panic gripped him.

Could it be true? Had his son actually succeeded?
###Chapter 412: I'm Going Anyway!

"Can't you just let it go? Is he still your son? He's mixed up with that kind of woman, and you still care about him? All he thinks about is her—when was the last time he remembered his own parents?" Walter Wallace slammed the table, furious that his wife had suddenly decided to run off to the city.

Eleanor stomped her foot in frustration. "You can disown him if you want—I won't!"

She rummaged through the drawers, swiftly packing a bundle of clothes. It was clear she had made up her mind.

"Have you lost your mind? Didn’t I tell you? Let Nathaniel suffer out there! Only then will he realize how hard life is and who truly cares for him! Or do you actually want him to spend his life with that divorced woman, raising another man’s child?"

"Enough of your nonsense! The mayor got a call from Nathaniel today." She ignored him, counting the bills she’d tucked away in her handkerchief.

"What did he call for? Couldn’t make it on his own?" A smug grin crept onto Walter’s face. If his son had failed, he’d love to see how that couple would handle it.

"Ha! They’re doing just fine!" Eleanor scoffed. "The mayor said Nathaniel owns two restaurants now and plans to open two more this year! Your little scheme will never work!"

After decades of marriage, she knew exactly what her husband was plotting.

Walter’s face darkened.

"If he’s doing so well, why bother calling?" What infuriated him even more was that their son always contacted the mayor—never his own parents.

"Luna’s pregnant! Our boy’s going to be a father! How can I not go take care of my daughter-in-law and grandchild?" She tightened the knot on her bundle.

"What? She’s pregnant?" Walter felt as if he’d been struck by lightning.

He had clung to the hope that Nathaniel would come to his senses and leave Luna.

But now there was a baby on the way! Once that child was born, how could Nathaniel ever walk away?

This meant he’d lost his son for good!

"Yes, she’s pregnant! This is Nathaniel’s first child—boy or girl, how could I, as their grandmother, not be there? When our other daughters-in-law gave birth, didn’t I take care of them during their confinement? Why shouldn’t I go for Nathaniel?"

Eleanor had long hoped for her son to settle down and start a family. She wasn’t thrilled about him marrying a divorced woman—what mother would be?

But what’s done is done, and now there’s a grandchild. How could she pretend not to know?

If her husband wanted to disown their son, fine—but she wouldn’t!

"You’re not going! If I don’t acknowledge them, neither will you!" Walter roared.

Eleanor planted her hands on her hips and glared. "I’m going anyway! What are you going to do about it?"

The tension between them crackled like gunpowder in the air.
###Chapter 413: The Matriarch Arrives

No matter how fiercely Old Man Wallace and his wife argued, it was useless. At the crack of dawn, Eleanor Wallace ordered her second and third sons to pack their bags—she was determined to go to the city to find her eldest son.

"Mother, you've never even left the county at your age..." Walter Jr. wrung his hands anxiously.

"Enough!" Eleanor thumped her cane on the ground. "If you won't take me, I'll crawl there myself!"

With no choice, Walter Jr. rushed to the mayor's house that night for the address. The mayor puffed on his pipe and sighed. "Ryan Wallace has done well for himself—opened three hotpot restaurants in the provincial capital..."

The train clattered for over ten hours. Eleanor clutched her bundle tightly, her eyes fixed on the blurring landscape outside the window.

"Mother, we're here." Walter Jr. helped her off the train. They stood frozen in the bustling station square, overwhelmed by the endless stream of people.

Following the address through winding streets, they finally spotted the gilded sign of "Old Wallace Spicy Hotpot." The three-story building blazed with lights, a long queue snaking out the door, the rich aroma wafting far and wide.

"This... this is Ryan's place?" Walter Jr. stammered.

Inside, the restaurant buzzed with noise. Luna Whitaker leaned against the counter, pale and nauseous from her two-month pregnancy. Ryan juggled customers while handing his wife a glass of water, his expression tender.

"Welcome!" A server's cheerful voice suddenly pitched higher. "Boss! Your mother's here!"

Ryan's tray clattered to the floor. He turned and saw his travel-worn mother and brother at the entrance. His eyes reddened instantly.

"Mom!" He rushed over in three strides, taking the bundle from her hands. "How did you—"

Eleanor seized her son's arm, scrutinizing him. "You've lost weight." Then she spotted Luna's rounded belly and brightened.

Luna forced down another wave of nausea and stepped forward. "Mother, please sit—" She barely finished before covering her mouth and darting toward the back.

Ryan hurried after her as Eleanor called out, "Careful! My grandson comes first!"

The matriarch squinted at the impressive establishment, then suddenly slapped her knee and laughed. "Wonderful! My boy's really made it!" Her booming voice briefly silenced the entire dining area.

Then the phone at the counter rang. The third son's wails came through the line. "Mom! Dad broke his leg! You need to come back now!"
###Chapter 414: First Meal in the New Home

After seeing off the last customers, Luna rubbed her sore lower back. Ryan thoughtfully took the dishcloth from her hands. "Take a rest, honey."

They led the elderly woman and Erniu to the backyard. Walking through a narrow alley, their eyes widened at the sight—four brand-new six-story buildings stood in neat rows.

"You...you bought these?" Erniu's eyes bulged as his rough fingers nervously twisted the hem of his shirt.

Luna smiled faintly. "Yes, we just moved in a few days ago."

The elevator stopped on the fifth floor, and Ryan took out his keys to unlock the door. Warm air rushed out as soon as they stepped inside, making the old woman shiver. "Goodness, why's it so warm in here?"

"Mom, it's central heating," Ryan explained, helping her settle onto the leather sofa before turning on the TV. When the colorful screen flickered to life, Erniu shot to his feet.

Luna started toward the kitchen, but Ryan gently pulled her back. "Sit down. I'll handle it."

The old woman had already rolled up her sleeves with determination. "No arguing—I'll do it!" She marched into the kitchen but froze in confusion. "Why's the stove so bare? Where's the firewood?"

Ryan chuckled as he followed her in and turned the gas knob. With a click, blue flames leaped up, startling the old woman into jumping back.

"Lord above! City folks don't even use firewood to cook?" She cautiously reached out to test the flame, but Ryan quickly stopped her.

"Mom, that's gas—it's dangerous." He patiently showed her how to adjust the heat. "See, turning it this way lowers the flame..."

In the living room, Luna poured Erniu a cup of hot tea. He held the delicate glass cup awkwardly, looking overwhelmed. "Sis, you're really living the high life now."

Before Luna could respond, a wave of nausea hit her. She covered her mouth and rushed to the bathroom, faint retching sounds drifting out.

The old woman hurried over, patting her daughter-in-law's back sympathetically. "Oh, my poor dear, pregnancy's tough, isn't it? From now on, I'm handling all the cooking!"

Ryan handed Luna a glass of water, his eyes full of concern. She rinsed her mouth and gave a weak smile. "It's fine—just can't stand the smell of oil smoke right now."

"Perfect!" the old woman declared. "From today, this kitchen is my territory—no one else steps in!" She grabbed a spatula and stormed back into the kitchen with fierce determination.

Erniu whispered to Ryan, "Bro, that gas tank won't explode, will it?"

Ryan stifled a laugh. "Don't worry, it's safe." No sooner had he spoken than a loud clang came from the kitchen—the old woman had dropped the cast-iron pan.

The three exchanged glances before bursting into laughter. In their new home, the long-missed warmth of a family meal began to fill the air.
###Chapter 415: The Taste of Home

Luna Whitaker stood at the kitchen doorway, nervously twisting the hem of her blouse. Watching her mother-in-law bustling by the stove, warmth bloomed in her chest.

"Mom, let me help," she said softly.

The elderly woman waved without turning. "Go on, you're thin as a reed. Go rest." Her spatula danced across the sizzling pan, filling the air with savory aromas.

Luna opened her mouth to protest when the older woman suddenly spun around, eyes twinkling. "What would you like? I'll cook whatever you want."

"I..." Luna's eyes grew moist.

"What? Don't like my cooking?" The old woman feigned sternness.

"Of course not!" Luna shook her head hurriedly. "I just don't want you to tire yourself."

The matriarch studied her daughter-in-law. Though slender, the girl had clear, honest eyes. Her foolish husband had no idea what a treasure they'd found in this wife.

At dinner, Ryan Wallace served his brother another slice of meat. "Stay a few more days, Erniu. I'll show you around the city."

The younger brother scratched his head. "It's too big, brother. Mom and I nearly got lost just coming here."

Ryan laughed. "Just ask for directions! Everyone knows our hotpot restaurant now."

The old woman cocked her head. "When did you learn to cook, Ryan? You couldn't even boil noodles properly at home."

Ryan grinned sheepishly. "That's all thanks to Luna. She gave us the hotpot recipe."

Luna smiled quietly beside him. Who would've thought? A year ago they'd been crammed in a tiny rental, and now they owned a home and two delivery vans.

Watching her son's animated face, the old woman felt the weight lift from her heart. Life, it seemed, kept getting sweeter.
###Chapter 416: A Daughter's Blessing

"Goodness, why is this shop called 'The Wallace Family'?" Eleanor Wallace frowned at the sign, her irritation rising. How could her son's business not carry their family name?

Ryan Wallace immediately recognized his mother's displeasure.

"Mom, there's a reason for the name," he said, pouring her a cup of tea. "The secret recipe came from Luna, and she provided the startup funds too. Truthfully, this shop belongs to my sister-in-law. We're just managing it for her."

Eleanor's teacup paused mid-air.

"Profits are split fifty-fifty, with Luna taking the larger share," Ryan explained earnestly. "So what should we call it?"

Heat rose to the older woman's cheeks.

She'd assumed her daughter-in-law was taking advantage of her son, never realizing it was their family benefiting from Luna's generosity.

"Luna..." Eleanor grasped her daughter-in-law's hand. "This old woman was being foolish. Your sister has been so kind to you both—you did the right thing."

Luna's eyes grew moist.

"I came specifically to help with your postpartum care," Eleanor said, patting her hand. "With no family of your own here, what kind of mother-in-law would I be if I didn't step up?"

Ryan interjected, "Mom, I really want a daughter. Our second and third were both boys—how boring is that?"

"Pah!" Eleanor laughed. "If you could have daughters by yourself, what would you need a wife for?" Turning back to Luna, she added, "A granddaughter would be wonderful. This grandma would adore a little girl."

Luna burst into laughter, the weight lifting from her heart.

Sunlight streamed through the window, bathing all three faces in its warm glow.
###Chapter 417: Ryan's Resolve

The morning sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains as Luna caught the savory aroma wafting from the kitchen.

Eleanor had risen before dawn to prepare millet porridge, steamed buns, and two side dishes. After Samuel left for school with his backpack, the elderly woman busied herself cleaning the house and even washed their dirty laundry.

Ryan had been persuaded by Walter to stay. With the new shop under renovation and short on hands, Ryan helped out wherever needed. The work kept him busy until late December. When he finally prepared to leave, Walter pressed two large bags of New Year's provisions into his hands.

On the bus back to the village, Ryan gazed at the scenery flashing past the window, his heart in turmoil.

The pig farm had been hit by disease this year, wiping out dozens of hogs in the blink of an eye. Watching his elder brother thrive in the city left Ryan restless. His sister-in-law now dressed like a city dweller, even speaking with an urban accent.

"What about freight transport?" he'd suddenly asked Walter two nights ago as they smoked by the shop entrance.

Walter's eyes lit up. "Finally coming to your senses!"

Ryan rubbed his hands. "But the startup capital..."

"How much?" Walter cut in. "I'll cover it."

Ryan's eyes grew moist. He knew the old man would reach for the broom if he heard of this plan. His father believed pig farming was the only path, determined to keep all three sons tied to the sty.

But Ryan couldn't accept that.

At home, the old man eyed the provisions with disdain. "City folks love showing off."

That night, Ryan held his wife close and shared his idea. Her eyes sparkled. "Really?"

"I've made up my mind," Ryan whispered. "Come spring, I'll get my license and learn the ropes by riding along first."

His wife nestled closer. "I've wanted to move out for ages. Last time I tried buying our daughter a new dress, I had to endure your mother's glares."

The words stung. His own wife couldn't spend money without permission—what kind of life was that?

"Once we're on our own, buy whatever you like," he kissed her forehead. "I've asked around. Transport's hard work but pays better than pigs."

She looked up suddenly. "What if your father objects?"

"That's not his call!" Ryan's voice turned firm. "I'm not a child anymore."

Outside, the winter stars shone brilliantly. Gazing at their twinkling light, Ryan glimpsed the new life awaiting his family.
###Chapter 418: Trench Rot

Old Man Walter squatted on the threshold, puffing on his pipe. The embers in the bowl flickered intermittently as he stared vacantly toward the village entrance.

"That damn brat didn't even come home for the holidays," he muttered, taking a harsh drag that sent him into a coughing fit.

His wife had followed their eldest son to the city months ago, supposedly to help with the family business. Not a single letter since.

"Business is good? Bullshit!" Walter spat. "Hope they lose every penny and come crawling back."

Raindrops clattered against the roof tiles like mocking laughter at his futile hopes.

......

Luna White stood at the tent entrance, rainwater streaming down the canvas. Her white coat hadn't dried in three days, clinging damply to her skin.

"Dr. White, the patient in Bed Three is spiking a fever again," a nurse called urgently, her trousers splattered with mud.

Luna rubbed her temples. This cursed weather was worsening the infection rates among the wounded.

"Start with alcohol sponging. I'll check on him."

She trudged through the mire toward the medical tent, each step sinking like quicksand. Distant artillery fire rumbled intermittently—the enemy clearly had no intention of giving them respite.

Andrew Smith stood on higher ground, binoculars in hand, rainwater dripping from his helmet. His camouflage uniform was soaked through, plastered against his frame.

"See anything?" Luna approached.

"Waiting for their next move." Andrew lowered the binoculars, his brow furrowed. "Another failed supply run?"

Luna nodded. "We lost another man. Nobody dares make the trip now."

"Damn it!" Andrew slammed his fist against a tree trunk. "At this rate, we'll collapse before the enemy finishes us."

Luna gazed at the fog-shrouded mountain path. Six critical cases, ten walking wounded, and over half the unit suffering from trench rot. Medical supplies had run out days ago.

"If the rain doesn't stop by tomorrow—" Her voice caught.

"We push through regardless," Andrew said decisively. "No more waiting."

Luna remained silent, fingers brushing the silver needles in her pocket. With her supernatural abilities drained, acupuncture was her last resort.

"I'll treat the men," she turned toward camp. "Trench rot won't wait."

The soldiers' tent echoed with groans. Luna took a steadying breath and lifted the flap.

A wave of heat hit her—reeking of sweat and antiseptic. Dozens of men sat or lay in various states of distress.

"Doc's here!" someone shouted.

Instant silence fell. The soldiers scrambled to cover themselves with blankets.

Expressionless, Luna unrolled her needle kit. "Drop the act. Pants off."
###Chapter 419: The Rain Stops

At last, the sky cleared.

In the early morning, Luna White pushed aside the waterproof tarp covering the cave entrance. The damp air carried the earthy scent of soil. The rain had thinned to a fine mist, and the distant mountains loomed faintly through the haze.

"Finally! No more wading through water," Ethan Lewis said, leaning on his crutch as he approached, his face bright with relief.

Luna nodded, her fingers lightly brushing over the silver needles in her medical kit. After treating the last injured soldier the night before, she had sensed a subtle shift in her supernatural ability.

The change left her both exhilarated and uneasy.

Ever since she had saved Andrew Smith, her power seemed revitalized. The bone-chilling cold that once followed each use of her ability had softened into something gentler—like an autumn breeze grazing her skin.

"Dr. White, ready to go?" Andrew's voice came from behind her.

Luna's pulse jumped. Even without turning, she could feel his presence—warm, like sunlight. Whenever he was near, the lingering cold inside her dissipated effortlessly.

"Almost," she murmured, keeping her head down as she adjusted the medical kit, hiding the flush in her cheeks.

Andrew stood behind her, his gaze lingering on the delicate curve of her neck. Since his near-death experience, he had uncovered her secret. Every time she healed someone, he could sense the cold radiating from her.

"We're heading down the mountain tonight," he said casually, stepping closer. His fingers grazed her shoulder. "Be careful on the way."

A shiver ran through her. That warmth—it instantly melted the chill in her veins. She looked up sharply, meeting his knowing gaze.

"You—" she started.

"I know," he murmured, a faint smile playing on his lips. "See you tonight."

Luna watched him walk away, her heart pounding. Who was this man? How had he unraveled her secret so effortlessly?

"Dr. White!" Jack, one of the transport team members, jogged over. "The injured are ready. When do we leave?"

Luna took a steadying breath. "At nightfall."

As darkness settled, sparse starlight dotted the sky. Luna walked in the middle of the group, glancing back occasionally at Andrew, who brought up the rear. Despite carrying the heaviest load, his steps remained sure and steady.

"Careful!" Andrew suddenly lunged forward, catching her wrist.

Only then did Luna notice the hidden mud pit at her feet. His palm was warm and dry, that familiar heat flooding through her again.

"Thanks," she whispered, making no move to pull away.

Andrew chuckled, his thumb brushing lightly over her pulse point. "Don't mention it, my... antidote."

Luna's eyes widened. He knew.

Their figures gradually disappeared into the mountain path under the cover of night. Neither noticed the pair of cold, calculating eyes watching them from the distant thicket.
###Chapter 420: The Canned Meat

The trench smelled of damp earth after the rain, but it was far better than the earlier downpour. Luna White leaned against the muddy wall, watching as darkness swallowed the forested hills. The blurred outlines of trees twisted in the twilight, resembling crouching beasts.

"Eat something." Andrew Smith's voice startled her—she hadn't noticed his approach.

Luna instinctively patted her pocket. "I still have chocolate."

"Who are you fooling?" Andrew chuckled, pulling a half-empty can from his jacket and thrusting it at her. "Take this."

The savory aroma of luncheon meat hit her nostrils. Her stomach growled traitorously. As she accepted the can, her fingertips brushed against his hand—rough, strong, with pronounced knuckles. She couldn't help imagining how those hands would feel against her cheek.

"You haven't eaten either?" She unfolded her pocketknife, clumsily slicing a portion. "Open up."

Andrew arched an eyebrow but obediently took the meat from the blade's tip. His Adam's apple bobbed, though his gaze remained cool and steady.

Luna cut a smaller piece for herself. The salty richness exploded on her tongue, nearly drawing a moan. Damn this canned meat—it tasted better than any Michelin-starred meal.

"After we get back..." she mumbled between chews, "I'm having hotpot, braised pork, spicy chicken..."

Andrew suddenly took the knife from her, deftly dicing the remaining meat. Before she could react, he held the last piece to her lips.

"You—" Luna's eyes widened.

"Eat." His voice was soft. "We move soon."

The can emptied quickly. Luna licked her lips, realization dawning. "You gave me your entire share?"

Andrew didn't answer, just pocketed the empty tin. In the darkness, his sharp profile tensed, jawline rigid.

"Prepare to move out." He stood, his voice regaining its usual steel.

Watching his retreating figure, warmth flooded Luna's chest. This man always gave silently, never seeking credit. She clenched her fists, swearing inwardly—they would survive this. Survive to share that promised hotpot.
###Chapter 421: Through the Dark Night

Andrew's grip tightened around Luna's wrist, freezing her in place. She looked up, her gaze magnetically locked with his.

Her heartbeat thundered in her ears.

Andrew's eyes traced her features before lingering on her slightly parted lips.

"Rest," he murmured, his voice low.

Luna's mind buzzed. Andrew stretched in the cramped trench, his shoulder pressing against hers as they leaned against the muddy wall. His breath warmed her ear.

Though others surrounded them, the world seemed to shrink until only the two of them remained. This secret intimacy sent tingles through her fingertips.

She caught the scent of gunpowder and sweat clinging to him, felt the heat radiating from his chest.

"Don't be afraid." His finger brushed her forehead. "Close your eyes."

Warmth enveloped her.

When Luna opened her eyes again, she found herself curled in Andrew's arms, her fingers clutching his sleeve like a lifeline.

Andrew's eyes snapped open, alert. When their gazes met, the corner of his mouth lifted. That smile burned brighter than anything in the darkness, making her pulse stutter.

"Time to move." He checked his watch.

The squad assembled quickly. The slippery mountain path made stretchers impractical, so the wounded were carried by their comrades.

Andrew hoisted Ethan onto his back with ease. No one knew the severely injured man's wounds had mostly healed.

Luna was placed in the center of the formation. She glanced at the sky, grateful for the absence of scorching sun. Though moonless, her eyes had adjusted to the dark.

The riverbank drew near.

The roar of rapids crashing against rocks grew louder. The three-meter drop gentled to the east, where transport soldiers carved footholds with their knives.

Luna kept her eyes fixed on the blurred silhouette ahead. Even without seeing his face, she knew exactly who it was.


###Chapter 422: Perilous Path Through the Mist

The icy river roared, its spray dampening her lashes. Each step felt like dancing on knife blades, the slick rocks threatening to betray her footing. Her grip on Lily Collins' hand was so tight her nails nearly drew blood.

"Watch out!" Lily yanked her back. She looked down to see a moss-covered boulder where her foot had almost landed.

This couldn't be called a riverbank. Jagged stones jutted like fangs—some razor-sharp, others oil-smooth. The most treacherous were the loose ones that could send you tumbling into the rapids with one wrong step.

The fog rolled in without warning. One moment she could see her companions ten meters ahead; the next, everything vanished in white. She felt Lily's fingers tighten around hers.

"Raincoats on." Andrew Smith's voice cut through the mist, leaving no room for argument.

No sooner had they pulled on their coats than the downpour began. Rainwater funneled through rock crevices, turning their grueling trek into a nightmare. The wounded man on her back groaned, his pain swallowed by the storm's fury.

"We can't go on," Hank Miller wiped his face. "Need shelter."

Andrew snapped off a branch, probing the undergrowth. Every fissure got flashlight scrutiny for venomous snakes before he'd approach. Rain streamed down his collar, yet his expression never flickered.

"Here!"

A cave lay hidden behind vines. The entrance barely accommodated a sideways shuffle, but inside was unexpectedly dry. Hank went first, sweeping his flashlight beam across the space.

"Clear," he reported.

Sixteen bodies packed into the cramped hollow like sardines. A stifled sneeze earned its owner sharp glances. The drumming rain outside masked their presence, but everyone knew danger might be lurking just beyond the veil.

Andrew leaned against the outermost wall, ear cocked toward the entrance. His hand never left the pistol at his hip, knuckles whitening from the strain.

Water dripped from the ceiling onto his shoulder—each drop a bullseye marking its target.
###Chapter 423: Between Life and Death

Rain pelted against the rocks with a relentless staccato rhythm.

Andrew Smith wiped the water from his face, his submachine gun pressed close to his chest. He stood at the entrance of the limestone cave, scanning the rain-drenched forest with sharp vigilance. Hank Miller crouched nearby, maintaining a defensive distance between them.

"Captain, this storm isn’t letting up anytime soon," Hank murmured.

Andrew gave a curt nod. "Stay alert."

Luna White tossed restlessly before sitting up, tightening her raincoat around her. The damp air carried the earthy scent of wet soil. Around her, the team lay sprawled in exhaustion, some already snoring softly.

She crawled toward the entrance, moving as quietly as she could. Just as she peeked outside, a bolt of lightning split the sky.

"Can’t sleep?" Andrew turned to look at her.

Before he could finish, a deafening explosion shattered the night.

Andrew’s pupils contracted—instinct overtaking thought. He lunged at Luna, dragging her back into the tunnel as debris and dirt rained down on them like a deadly hail.

Luna gasped for breath beneath his weight. A second shell struck, shaking the entire mountain.

"Ambush!" Hank’s shout was swallowed by the explosions.

Andrew shielded Luna’s head as jagged rocks scored deep gashes across his back. When the third shell hit, the terrifying sound of splitting stone echoed above them.

"The others—" Luna’s voice trembled.

Andrew pushed himself up with effort. Muddy water cascaded from above, forming a thick slurry that threatened to flood the cave. He wiped his face and realized the entrance was completely sealed by rubble.

"Hank!"

"Captain... I'm here..." Hank’s voice came weakly but clearly from behind a pile of shattered rock.

Andrew’s stomach dropped. He clawed at the debris, fingers digging into the gaps. Muddy water streamed down his arms, but the rocks refused to budge.

"The people inside—" Luna’s face paled.

Andrew slammed his fist against the barricade, but only the rush of water answered him. The rising sludge was already seeping into the cave. He looked up at the collapsed mountainside, but the downpour blurred his vision.

"We have to dig them out—now!" He seized a rock and smashed it against the pile.

Hank staggered over to help. Together, they frantically tore at the rubble until their nails split and bled.

Luna suddenly grabbed Andrew’s wrist. "Listen!"

Faint tapping echoed from deep within the debris.

Andrew pressed his ear to the stone, his pulse roaring. It was Morse code—they were still alive!

"Hold on!" he roared, digging faster.

The rain intensified, the muddy water now lapping at their ankles. Every second was a race against death.
###Chapter 424: Heart-Pounding Terror

Luna White followed closely behind Andrew Smith as they finally reached the mouth of the rocky cave.

The sight before her made her heart lurch.

"Lily! Ethan!" she shouted into the dark opening. A faint, broken response echoed back, igniting a spark of hope in her eyes.

"We have to get them out now," Luna said, her voice tight. "Any longer, and the mud alone will kill them."

Andrew gave a grim nod.

"Hank!" he called out.

The situation was worse than they'd anticipated. Enemy artillery fire had already begun, and scouts could be closing in. They were likely compromised.

Hank Miller stumbled over, his face streaked with blood.

"Captain!"

"Stand guard," Andrew ordered, slinging his rifle off his shoulder. "Dr. White and I will handle the rescue. Sound the alarm at the first sign of trouble."

Hank wiped the blood from his face. "I'll push forward ten meters. In this damned weather, the enemy could be right on top of us before we see them."

"Remember—no shooting unless absolutely necessary," Andrew said in a low voice. "We're outnumbered. Conserve our strength."

Hank understood, crouching low before vanishing into the rain.

Luna was already digging through the rubble barehanded. Jagged stones sliced her palms, blood mixing with the downpour.

Andrew tore a strip from his shirt and handed it to her. "Wrap them."

They worked frantically, but their hearts grew heavier with each passing second. Mud was seeping into the cave—that was the real killer.

"Use this," Andrew said, pulling out a knife.

Luna took it and gestured nearby. "Secure the weapons first."

Andrew quickly gathered fifteen rifles, each wrapped in waterproof cloth with fully loaded magazines.

The rain intensified.

They pried at the rocks, every second a race against time. Strange noises echoed in the distance, but neither dared to look away from their task.

Luna's gloves had long since torn apart, her blood staining the knife's grip. Andrew's movements grew more urgent, his knuckles white from exertion.

Just as they dislodged a large boulder, a weak cough sounded from within the cave.

Their eyes met—hope flickering to life.
###Chapter 425: Ambush in the Rain

The thunder of artillery gradually faded into the curtain of rain.

The deputy commander's hand trembled slightly as he gripped the phone, receiving word that Andrew Smith was personally leading a team down the mountain. His eyes swept over the surveillance screens, which displayed the mountain road now scarred by shellfire.

"Organize reinforcements immediately!" he barked.

But everyone knew the mountain path had turned into a treacherous, muddy trail in this torrential downpour. The nearest backup wouldn’t arrive for at least two hours.

What chilled them more was the question—how had the enemy pinpointed their position so precisely in this storm?

No one noticed the enemy squad advancing silently through a distant ravine, using the rain as cover. They had originally planned to ambush a supply convoy, but the sudden storm had forced a change in tactics.

"The shelling stopped," Hank Miller whispered, rainwater dripping from the brim of his cap. Years of transport experience had made him intimately familiar with these mountains. "I spotted a platoon moving toward the high ground."

Andrew's gaze sharpened. He understood their plan at once—under the cover of night and rain, they were disguising themselves as a supply unit to infiltrate the high ground.

Luna White's hands were bloodied and raw. She had just brushed against Lily Collins' icy fingers, hearing the woman’s faint plea: "Below… oxygen… someone’s unconscious…"

"Go," Luna gritted her teeth, tearing a strip from her sleeve to bandage her wound. "I’ll keep digging."

Andrew silently pressed his sidearm into her palm, his fingers lingering for a brief moment against hers. In that instant, he wasn’t her fiancé—he was a soldier.

"Remember—sight alignment," he murmured, his voice quiet but clear.

Deep in the forest, the enemy advanced swiftly through the rain. Unaware their movements had already been detected.

Andrew and his team vanished into the storm. Luna watched the direction they disappeared, tightening her grip on the gun. The shadow of the rocks swallowed her whole—only her eyes gleamed in the darkness.

The rain fell harder.
###Chapter 426: Life or Death

A gunshot pierced the night.

Andrew Smith gripped Luna White's hand so tightly his knuckles turned white. In the darkness, his eyes burned like a wounded wolf's, torn between duty and desire.

"Stay hidden! Don't come out!" His voice was hoarse, each word ground out between clenched teeth.

Luna knew what he was thinking. The frontline needed him. The wounded needed him. She nodded firmly. "I'll stay concealed."

She pointed to a crevice between nearby rocks. "That's well-hidden. I can keep digging from there without being spotted."

When Andrew released her hand, she felt her heart tear open.

"When we get back..." He hesitated. "We'll get married."

Then he turned and vanished into the night, his silhouette resolute.

Luna scrambled into the rocky fissure. The cold stone pressed against her cheek, its chill seeping into her bones. She drew her pistol and chambered a round.

The cave entrance was only half-excavated. Another mudslide could bury them at any moment. But continuing now would make her a target.

She reached into the opening, her fingers brushing Lily Collins' icy hand.

"Lily!" Luna whispered urgently. "Enemy ambush. We have to stop digging. Tell everyone to hold hands—no matter what, don't let go!"

Her supernatural ability flowed through their connected hands. She could feel her energy draining rapidly.

Gunfire grew closer. Sparks from bullets ricocheting off rocks flashed like fireflies in the dark.

Luna gritted her teeth. Water dripping from the rocks soaked through her clothes, the cold slithering through her veins like venom. But she couldn't let go.

These soldiers had shielded her with their bodies. Now it was her turn.

Lily's fingers twitched. A weak pulse of energy answered Luna's call.

"Hold on..." Luna's voice trembled. "You must...hold on..."

Her energy neared exhaustion. Darkness crept at the edges of her vision. In her fading consciousness, she thought she saw Andrew moving through gunfire.

The gunshots, explosions, shouts...everything faded away.

Only two sensations remained—the faint warmth in her palm, and one unwavering thought: Don't let go...never let go...

Then darkness swallowed her completely.
###Chapter 427: Life-or-Death Ambush

Raindrops pattered against the leaves, creating a soft, fragmented sound.

Andrew Smith's fingers lightly traced the trigger of his submachine gun, the cold metal keeping his senses razor-sharp. He glanced sideways at Hank Miller, who was holding his breath, eyes locked on the path ahead.

"All rounds chambered?" Andrew whispered.

Hank gave a tight nod, gripping his semi-automatic rifle. "Ready."

The two exchanged a knowing look before melting deeper into the underbrush. They had camouflaged themselves with dead branches and fallen leaves, nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage.

In the distance, intermittent voices mingled with the clatter of metal. Andrew narrowed his eyes, straining to pinpoint the direction.

"Getting closer," Hank murmured.

Andrew raised a silent finger to his lips. Both men froze like boulders, their breathing barely audible.

The rain intensified, droplets rolling off leaves and soaking into their clothes. Neither flinched.

Then—movement. Shadows flickered between the trees. Through the downpour, Andrew made out the distinctive uniforms.

"Forty-three," he counted under his breath, relief faint in his tone.

Hank tightened his grip. "Fewer than expected."

Their ambush point was the only viable path to the high ground—a narrow trail flanked by steep cliffs, forcing the enemy to advance single file.

Andrew adjusted his stance, leveling his weapon. Rain dripped from his cap, blurring his vision, but his focus never wavered.

The lead enemy reached the trail's end, now less than ten meters away. The man scanned his surroundings warily but missed the trap mere feet from him.

"Wait," Andrew mouthed to Hank.

One by one, the enemy filed past. Midway through the column, the commander suddenly halted.

"Damn it," Hank muttered.

The commander stepped toward a large rock—and began unbuckling his belt.

Andrew's stomach dropped. Their worst-case scenario was unfolding.
###Chapter 428: Counterattack

The acrid stench of urine hung thick in the air.

Andrew Smith and Hank Miller pressed themselves against the ground, barely daring to breathe. The enemy commander stood less than half a meter above them, the sound of his relieving himself unmistakably clear.

Don't move. Andrew signaled with his eyes.

Hank's muscles were taut, his finger resting on the trigger. One downward glance from the enemy, and their ambush would turn into a full-frontal assault.

The footsteps gradually faded.

They waited another three full minutes before slowly rising from the mud. Andrew wiped the grime from his face and squinted toward the distant enemy forces.

"Now's our chance," Hank murmured.

Over thirty enemy soldiers stood in a loose circle, their backs turned as they gestured and argued. None noticed the threat creeping up behind them.

Andrew raised his rifle, the scope clearly framing the back of an enemy's head.

"Three... two... one—"

Gunfire erupted.

The first volley took down seven or eight men. Before the enemy could react, Hank had already repositioned and opened fire again.

"Reloading!"

Their coordination was seamless. Bullet casings clattered to the ground as gunshots echoed across the hillside.

Thirty seconds later, not a single enemy remained standing on the mountain path.

"Finish them," Andrew said coldly.

They moved methodically, ensuring each enemy received a bullet to the head. Hank kicked aside a corpse, revealing a soldier feigning death beneath.

"Think you can fool me?" Hank put a bullet through his skull.

Andrew checked his watch. "Two minutes, seventeen seconds."

Faster than expected. The counter-ambush had been executed flawlessly—no survivors, no messengers.

"Move out!"

They retreated swiftly to the cave where their squad waited, gear ready, eyes alight with adrenaline.

"Clean work!" Jack Peterson gave a thumbs-up.

Andrew had no time for celebration. "They'll notice the missing patrol soon. We have to move now—"

A sharp whistle pierced the air before he could finish.

Every face froze.

"We're made," Hank spat. "Prepare to break through!"

Andrew tightened his grip on his rifle, gaze sharp as a blade. "Stick to the plan—two teams. Remember: stay alive."

Outside the cave, the sound of approaching footsteps grew louder. This time, the enemy was coming prepared.

The real battle had only just begun.
###Chapter 429: A Handshake Between Life and Death

Luna White felt like she was dying. Her body was cold as ice—no, colder than ice. She wondered if she'd already turned into an ice sculpture.

She couldn't even move a finger. Her entire body was stiff as a corpse.

"Andrew, come back... please..."

She prayed silently. At this moment, she realized she'd gone too far.

To save these people, she'd thrown caution to the wind. Though she knew her supernatural ability would keep her alive, no one had ever experienced being frozen solid like this.

The slow thawing process felt like dying all over again. She knew this pain too well.

If it were bearable, would she have needed energy potions in her past life?

But where was her energy potion now?

Letting go of Lily Collins' hand would stop the freezing—her only way out. But she could still see the mudslide surging inward.

Letting go meant condemning over a dozen people to death.

She couldn't do it.

A dozen lives hung in the balance. She wouldn't—couldn't—release her grip.

Their clasped hands bound their fates together.

Live or die as one.

For her, it might not be literal. But for those trapped inside, it was life or death.

If there really was a higher power, she refused to believe she'd been reborn just to watch innocent people perish.

These teammates were good, loyal people. They didn't deserve to die in this dark, damp cave.

They deserved warm beds. Their families' embrace.

As long as she stood here, she wouldn't let a single teammate fall.

Never letting go.

Andrew Smith and Hank Miller rushed forward.

Andrew spotted Luna and Lily's interlocked hands immediately. He grabbed Luna's wrist—the biting cold made him shudder.

"Damn it!"

He tore off his raincoat, trying to pull her free. But her body was rigid as a wooden doll, refusing to bend.

What kind of determination is this?

"The... others..."

Luna's vision blurred, but she still thought of her teammates.

Andrew tried to cradle her, but her frozen form wouldn't yield. He could only hold her tight, rubbing her arms desperately.

"Hank, dig faster!" Andrew couldn't spare hands to help clear debris—not when Luna's condition was this dire.

Yet he understood exactly what she was doing. If he'd only suspected before, the visions from his near-death experience had hinted at her secret.

Her healing arts were unlike any medicine.

That so-called "vital energy" wasn't so simple. Maybe it drained her life force—her very essence. He couldn't explain it, but he felt it.

This cold wasn't natural. Yet she was freezing colder than ice itself.

He said nothing. He knew they shared something deeper.

A connection he'd seen clearly when death nearly took him.

Perhaps now, he alone could help her.
###Chapter 430: The Antidote

Luna White trembled violently, curled tightly in Andrew Smith's arms. Her face pressed against his chest, though the height difference left her just beneath his chin. Her hands, which had tried to embrace him, now lay stiff and unyielding.

"Don't worry. They'll be fine," Andrew murmured, glancing at Luna's hand still clutching Lily Collins' before reluctantly lying down with her.

What else could he do?

Luna refused to let go.

Quickly unbuttoning his uniform, he tucked her icy fingers beneath his arms. His palms rubbed vigorously over her body, desperate to transfer warmth. Finally, a flicker of heat sparked within her—tiny embers spreading through her veins.

Her furnace had arrived.

Hank Miller stomped his foot in agitation. "Captain Smith, something's wrong with Dr. White!" Even the most oblivious could see she was nearly frozen solid.

"She overexerted herself treating the wounded," Andrew explained, knowing her condition would raise suspicions.

Hank suddenly recalled the mountain rumors—Dr. White possessed miraculous acupuncture skills that could heal the dying. She must have poured every ounce of energy into saving those patients.

His eyes burned, hands moving faster. Those martial arts novels always warned that depleting one's life force was fatal. Dr. White had risked everything to save others.

A faint warmth finally blossomed in Luna's chest.

"Tighter," she managed through chattering teeth.

Andrew's arms instantly constricted around her. When her body pressed against his, the bone-deep cold made him shudder.

God—how could anyone be this cold?

His body heat enveloped her like molten lava, rapidly thawing the ice within. Luna felt submerged in a scalding tide, so blissful she nearly fainted.

At first, only her skin registered the warmth. Then it seeped deeper—into muscle, into marrow. His powerful arms locked around her, shielding her from the lingering chill.

Oh God...

The relief was so profound it brought tears to her eyes.

His warmth melted her limbs until she slumped bonelessly against him. As the cold receded, her rigid muscles relaxed, and drowsiness crept in. Sensing the change, he held her closer.

Nothing—not hot drinks, not thick blankets—could compare to this.

Her frozen stiffness dissolved into shivers.

At least now she could shiver.

"Better?" Andrew felt her muscles soften. Still cold, but no longer ice.

Luna nodded, glancing at her entwined hand with Lily. "Much. Go help Hank—he's too slow alone." Reluctance tugged at her, but lives were at stake.
###Chapter 431: Miracle in Desperation

Andrew loosened his embrace but kept his hands firmly on Luna's shoulders. His piercing gaze locked onto her pale face as his voice trembled slightly, "Are you really okay?"

Fear gripped him.
Fear that she might collapse again the moment he let go.

Luna forced a weak smile and nodded. "Mm."

Andrew turned to join Hank's rescue team. The two men worked in seamless coordination, moving swiftly. But the rubble was too much—each sharp stone they cleared felt like agony.

"Someone's coming!" Hank suddenly hissed.

Tension shot through the group—until familiar shouts reached them.

Reinforcements!

Twenty soldiers swarmed in to help. Half an hour later, the last boulder was hauled away.

Fourteen lives saved. But two comrades would never leave this place.

The air grew suffocatingly heavy.

Lily threw her arms around Luna, tears streaming. "Thank you..." Her voice broke. No one understood better what Luna had done.

Those hands—those miraculous hands—had been everyone's beacon in the darkness.

"Move out!" Andrew commanded.

Time was critical. The enemy could discover them any second.

An hour later, they finally reached the safety of camp.

The moment Luna and Lily stepped into the medical tent, they were surrounded.

"My God! You actually pulled it off!"
"We heard you saved over a dozen critically wounded!"

But at the sight of the women's battered, bloodied state, the crowd fell silent and respectfully dispersed.

Luna collapsed onto a cot without even changing clothes. Lily was unconscious the instant her head hit the pillow.

Exhaustion.
Days and nights of relentless shelling.
Freezing rain.
The metallic stench of blood.
And that desperate, life-or-death rescue.

Finally—finally—they could sleep.
###Chapter 432: The Long Slumber

Luna White slept like the dead, not stirring for a full day and night. Though gifted with supernatural abilities, even she couldn't withstand the exhaustion that had accumulated. Her healing powers were formidable, but they couldn't mend sheer physical depletion. Using her abilities to cure insomnia? That would be a criminal waste.

She wasn't one for such extravagance.

When she finally opened her eyes, morning light streamed through the windows. Andrew Smith sat by her bedside, his gaze burning with worry and anxiety.

"You're awake?" He pulled her into a crushing embrace, his strong arms radiating unspoken concern.

Luna stiffened. This was a shared barracks—with three other soldiers! If anyone saw them like this, the teasing would never end. While she didn't mind Andrew's closeness, gossip was dangerous, especially in a disciplined military environment.

She pushed him away hastily, scanning the room. Oddly, it was empty. Had everyone deliberately made themselves scarce? The thought made her face flush.

"Where—where is everyone?" The words slipped out before she could stop them.

Andrew chuckled at her flustered expression.

"Don't ask," he said, pinching her nose lightly. "You slept for an entire day and night. Scared everyone half to death. Lily Collins was convinced you'd exhausted your vital energy during that last healing and nearly died. The poor girl cried her eyes out, insisting on finding a qigong master to transfer energy to you."

His tone was equal parts exasperated and amused, though he'd been terrified himself. He knew Luna had supernatural abilities, but the limits of her powers were a mystery. He only remembered the warmth in his chest when she'd healed him—how instinctively her energy had responded to his. Maybe he could help her, but to what extent? He had no idea.

"She actually went looking for one?" Luna couldn't help but laugh. "Where on earth would she find a qigong master?"

"Exactly. If I hadn't stopped her, the whole camp would be in chaos." His expression turned serious. "How do you feel now? If anything's wrong, you have to tell me. Even if no one can help with your energy, we have plenty of doctors for physical issues."

He didn't expect her to explain her abilities. But these sudden, prolonged comas were terrifying. Every time she lay unconscious, his heart twisted with fear.

If anything ever happened to Luna... A dark glint flashed in Andrew's eyes. He would make Wei Shufen pay—court-martial be damned.
###Chapter 433: Selfishness

"I'm really fine, just exhausted these past few days." Luna White chuckled, pinching Andrew Smith's tense cheek. "Look at you, frowning so hard you could crush a fly between those brows."

Andrew yanked her into his arms with enough force to make her gasp.

"Still mocking me?" he growled through clenched teeth. "No returns or exchanges once sold, got it?" His fingers dug playfully into her waist. "Out with it—have you set your sights on some other man?"

The sour tang of jealousy radiating from him made Luna burst into laughter.

She buried her face against his chest, her voice muffled. "Who else could I possibly want but you?" Her fingertip traced idle circles over his heart. "Guess I'm stuck with Captain Smith for life."

She meant it. Across two lifetimes, no man—except her brother Ethan—had ever treated her this well.

Andrew tightened his arms, locking her securely against him. The entire base knew where he was; no one would dare interrupt. For once, he allowed himself to forget discipline and regulations.

Yesterday's scene still haunted him—Luna, drenched in the downpour, refusing to let go of her injured comrade's hand. That petite frame had unleashed a strength that left him awestruck.

Before deployment, he'd thought himself noble for that phone call. If he came back broken or dead, he wouldn't burden her. Now he regretted it.

How could he entrust Luna to anyone else?

What if they didn't love her as fiercely? What if they failed to cherish her?

"Luna..." His voice roughened. He suddenly dipped his head, brushing his lips against hers before pulling away abruptly.

Luna froze, then dissolved into giggles. Her usually aloof captain was blushing, his ears burning crimson.

"Stop laughing!" Andrew feigned annoyance, threatening to tickle her.

Luna dodged, still laughing, but a pang of melancholy struck her. In her past life, she'd given her whole heart only to be betrayed. This time, she'd resolved to lock it away—until this man pried open her defenses.

Too late now. She was hopelessly in love. Her body, more honest than reason, pressed closer, craving his warmth.

Andrew's gaze darkened as he noticed her flushed earlobes. A realization struck him—perhaps selfishness in love wasn't so terrible after all.
###Chapter 434: I Am Your Father

"Report! Urgent call for Dr. White!"

The guard's voice was like a bucket of cold water, snapping the two lovebirds out of their sweet moment.

Luna's cheeks burned as she pushed Andrew away. The man's passion was overwhelming—she adored his fiery affection, but this was hardly the time or place.

Andrew grimaced as he straightened his uniform. Damn it. He'd lost his composure on the battlefield.

Luna quickly braided her long hair into two simple plaits—plain but better than leaving it loose. She hurried to take the call.

"This is Luna White."

Her pulse raced. Who would call her at a time like this?

"Luna, it's your father—Sean Shaw."

The words struck like lightning.

"Mr. Shaw, you've mistaken me for someone else. And wartime calls are strictly for emergencies." She clenched her teeth. Of course the Shaw family had the connections to reach a frontline phone.

"I've confirmed it! You're Julia Shaw's daughter—my flesh and blood!" Sean's voice trembled with emotion. "I went to Six Paths Village myself, tracked down the former women's committee head—"

"Enough!" Luna cut him off. "I don't need a father. John and Mary White raised me with all their love. Stay out of my life."

Her grip tightened on the receiver. Sean only wanted her now because of her connections. The Shaws needed her—just like in her past life, when they'd needed a scapegoat.

"Luna, I'm worried about your safety—"

"Worried?" She let out a cold laugh. "Twenty years of silence, and now you play the doting father? Where was this concern when Kevin Shaw was in trouble?"

Dead silence on the line.

Luna's stomach dropped. Damn. I slipped up.

"You... know about Kevin?" Sean's voice turned dangerously low.

"Bad signal. I'm hanging up." She slammed the receiver down, her palms slick with sweat.

She should've realized sooner—Sean's sudden "fatherly concern" was likely just a ploy to investigate Kevin's disappearance. Now she was in real trouble.
###Chapter 435: The Break

"Luna!" Sean Shaw's ragged breathing came through the receiver. "I know you hate me, but I never knew you existed all these years! Your mother deliberately hid you from me—"

Luna's fingers tightened around the phone, her knuckles turning white.

"Does any of this matter now?" Her voice was glacial. "Twenty-plus years of silence, and suddenly you want to play father? Don't you find that ridiculous, Mr. Shaw?"

Sean's voice rose sharply: "I'm already arranging your transfer back to the capital! If you just acknowledge me as your father, I promise—"

"Promise what?" Luna cut him off with a bitter laugh. "To turn me into a pawn for the Shaw family? Or to use me as their stepping stone?"

Papers rustled on the other end—Sean was clearly struggling to contain his anger. "Do you even realize what you're saying? The Shaws can give you everything you've ever—"

"I don't want it." Each word was deliberate. "I'd rather be a 'cannon fodder' on the front lines than a puppet in the Shaw household."

"You—!" A loud slam echoed as Sean struck his desk. "Who do you think you are? Without the Shaws, you're nothing!"

Luna laughed then—a sound that sent an inexplicable chill down Sean's spine.

"I'm Luna White. Andrew Smith's fiancée. A combat medic in the special forces." Her voice was soft but unshakable. "But I am not—and will never be—a daughter of the Shaws."

Dead silence filled the line.

"You'll regret this." Sean finally spoke, his tone venomous. "Without the Shaws' protection, out there on the front—"

Click.

Luna ended the call without hesitation. Beyond the window, the setting sun bathed the training grounds in crimson, the distant shouts of soldiers carrying on the wind.

She took a deep breath and tore the slip of paper bearing the Shaw family's contact information to shreds.

As the fragments scattered in the breeze, an unexpected lightness filled her chest. Here, she had the man she loved. Comrades who fought beside her. A cause worth dying for.

As for the Shaws?

They were nothing more than a fleeting shadow in her life.
###Chapter 436: Father-Daughter Confrontation

"Beep—beep—beep—"

Sean Shaw stared at the disconnected call, his face dark with fury. It had taken him immense effort just to get this call through—three departments' worth of approvals, endless red tape. And yet, that insolent girl had dared to hang up on him.

Thud!

The receiver slammed back into the cradle.

"Ungrateful brat!" Sean gritted his teeth. "Just like her mother—stubborn and impossible!"

He had planned this perfectly. Once he revealed his identity, she should have been groveling with gratitude. He expected obedience—absolute submission. But instead, the little wretch had talked back!

"Fine. If she won’t take the easy way, she’ll learn the hard way." A cold smirk twisted his lips. "Let’s see how long she lasts in the military."

Straightening his uniform collar, he strode out of the office. This was the provincial military headquarters—without his old friend, Deputy Commander Liam Turner, pulling strings, he wouldn’t even have gotten this call through.

"So? Didn’t go well?"

Liam emerged from the next room, teacup in hand, amusement dancing in his eyes. Childhood friends, he knew all about Sean’s messy past.

"Don’t even ask!" Sean punched the wall. "The little bitch claimed she didn’t know me!"

Liam took a leisurely sip. "Can’t blame her. When was the last time you even fed her? Now you pop up out of nowhere playing father—who wouldn’t be disgusted?"

"But she—"

"Save it." Liam cut him off. "I’ve done some digging. Your daughter’s no ordinary recruit. They call her 'Luna the Needle' in the medical unit. Her acupuncture skills have even the top brass at Central Military Hospital drooling. Several directors have been subtly asking me about transferring her."

Sean’s eyes gleamed.

Now that was unexpected.

He stroked his chin, calculating. If Liam was right, the girl might actually be worth reclaiming. With her in the medical system, the opportunities...

"I just want what’s best for her," Sean sighed suddenly. "What father doesn’t wish happiness for his child?"

Liam nearly choked on his tea.

The old fox. Switching masks faster than flipping a page. One moment cursing her as "trash," the next playing doting dad.

"If you really care," Liam said meaningfully, "don’t rush this. Watch how she performs in the service. When the time’s right..."

Sean narrowed his eyes.

His old friend had a point. If force failed, finesse would do. He’d see just how long her defiance lasted.
###Chapter 437: The Transfer Order

Sunlight streamed through the blinds, casting dappled patterns across the office floor.

"Captain Smith!" The commander's booming voice echoed through the room. "Your team has accomplished something remarkable."

Andrew Smith stood at attention before the desk, his military uniform impeccably pressed.

"High Command has decided to award all three of you the First-Class Merit." The commander flipped open a file. "You're being promoted to T-level position, Hank Miller will become squad leader, and Dr. Luna White receives an exceptional promotion to Grade Nine."

"Sir!" Andrew's voice was firm. "We won't let you down."

The commander suddenly closed the file and gave him a meaningful look. "However... there's another transfer order."

Andrew's pulse quickened.

"After next month's rotation, you'll be reassigned to the capital." The commander paused. "This was your father's decision."

Andrew's brow furrowed slightly. "Permission to speak freely, sir. What about Dr. White and the others?"

"Dr. White?" The commander scanned the documents. "She's being transferred to Cloud Province Hospital. That young woman truly has exceptional medical skills..."

"Sir!" Andrew interrupted abruptly. "I request to be transferred to Cloud Province instead."

"What?" The commander's head snapped up. "Have you lost your mind? The capital offers far better opportunities!"

"I want to earn my position through merit." Andrew's gaze remained steady.

The commander narrowed his eyes. "The truth, soldier!"

Andrew swallowed hard. "Luna... is my fiancée."

The commander burst into laughter. "Well played, son! You kept that quiet!"

He stood and slammed his palm on the desk. "Approved!"

A faint smile touched Andrew's lips. "Thank you, sir!"

"But..." The commander lowered his voice. "Your father..."

"I'll handle it." Andrew's expression was resolute.

The commander clapped him on the shoulder. "Very well. Don't disappoint that young woman."

Stepping out of the office, Andrew gazed at the distant mountain range, a tender smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
###Chapter 438: The Deadly Minefield

Andrew Smith couldn't suppress the grin on his face as he stepped out of the commander's office. Who would have thought the marriage application he'd been carrying around would get approved just like that? The document, stained with sweat, watermarks, and even a few dark red blood spots, had made the commander's eyes glisten with emotion.

"You rascal..." The commander shook his head before signing with a flourish. "Go on. We'll get your marriage certificate processed after the troop rotation."

Andrew snapped a crisp salute, his steps noticeably lighter as he turned away. He touched the breast pocket where the application rested, still warm from his body heat.

But his joy shattered the moment they crossed the danger zone.

The route was eerily quiet today. The supply convoy moved without encountering a single obstacle—not even the distant echo of artillery. Sitting in the passenger seat, Andrew's frown deepened with each passing mile.

"Something's wrong," he told the driver. "Step on it."

The bad news arrived as soon as they finished unloading at camp. A returning convoy had hit landmines—three vehicles obliterated instantly.

"Minefield?" Andrew shot to his feet, slamming his palm onto the tactical map with a loud crack.

The reconnaissance team's report was worse. The enemy had secretly littered the mountain pass with dense clusters of mines—four different types, each with varying sensitivity levels, making clearance nearly impossible.

"Captain, Private Liu..." The soldier's voice broke. "He lost his legs."

Andrew's fist crashed onto the table. This was a vicious tactic. With supply lines cut and no way to evacuate casualties, their highland position would soon run out of ammunition and provisions.

"Assemble the engineering platoon!" he barked. "I want a clearance plan before dawn."

Outside the tent, the night was ink-black. Andrew pulled out the marriage application, studying it under the moonlight again and again.

This time, it was truly do or die.
###Chapter 439: The Bloodied Minefield

Andrew Smith stared at the combat map dotted with crimson markers, his brow furrowed into a tight knot.

"Captain, let my demolition team handle this!" Sergeant Hank Miller snapped to attention, his voice hoarse. "We'll get the job done."

Andrew's fist slammed onto the table. "This isn't about playing hero!" He knew the lethality of this border minefield all too well. These weren't Hollywood props triggered by rolling stones—they were indiscriminate killers.

Fresh intel confirmed the enemy had deployed new composite mines. Stepping on one wouldn't trigger immediate detonation. They'd wait until an entire squad was trapped inside before initiating chain explosions—a calculated massacre.

"Hank!" Andrew barked.

Transport officer Hank Miller jogged in, his camouflage uniform still caked with mud.

"Double the supplies to every outpost. Full retreat before dawn," Andrew ordered, checking his wristwatch.

As Hank rushed out, five transport teams vanished into the night, each soldier carrying over 50 kilograms.

Sergeant Miller persisted. "Captain, at least let us—"

"Enough!" Andrew stood abruptly, the table shuddering. "I want zero casualties!" His words were drowned by distant thunder—an explosion.

Sirens wailed across the camp.

Andrew grabbed his submachine gun and charged outside. Three bloodied figures staggered through the darkness, supporting each other.

"Where's Hank?" Andrew's voice cracked.

The lead demolition soldier's face was a mask of blood, his lips trembling soundlessly.

Andrew led medics into the minefield. Moonlight revealed Hank's upper torso frozen in crawling position, his lower body obliterated. Behind him, a safety corridor marked by small red flags traced where he'd dragged himself through the inferno.

"Cap...tain..." A whisper rose from the gore. The last surviving team member clutched a mine detector, his torso shredded below the ribs.

Andrew's vision blurred. Another artillery barrage lit the night sky in the distance.
###Chapter 440: Blood Oath

"We have to save him!" Andrew Smith's eyes burned with fury, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles cracked. Watching his comrade fall before him, a fire raged in his chest.

His guard yanked his arm back. "Captain, the entire area ahead is mined!"

Every member of the squad had tears in their eyes. This was their brother—the man they'd lived and fought alongside.

Deputy Captain Harold Martin stepped forward. "I'll lead the team. You stay and command, Captain." His voice trembled. "We'll bring Ethan back... alive."

"Don't... come..." Ethan lay in a pool of blood, his legs gone. Yet he smiled—a crimson-stained blossom on his lips.

"Hold on!" Andrew roared.

Every man tightened their fists, hearts shredding at the sight.

Ethan shook his head weakly. "War... takes lives..." Blood bubbled from his mouth with each word. "Don't... waste more... for me..."

A violent cough wracked his body, blood spraying. "Tell my parents... their son... didn't disgrace our name..."

Before anyone could react, he shoved against the ground with shattered arms, his mangled body rolling forward—

"Ethan!" The squad screamed.

They all knew his intent.

This unbreakable warrior was clearing a path with his flesh and blood.

BOOM—BOOM—

Twin explosions rocked the valley. Where Ethan had been, only a smoldering crater remained, painted scarlet.

"Damn them!" Andrew slammed his fist into a tree, skin splitting. This was his soldier—marching knowingly to death.

Back at camp, smoldering rage filled every heart. The stack of volunteer requests from the vanguard teams covered the table.

"Report! Third Squad requests point position!"
"Report! Fifth Squad volunteers as a unit!"

Three days passed. Four vanguard teams charged forth. Over half were lost. Six men stayed forever in the minefield. Four squad leaders died heroes.

The lifeline remained unbroken.

Worse—the enemy seized the moment, raining artillery. Their brothers on the high ground were holding with blood and bone.

"Ammo lasts four days max," the Chief of Staff said grimly.

Andrew stared at the battle map, eyes bloodshot. Suddenly, he stood—

"I'm leading the next charge myself."
###Chapter 441: Bloodstained Path

The darkness before dawn was the hardest to endure. Andrew Smith gripped the battle map until his knuckles turned white. The ultimatum from command hung over him like a blade—forty-eight hours to reopen the supply line.

"Captain, Third Platoon requests another charge," the adjutant rasped.

Andrew snapped the map shut. Three days. The entire engineering company had been nearly wiped out. Young faces that had smiled at him yesterday now lay forever in the minefield.

"Let them rest," he said hoarsely. "We move at first light."

By sunrise, Andrew was fully armed. He led the charge himself, followed by the last ten surviving engineers. Everyone knew this might be their final stand.

At the edge of the minefield, craters gaped like bloody maws. The soil still soaked with the blood of previous waves.

Boom—

An enemy shell landed lazily a hundred meters away, mocking their futility.

"Advance!"

Clad in bulky bomb suits, the engineers waddled like clumsy penguins. The beep-beep of metal detectors counted down their borrowed time.

Three men fell simultaneously.

"Take cover!" Andrew's pupils constricted.

In the explosion's glare, he saw a soldier writhing in a pool of blood. The boy was only nineteen—just yesterday, he'd shyly asked if his sweetheart back home would wait for him.

"Cover me!"

Andrew tore off his helmet and charged. Shrapnel grazed his cheek, the heat searing his skin. He couldn't watch another kid die in front of him.

"Captain! Fall back!" The adjutant's shout drowned in artillery.

When Andrew reached the wounded, his hands sank into slick mud—blood. Three men's blood mingled, indistinguishable.

"Hold on..." He gritted his teeth, hauling up the nearest casualty when his boot clicked against something metallic.

Time froze.

(Cliffhanger)
###Chapter 442: A Marksman's Epiphany

Luna White's hands trembled slightly as she steadied the rifle. The target paper remained pristine, not a single bullet hole in sight. With a frustrated sigh, she lowered the weapon, Lily Collins' mocking words echoing in her ears: "Dr. White can thread a needle blindfolded, but her marksmanship... must've been taught by an evil stepmother."

The jab had spread like wildfire through the medical corps.

"Dr. White, maybe... take a break?" A passing soldier hesitated, pity written across his face.

Luna shook her head stubbornly. Ever since the cave incident, she'd vowed to master firearms. But reality proved cruel—five straight days without even grazing the target's edge.

"I refuse to believe this!" She gritted her teeth and raised the rifle again.

As her finger squeezed the trigger, she instinctively channeled her healing ability. A faint blue glow traveled from her fingertips into the weapon, the barrel growing warm.

Click—

The trigger pulled, but the bullet jammed in the chamber.

"Huh?" Luna blinked. She tried again, only to hear another sharp click of malfunction.

"Dr. White, let me check your rifle." The armory technician hurried over, brow furrowed. "Consecutive jams aren't normal."

Luna handed it over guiltily. What had she just done? "Heal" a gun? The thought was absurd!

The technician expertly disassembled the weapon, then froze. "Strange... the barrel's overheated, but the mechanism's intact." He looked up, confused. "Did you—"

"Nothing! I did nothing!" Luna cut in, ears burning.

Just then, the barrel emitted a faint blue pulse. The technician nearly dropped the rifle. "What the—"

Luna's heart pounded. Exposed! As she scrambled for an explanation, the rifle suddenly vibrated violently.

"Look out!" She lunged forward instinctively.

A brilliant blue streak shot from the barrel. The bullet traced an impossible arc before striking dead center of the 50-meter target.

"Bullseye!" The spotter's disbelieving shout rang out.

The entire firing range fell silent. Every eye locked onto Luna—the "hopeless shooter" who'd missed for five days straight had just nailed a perfect shot?

Luna stood dumbfounded. Staring at the still-warm rifle in her hands, a wild realization dawned: Could my healing ability... modify firearms?

"Dr. White, how did you—" the technician stammered.

Luna forced a calm smile. "Maybe the gun... finally understood me?"

Her fingers tightened around the rifle, heart racing like a runaway train. This accidental discovery might just rewrite her marksmanship destiny...
###Chapter 443: A New Discovery

"Dr. White, would you like to take a break?" A young team member cautiously handed her a towel, his eyes filled with concern. He had just inspected the gun—the firing pin was broken. It shouldn't have been able to fire at all.

Luna took the towel and wiped the sweat from her forehead. Her gaze remained fixed on the weapon, her mind in turmoil. In that split second earlier, she had distinctly felt her supernatural ability reverse its flow, like an electric current suddenly switching direction.

"Give me the gun," she said abruptly, reaching out.

The young man hesitated. "But it's—"

"I know," Luna cut him off, her expression resolute. "I just want to try again."

The moment the gun touched her palm, she closed her eyes. Her ability rippled through her like water, but this time, she deliberately controlled its direction. Warm energy enveloped the cold metal, allowing her to sense the condition of every internal component.

She opened her eyes, raised the gun, and took aim.

Bang!

A perfect bullseye.

Silence fell over the room. Everyone stared in disbelief, including the young man who had sworn the gun was broken.

"That's impossible..." he muttered, snatching the weapon back to inspect it. The firing pin was still snapped, the magazine empty. He looked up, bewildered. "Dr. White, how did you—?"

Luna didn’t answer, only smiled mysteriously. She took the gun again and reversed her energy flow, letting it course backward this time. The metal grew warm in her grip.

She pulled the trigger.

Click.

Nothing.

"Again," she murmured, letting her ability flow normally once more. The gun fired—another perfect shot.

Gasps and scattered applause erupted from the onlookers. Some looked as if they'd seen a ghost.

The young man’s face paled, his hands trembling. He checked the gun a third time, but the result was the same—it was still a useless hunk of metal.

"Dr. White," he swallowed hard, "are you... using some kind of magic?"

Luna handed the gun back without answering. As she turned away, excitement flickered in her eyes. This accidental discovery was monumental—her ability wasn’t just for healing. It could also destroy.

More importantly, she might have found a way to control it.

The young man, refusing to believe what he’d seen, raised the gun and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. This defied every law of physics he knew.

"What the hell..." he whispered, watching Luna’s retreating figure with newfound awe.

Meanwhile, Luna was already striding toward her quarters. She needed solitude to study this revelation. If her hunch was right, it would completely reshape her understanding of her own power.

Maybe she was never just a healer after all.
###Chapter 444 Life and Death on the Line

"Dr. White! The gun... it's jammed!" The young soldier was drenched in sweat, his fingers trembling.

Luna White was packing her medical kit, preparing to return to the medical unit. The past two days had been relentless with the influx of wounded, leaving her no time to rest. Without looking up, she replied casually, "Then fix it. It's not like I broke it."

Her tone was as light as if she were discussing the weather.

The soldier gaped. But you're the one who dropped it carelessly just now!

Before he could protest, hurried footsteps approached.

"Dr. White! Emergency!" Xiao Hu burst in, panting, his face deathly pale.

Luna's heart clenched. "What happened to Captain Smith?"

"He... he charged into the minefield!" Xiao Hu's voice shook. "Said he had to rescue the wounded. We couldn't stop him!"

The roll of gauze slipped from Luna's fingers and hit the ground. A minefield? Even the engineers avoided that death trap!

Without another thought, she grabbed her emergency kit and sprinted outside. Xiao Hu revved the motorcycle, speeding toward the scene with her clinging to the back.

From a distance, she spotted Andrew Smith's figure moving cautiously along the minefield's edge. He had already pulled one wounded soldier to safety and was now heading back in.

"Stop!" Luna screamed, her voice cracking.

But Andrew didn't even glance her way. Step by painstaking step, he inched closer to the two remaining casualties.

Ten meters... eight... five...

Then, his body froze.

Silence fell over the field.

"Oh no..." Xiao Hu turned ashen. "The Captain stepped on a mine."

Luna's vision swam. She knew exactly what this meant—one wrong move, and everything within several meters would be obliterated.

"Let me through!" She lunged forward.

"No!" Xiao Hu yanked her back. "You'll only make it worse!"

Luna stomped in frustration. Her supernatural ability could heal injuries, but it couldn't bring back the dead!

In the center of the minefield, Andrew stood perfectly still on one foot, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. He knew his situation better than anyone—the slightest shift in weight could be his last.

To make matters worse, the two wounded soldiers lay just ahead, one already unconscious.

"Captain!" The soldiers at the perimeter had tears in their eyes. Some began unbuckling their gear, ready to risk their lives to reach him.

"Stand down!" Andrew barked, his voice cutting through the tension like a blade. "That's an order!"

His command left no room for argument.

Luna bit her lip hard enough to taste blood. You fool! The engineers could've handled this—why play the hero?

Then, she noticed Andrew slowly raising his hand, flashing her their secret signal: Trust me.

Tears spilled down her cheeks. Trust him? Right now, all she wanted was to drag that reckless man out and throttle him!

But for now, she could only watch helplessly as he faced death alone.

Time crawled. Each second stretched into eternity.

Then—Andrew moved!
###Chapter 445: The Death Zone

"Andrew!" Luna's scream pierced the sky, plunging the minefield into eerie silence.

Every breath around them seemed to freeze.

This area was littered with the most dangerous fragmentation mines—one wrong move could trigger a chain reaction of explosions.

The engineers swiftly geared up, preparing for the rescue mission.

Andrew turned to see Luna, the corners of his lips lifting slightly. Seeing her one last time was more fortune than he deserved.

A bitter relief washed over him—at least their marriage license hadn't been processed yet. If he died today, she wouldn't be burdened with the label of a widow.

"Luna, I'm fine. Don't worry." His voice trembled despite his forced calm.

He knew her too well. Beneath that composed exterior was a stubbornness stronger than steel. Once she set her mind on something, nothing could change it.

"Tiger!" Andrew barked. "Keep Dr. White safe!"

"Yes, sir!" Tiger's eyes reddened as he grabbed Luna's arm.

She shook him off coldly. "Let go. I won't interfere."

Her unnatural composure made Tiger uneasy. How could she remain so detached when their captain's life hung by a thread?

The engineers inched forward along the footprints, finally reaching Andrew's position.

In the distance, wounded soldiers clenched their teeth, afraid even their breathing might disrupt the delicate operation.

...

Thirty minutes later, the lead engineer looked up, his face ashen.

"It's a new fragmentation model..." His voice shook. "Impossible to disarm."

This type of mine would obliterate everything within sixty meters upon detonation, setting off a catastrophic chain reaction.

Andrew nodded calmly. The engineer's expression had already told him everything.

"Fall back."

He'd long prepared for this moment. Now, his only duty was to minimize casualties.
###Chapter 446: Life and Death

"Captain!" The engineer's voice cracked with emotion.

Tears blurred his vision as they welled up in his eyes.

"Shut the hell up!" Andrew Smith barked. "Wipe those tears and fall back—now!" He wanted nothing more than to kick some sense into the kid, but he didn’t dare move an inch.

His legs had long gone numb, but he knew the slightest shift would turn this place into hell on earth.

To make matters worse, two wounded soldiers lay just a few feet away.

The first casualty had survived purely by luck—he’d collapsed in a cleared safe zone. But now, their luck had clearly run out.

Between him and the wounded, a mere two-meter stretch could be riddled with death traps.

Better he take the risk than send the engineer into that nightmare.

His gaze swept the area.

After three days of carving a path through this minefield with their lives, only five meters remained. Beyond that lay the safety of a stone bridge—impossible to be rigged.

The wounded lay at the heart of the minefield while he stood at its edge.

Perhaps today, their three lives would be the price for clearing this final stretch.

The chastened engineer trembled as he wiped his face and turned away.

Luna White grabbed his arm. "What’s happening? Why aren’t you clearing the mines? That’s your commanding officer!" She bit back her fury—none of this was the young soldier’s fault.

"Can’t be done..." His voice was raw. "A single mine, maybe. But this? It’s a fragmentation cluster... I... I—" He ripped off his helmet and collapsed into sobs.

Muffled weeping spread through the ranks.

Everyone knew the horror of fragmentation mines—lessons written in blood.

What their captain had stepped on was a death sentence.

The men’s tears fell freely. Soldiers weren’t supposed to cry, but this pain cut deeper than facing their own mortality—watching their beloved leader sacrifice himself for his men.

Slowly, Andrew pulled out a crumpled cigarette.

Love my country.

Probably his last one. His hands shook as he lit it, drawing deeply.

His eyes lingered on Luna, then each of his comrades.

Goodbye, my brothers.

However much it hurt, death gave no one a choice. Life’s cruelty lay in never knowing whether the next second brought hope or despair.

In the curling smoke, his face faded from view.
###Chapter 447: A Vow Beyond Life and Death

"Forget me, Luna." Andrew Smith's voice was low and restrained, each word seeming to force its way through clenched teeth. His fists were clenched so tightly that his nails dug into his palms, yet he felt no pain.

The air around them seemed to freeze. The squad members' eyes were red-rimmed, some turning away, unable to bear the sight. The helplessness of watching a comrade march toward certain death was more suffocating than any hail of bullets.

"Andrew!" Luna suddenly shouted, her voice carrying a resolve none had heard before. "Do you think this is noble? Leaving me to live in memories, crying over your photo every day?"

Tears streamed down her face like broken pearls, but she stubbornly tilted her chin up, refusing to let them fall. For the first time since her reincarnation, she felt such fury—at fate, at this absurd twist of events, and most of all, at the self-righteous man before her.

"Do you know how I lived like a ghost in my past life?" Her voice trembled. "And now, after finally finding you in this one, you want me to relive that nightmare?"

Andrew froze. He had never seen Luna like this—her eyes bloodshot but blazing like fire.

Before anyone could react, Luna bolted forward.

"Dr. White! It's dangerous!" someone cried out.

But she paid no heed, her slender figure sprinting through the mud, each step landing precisely on the safe path marked by the engineers. The wind whipped her hair like a dark banner.

Andrew's heart nearly stopped. Instinctively, he opened his arms and caught the woman who threw herself into his embrace.

"You're insane!" His voice was hoarse, but his arms tightened around her of their own accord.

Luna looked up at him, a tear still clinging to the tip of her nose, yet she wore a radiant smile. "Andrew Smith, I want to marry you."

The words struck like thunder. The squad members gaped, some even forgetting to wipe their tears.

"Right here. Right now." Her voice was soft but impossibly firm. "No wedding dress, no ring. Just you—that’s enough."

Andrew's throat worked. He looked down at the woman in his arms, her lashes still wet but her lips curved in a smile. In that moment, orders and duty were forgotten.

"Alright," he heard himself say, his voice rough. "Luna White, will you marry me?"

She rose onto her toes and pressed a featherlight kiss to his lips. It was brief, yet carried the weight of the world.

In the distance, explosions rumbled faintly, but no one paid them any mind. On this battlefield between life and death, two hearts beat as one.
###Chapter 448: Bloodstained Vows

Amid the smoke-filled battlefield, two lovers clung to each other.

Andrew Smith's grip was iron-tight, his nails digging into his palms. He wanted to slap himself—how could he have doubted Luna White's love for their captain? Now, standing there in her bloodied medical uniform, she looked more radiant than any bride.

"I do," Luna's voice cut through the gunfire, clear and unwavering.

Andrew trembled as he slid a makeshift ring—crafted from a bullet casing—onto her finger. No wedding dress, no flowers, only the ever-present shadow of death. Yet it was the most sacred union the world had ever witnessed.

"Salute!" Andrew suddenly roared.

Every soldier snapped to attention, raising their right hands in unison. Tears carved muddy trails down their dust-streaked faces. On the enemy's frontlines, a commander peered through his binoculars, his own eyes burning.

"Sir, should we open fire?" his adjutant whispered.

The commander shook his head. He thought of his wife waiting back home. Love like this didn’t deserve to be shattered by artillery.

Luna stiffened. Her fingers brushed against Andrew’s back—warm, wet. Blood. Shrapnel had embedded itself deep, yet he was still issuing final orders to their unit.

"...Leave the wounded. I’ll clear the path..." His voice grew faint.

Luna seized his wrist. She’d almost forgotten her greatest secret—the hands that could cheat death itself.

"You won’t die. Not while I’m here," she whispered against his ear, her palms glowing faintly.

On the enemy’s side, the commander lowered his binoculars. "Cease fire for two hours," he ordered.

"But sir—"

"That’s an order!" His gaze lingered on the embracing couple. "Let love...live a little longer."

Luna’s supernatural ability surged violently. Andrew’s wounds knit together before their eyes—but her face paled with each passing second. This healing came at a cost: her own life force.

"Luna?" Andrew gasped at the warmth flooding his veins.

Her smile was weak. "This time...it’s my turn to protect you."

The distant roar of engines shattered the moment. Headlights pierced the smoke, illuminating the newlyweds—their faces smeared with blood and grime, yet alight with joy.

(Foreshadowing: Luna’s life-threatening energy depletion; the enemy commander’s humanity hinting at future alliances; the arriving convoy signaling hope.)
###Chapter 449: The Silent Minefield

"All units, attention!" Andrew Smith's voice crackled through the radio.

Every muscle tensed instantly. They knew their commander too well—this was his suicide-run tone.

The two wounded soldiers exchanged glances, resolve flashing in their eyes. They understood the unspoken message behind Andrew's earlier words.

At their current position, retreat wasn't an option.

The commander planning to clear a five-meter path alone? Impossible.

Which meant when the mines detonated, they'd have to buy their comrades two more meters with their own bodies.

They raised thumbs in silent farewell.

Luna White's fingers trembled. A wild idea struck her—a new application for her supernatural ability.

If it worked on rifles... could it work on landmines?

Just disable them long enough...

"Andrew!" She grabbed his sleeve, whispering urgently, "Trust me. I can neutralize the mines."

His pupils contracted.

"Odds?" No questions. Just absolute trust in this extraordinary woman.

"Fifty-fifty." She bit her lip. "Better than certain death."

"Done." His response was steel. Turning to the team, he barked, "Hold position! That's an order!"

Then, to everyone's horror, the pair stepped forward—

Straight into the kill zone.

"No—!" Someone screamed.

Time froze.

One second. Two. Three.

No explosion.

"A... dud?" someone stammered.

Cheers erupted. Miraculous luck!

Only Andrew knew the truth. His gaze locked with Luna's as she gave him a conspiratorial wink.

"Engineers!" He snapped into action. "Pass the detector. Dr. White and I will clear the path."

"But Commander—"

"Now!"

Andrew had to lead this charade. Only his "bomb disposal expert" cover could explain their survival without exposing Luna's secret.

Luna exhaled shakily, her fingertips still tingling with residual energy.

Round one of this deadly gamble went to them.
###Chapter 450: A Blessing Forged in Life and Death

Andrew Smith gripped the metal detector tightly, his other hand interlaced with Luna White's fingers. No one knew that only through this physical connection could Luna help him detect landmines.

He moved with more caution than ever before. At this moment, his will to survive burned brighter than ever—especially when the woman he loved was risking her life to assist him.

Each step was measured and deliberate.

Beep— The detector sounded its alarm.

Another landmine discovered. Andrew expertly excavated it, prompting cheers from the surrounding soldiers.

The second, the third... One after another, the explosives were neutralized.

At first, the team celebrated each success, but soon their reactions shifted to stunned silence.

Their captain seemed divinely guided today, clearing mines with uncanny precision. The soldiers exchanged glances—was Dr. White's presence the reason?

"Should've let them marry sooner," someone muttered under their breath.

Mine clearance wasn't typically the captain's duty. Yet today, Andrew achieved the impossible—thirty landmines disarmed in three hours without a single detonation.

Even more astonishing, the enemy's artillery remained eerily quiet throughout the operation.

"Today's truly blessed!" someone exclaimed.

When the final explosive was cleared, the path stood open. Only then did enemy shells finally roar—but they landed wildly off target.

"Sounds more like celebratory gunfire for the captain," a soldier joked.

Andrew led Luna back to camp, where news of their success had already spread. The entire battalion stood in formation to welcome them.

Lily Collins gathered wildflowers, pinning one blossom to Andrew's uniform and another to Luna's collar before pressing a fragrant bouquet into the doctor's hands.

"May Captain Smith and Dr. White share a century of happiness—and many children!"

Amid the cheers, Luna's cheeks flushed pink. The fearless physician who'd strode through minefields now blushed like a bashful girl.

Andrew tightened his grip on her hand. As their eyes met amidst the crowd's jubilant well-wishes, their shared smile spoke volumes beyond words.
###Chapter 451: Marriage Report

One month later.

The smoke of battle had finally cleared from the highlands. Andrew Smith completed the troop rotation and was officially transferred to the Cloud Province Military District. Luna White followed him, assigned to work at the district hospital.

As the train slowly pulled away, the scenery outside the window blurred. The land that held their shared memories of life and death gradually faded into the past.

"What? He's not coming back?" General An Cheng slammed his hand on the desk, sending tea splashing across its surface.

His secretary nervously handed him the documents. "Sir, Captain Smith has voluntarily requested to remain with the local forces..."

An Cheng's fingers trembled slightly. He had assumed his son, after such distinguished service, would naturally return to the capital. He knew better than anyone the weight of that First-Class Merit—two men holding off forty enemies was nothing short of miraculous. Not to mention the legendary feat of clearing minefields alone, a story now celebrated throughout the military.

And then there was that battlefield wedding...

"Fine." An Cheng suddenly deflated. "If he wants to gain experience in the field, so be it."

His son had truly grown up.

Cloud Province Military District

"Reporting for duty, sir!" Andrew and Luna saluted in unison.

The senior officer smiled warmly at the striking couple. "Well done, son. Finally got you two stationed together." He had deliberately arranged for them to serve at the same base.

After completing their paperwork, they were granted a month of leave.

"Come on." Andrew grabbed Luna's hand.

"Where are we going?"

"The civil registry."

Three hours later, Luna stared at the crimson marriage certificate in her hands, still dazed. Just like that... they were married?

"Stop spacing out. Pack your things." Andrew ruffled her hair. "We leave for the capital tomorrow."

Luna looked up sharply. "So soon?"

"Time to meet the in-laws," Andrew said with a grin. "Besides, the General specifically requested to see the 'battlefield lovebirds.'"

On the train, Luna watched the landscape rush by, her fingers twisting unconsciously in her lap.

"Nervous?" Andrew took her hand.

Luna bit her lip. How could she not be? The woman who had stolen her chance at university—Wei Shufen—was about to become her mother-in-law.

The thought of calling that woman "Mom" turned her stomach.

And then there was the gnawing fear—would her dream of attending university even be possible at the new hospital?

The rhythmic clatter of wheels against tracks pounded like a drumbeat against her heart.
###Chapter 452: Destiny's Design

"Don't worry. I'm here." Andrew Smith's slender fingers deftly peeled an apple, his lips curved in a gentle smile. As fellow military personnel, they'd naturally secured lower berth tickets for the overnight train.

Luna White gazed at the blurring landscape outside the window, her heart unsettled. Though now rightfully Andrew's wife, the thought of meeting his family still tightened her chest. She resolved that after their Capital wedding, she'd insist Andrew visit her hometown properly as the White family's new son-in-law to meet her siblings.

"That stepmother of yours must despise me," Luna pursed her lips. "She's probably filled your father's ears with poison about me by now."

It wasn't fear—just distaste for forced pleasantries. Rather than endure hollow social rituals, she'd rather reunite with her own kin. Part of her even fantasized about holding the wedding in her hometown instead, surrounded by genuine warmth.

Andrew handed her the peeled apple, affection glowing in his eyes. "Every bride must face her in-laws eventually. Besides," his voice dropped to a conspiratorial murmur, "we're legally married now. What can they possibly do?" His tone shifted unexpectedly solemn. "I've chosen you for life. To grow old together, hand in hand."

Luna burst into laughter at his sudden romanticism, eyes crinkling like a cat who'd stolen cream. "Silver-tongued devil!"

The compartment lights flickered, casting dramatic shadows across Andrew's chiseled profile. In that moment, Luna knew—this man was her lifelong harbor.

As Andrew gathered fruit peels, his confidence far surpassed Luna's. Their marriage license's smooth processing could only mean his father's tacit approval. Otherwise, with Nathaniel Smith's temperament, any bureaucratic pretext could've delayed them for months.

The irony of fate struck him. What he'd anticipated as explosive confrontation had dissolved through this impromptu wedding. Perhaps some designs were truly celestial.

"Rest now. I'll wake you when we arrive." Andrew drew Luna against his shoulder as the train raced through the night, carrying the newlyweds toward their unwritten future.
###Chapter 453: The Shaw Family Mystery

"Luna, I've found information about the Shaw family," Andrew whispered, his warm breath brushing against her ear.

Luna's fingers trembled slightly.

"Are they... doing alright?"

She had never resented the woman who had given her life at the cost of her own. Her sister had told her that Julia Shaw had chosen to save the baby without hesitation on the delivery bed. That selfless maternal love had left Luna with an inexplicable longing for the Shaw family, whom she had never met.

"After the Shaw family was rehabilitated, the eldest son, Sean Shaw, was transferred to the capital. The second son, Simon Shaw, remained in the healthcare system of Cloud City," Andrew said, flipping through the investigation documents. "The elderly couple lives with their eldest son and never returned to the capital."

Luna clenched the hem of her shirt. The whole family was reunited, but no one had ever searched for the daughter who had passed away so young?

"It seems... they're doing well," she said, her voice tight. All these years, had no one ever wanted to find out what happened to Julia Shaw? Or did they simply not want to acknowledge her?

"Why look into the Shaw family now?" Andrew noticed the shift in her mood.

Luna smiled bitterly. "Julia Shaw might be my birth mother." She paused. "As for my birth father... you'd never guess."

"Sean Shaw?" Andrew raised an eyebrow. He'd found that phone call suspicious.

"Must you always be so sharp?" Luna glared at him but couldn't help laughing.

"Classic melodrama," Andrew muttered coldly. The thought of what Kevin Shaw had done to Luna made his eyes darken. He knew exactly what had become of that man.

Luna gazed out the window as a light rain began to fall in the twilight. The Shaw family's story might be far more complicated than she'd imagined.
###Chapter 454: Homecoming

"The Shaw family means nothing to me—not in the past, and not in the future. My parents were John and Mary White, and my siblings raised me. No one else counts!" Luna White declared firmly, drawing a clear line.

"Then what am I? Just 'no one else'?" Andrew Smith frowned, a bitter taste rising in his throat. After finally marrying her, he hadn't expected to be brushed aside so easily.

Seeing his rare pout, Luna couldn't help but burst into laughter.

"Andrew, you're my husband. How could you be an outsider?" She blinked playfully, teasing him. "If you keep underestimating yourself, your wife might get angry."

Andrew narrowed his eyes—this little troublemaker was getting bolder by the day.

"Just wait till we get home," he murmured, leaning close enough for his warm breath to brush her ear, his lips grazing her sensitive earlobe.

Luna's face flushed instantly. Ever since their marriage, the way Andrew looked at her had changed—like a wolf eyeing its prey. Though their new home wasn't ready yet, every moment alone with him sent her heart racing under that hungry gaze.

"We're on a train!" she hissed, fingers twisting nervously in her lap.

Andrew chuckled, tracing circles on her wrist. "Who started this, huh?"

Luna glared. Though their sleeper cabin was mostly empty, passengers could walk by any second. Two soldiers being this intimate in public? The gossip would be unbearable.

"Marrying you is harder than I thought," Andrew grumbled, but he released her hand anyway.

As the train pulled into Capital Station, Andrew carried both suitcases while Luna followed obediently, chattering about her last visit to the city.

The moment they stepped out, they spotted Nathaniel Smith waving in the distance.

"My brother insisted on meeting us," Andrew explained, though he'd tried to refuse.

Nathaniel rushed over, took the luggage, and punched his brother's shoulder. "You reckless brat! Nearly gave me a heart attack!" His voice cracked. "But seeing you safe... that's all that matters."

Andrew grinned, pulling Luna forward. "Relax, big brother. I'm tougher than I look. Oh, and meet your sister-in-law, Luna."

Luna stepped up with a sweet smile. "Hello, Nathaniel."
###Chapter 455: A Match Made in Heaven

"Dr. White! I've heard so much about you!" Andrew Smith's elder brother, Anthony, grabbed Luna White's hand and shook it enthusiastically. "My little brother is truly blessed to marry such an extraordinary woman. Don't worry—if he ever dares to mistreat you, I'll be the first to set him straight!"

Luna was momentarily stunned by the sudden warmth and instinctively hid slightly behind Andrew.

"You're too kind," she murmured, her fingers discreetly tugging at Andrew's sleeve.

Andrew chuckled and gently pulled Luna forward. "Brother, look what you've done—you've frightened our dear doctor."

"Oh, my apologies! I just got carried away," Anthony said, rubbing his hands together, his eyes gleaming. "Come on, the car's right ahead. Let's head home! Father has been talking about you two all morning—insisted I come fetch you personally."

Hanging back a step, Luna tugged at Andrew's sleeve. "What's up with your brother? He's... overwhelming."

Andrew leaned down, his breath warm against her ear. "Can you blame him? My wife is exceptional. When I told him about our battlefield wedding, he was so moved he called you a heroine—wants to adopt you as his little sister."

"Stop it!" Luna's cheeks flushed as she pinched him, only to wince when her fingers met his firm muscles.

Seizing the opportunity, Andrew caught her hand and lightly traced circles on her palm. "Pinch me all you want when we get home—anywhere you like."

"You're shameless!" Luna glared at him, but the tenderness in his gaze made her heart skip.

"What's taking you two so long?" Anthony called from the car, waving them over. "Hurry up—Father's waiting!"

Watching the couple's playful banter, Anthony couldn't help but smile. When Andrew had first told him about their impromptu wedding on the frontlines, he'd nearly teared up—a rare moment for a hardened man like him. Vows exchanged amid gunfire were more precious than any grand romantic gesture.

A woman like Luna was truly worthy of his finest brother.

Andrew carefully opened the car door for Luna before loading their luggage into the trunk. Through the rearview mirror, Anthony watched his brother's protective gestures, his lips curling upward.

"Seatbelt," Andrew murmured, leaning over to adjust Luna's strap—and stealing a quick kiss on her cheek.

Luna shoved him away, flustered. "Your brother's watching!"

"So what? I'm kissing my own wife," Andrew retorted, utterly unrepentant.

Anthony coughed pointedly. "Keep it decent, you two!" But his eyes sparkled with amusement.

As the car pulled away, Anthony studied the pair in the rearview mirror—one tall and handsome, the other elegant and refined. A perfect match in every way.

"How's everyone at home?" Andrew asked.

Anthony's expression flickered briefly. "Everything's fine... You'll see when we get there."
###Chapter 456: Confrontation

The trio stepped through the threshold.

Luna White's fingers trembled slightly, her heart pounding like a drum. Meeting her in-laws for the first time—who wouldn't be nervous?

Andrew Smith carried their luggage in one hand while firmly gripping her icy fingers with the other. "Don't worry, I'm here," he murmured, his deep voice steady and resolute. "If they give you trouble, we leave immediately."

She squeezed his hand in return, drawing warmth from his touch.

"Dad! Andrew brought his wife home!" Andrew Gao's booming announcement startled everyone in the living room.

Luna lifted her gaze to a room full of people.

The familiar face of Wei Shufen came into view, her smile so artificial it stung. Beside her sat an elderly man with sharp eyes and graying temples. The old man's expression softened with relief when he saw them.

"Mom, Dad, we're back," Andrew said, never letting go of Luna's hand.

An Cheng gave a slight nod. "Good to have you home."

"Let me see—were you hurt anywhere?" The elder scrutinized his son, exhaling in relief when he found him unharmed.

"Dad, this is Luna White, my wife." Andrew's voice was firm. "We're legally married, with the entire battalion as witnesses."

Only then did An Cheng study Luna properly. The delicate-looking young woman before him had stood beside his son through gunfire—such courage deserved respect.

"The journey must have been tiring," he said simply, his tone conveying acceptance.

Wei Shufen beamed and beckoned. "Come, sit by me. When we first met, I never imagined you'd be so brave. You and Andrew are truly meant to be."

Her affectionate demeanor made it seem as though past conflicts had never existed.

Andrew guided Luna to the opposite sofa without hesitation.

"Second Brother!" Andrew Xiang suddenly slammed the table and stood. "Mom invited her over—is this how you respond? Dr. White, don't you know basic manners when elders call for you?"

"Third Brother." Andrew's gaze turned icy. "This is our family matter. I decide who deserves respect."

"You—" Andrew Xiang's face flushed with anger. "Don't think your achievements make you untouchable! Have you forgotten how Mom packed your gear before every mission? This is how you repay her?"

Like a protective hen, he shielded Wei Shufen—the only mother he'd ever known.
###Chapter 457: Quite Pleased

"Mother!" Andrew Smith burst through the front door, his military boots thudding against the hardwood floor. "Would you care to explain why Luna was suddenly transferred to the frontlines? She's just an intern! Since when do they send interns to war zones?"

The air in the living room turned glacial.

Clara Smith's teacup trembled in her hands, spilling droplets onto the embroidered tablecloth.

Nathaniel Smith sprang to his feet. "Brother! Watch your tone! The front needs medics—why shouldn't she go?"

"Needs medics?" Andrew's medals glinted coldly under the chandelier as he scoffed. "Out of thousands at the military hospital, they specifically needed one intern?"

Luna White rested a calming hand on her husband's rigid forearm.

"Andrew, dear—" Clara began.

"It was my doing." Victor Smith emerged from the study, his voice steady.

Andrew's gaze turned arctic.

"Dr. White," Victor addressed Luna directly, "I orchestrated this. As a father, I have every right to vet my son's choices."

Luna's lips curved upward.

"Mr. Smith," she said brightly, "then I truly must thank you."

The room froze.

"Without your interference, Andrew and I might still be dragging our feet about marriage." Her smile deepened as she linked arms with Andrew. "Thanks to you, I'm now a licensed physician married to the love of my life." She tilted her head. "So you see, I'm certainly not the unhappy one here."

Andrew's tense shoulders finally relaxed.

"If Luna's satisfied," he said, sweeping his gaze across the stunned faces, "then I'm quite pleased too."

Clara's face drained of color.
###Chapter 458: The Slap

The living room fell into dead silence.

Andrew Smith narrowed his eyes slightly. He hadn't expected his seemingly gentle daughter-in-law to show such defiance.

"Dad! Look at her attitude!" An Zhiyuan—Andrew's third son—clutched his stinging cheek, disbelief flashing in his eyes. "She actually dared to hit me in our own home!"

Luna White slowly withdrew her hand, the faint smile still lingering on her lips. "Andrew Junior, this slap is to teach you manners. First, I, Luna White, live with integrity—I don’t need your judgment. Second, my marriage to your brother was approved by the authorities. It’s none of your business."

Andrew Smith stepped in front of Luna, his expression icy. "Apologize. Now."

"Brother! Have you lost your mind?" Andrew Junior trembled with rage. "Who does she think she is, demanding an apology from me?"

Slap!

Another sharp crack echoed through the room.

This time, it was Andrew Smith who delivered the blow.

"That one was from our parents," he said, his voice colder than steel. "Luna is my lawfully wedded wife. You will not insult her."

Suddenly, Old Man Smith burst into laughter. "Good! Very good!"

His wife, Eileen, tugged at his sleeve anxiously. "Andrew, what are you—"

"My son should have this kind of backbone!" Old Man Smith slammed his palm on the table, his piercing gaze fixed on Luna. "Girl, I knew I wasn’t wrong about you."

Luna met his eyes steadily. "Father, I respect you as my elder. But some things can’t be compromised."

Andrew Junior clutched both burning cheeks, his eyes filled with venom. "You... you’ve all gone mad! For an outsider—"

"Silence!" Old Man Smith roared. "One more word, and you’re out of this house!"

Andrew Junior froze. He had never seen his father this furious.

Luna gently linked her arm with Andrew’s. "Let’s go upstairs."

Andrew nodded, casting a final warning glance at his brother. "Remember—this is your last chance."

As the couple ascended the stairs, Old Man Smith murmured meaningfully to his wife, "That girl is worthy of our son."

Eileen fretted, "But Andrew Junior—"

"It’s time he grew up," Old Man Smith scoffed. "Acting like a gossipy old woman—what kind of soldier does that?"

At the second-floor landing, Luna suddenly stopped.

"What’s wrong?" Andrew asked.

A glint of steel flashed in Luna’s eyes. "Your brother won’t let this go."

Andrew tightened his grip on her hand. "I’m here."

Luna shook her head slightly. "This time, let me handle it."

Below them, a door slammed shut with a thunderous crash.

The storm had only just begun.
###Chapter 459: A Lesson in Slap

"Oh dear, Luna, my third son has no brains. Please be the bigger person and don't stoop to his level." Clara Smith wrung her hands anxiously, stepping forward to mediate. She never expected her seemingly gentle daughter-in-law would dare raise a hand in front of the entire family.

Luna White smirked coldly, shaking her stinging palm. "Mother, you make it sound so simple. If I hadn't slapped him today, who knows what vile rumors would've spread later?"

Her gaze sharp as a blade, she glared at Kevin Smith. "I've lived with integrity, and I won't tolerate a brother-in-law dictating my reputation. If today's words spread, what would people think of me as his sister-in-law?"

Kevin clutched his burning cheek, eyes wide with shock. "You—"

"Me what?" Luna cut him off mercilessly. "A twenty-one-year-old who still speaks without thinking. Should I teach you the consequences of loose lips?"

Andrew Smith stood nearby, his expression dark as storm clouds. Slowly, he stepped toward Kevin, his voice icy. "Apologize."

Kevin stubbornly jutted his chin. "Second Brother, I only spoke the truth! Fiona—"

Slap!

Another sharp crack echoed through the room.

This time, it was Andrew's hand that struck.

"Andy!" Clara gasped, heartbroken as her youngest son's face swelled instantly.

John Smith, seated on the sofa, snorted heavily. "Serves him right!"

Kevin stood dumbfounded, clutching both burning cheeks, tears welling in his eyes.

"Now. Immediately. Apologize to your sister-in-law," Andrew enunciated each word. "Or else—"

"Or else what?" Kevin lifted his head defiantly.

Andrew turned expressionlessly, taking Luna's hand. "Or else we leave now. This house won't hold both of us."

Clara panicked at his words. "Kevin! Apologize at once!"

Seeing his brother's resolute back and his father's livid face, Kevin finally grasped the gravity of the situation. Biting his lip, he reluctantly lowered his head. "Sister-in-law... I'm sorry..."

Luna regarded him coldly. "Remember this lesson. If I ever hear such words again—" She flexed her wrist. "I won't hesitate to teach you manners once more."

Andrew wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders, sweeping a stern gaze over the family. "This ends here. But if I hear anyone spreading gossip—" He paused, eyes sharp as daggers. "Don't expect mercy."

Without another word, he led Luna upstairs.

The living room fell deathly silent.

Kevin turned pitifully to his mother. "Mom—"

"Quiet!" Clara snapped, rare anger directed at her youngest. "Do you realize the disaster you nearly caused?"

John slammed his hand on the table, rising abruptly. "You insolent brat! Starting tomorrow, you're enlisting in the military! Clearly, you have too much free time!"

Kevin was utterly stunned. All he'd done was defend Fiona—how had he become the family's enemy?

Meanwhile, in the second-floor bedroom, Luna leaned into Andrew's embrace, a cold smile curling her lips.

This was only the beginning.
###Chapter 460: Not Even Worthy as an Opponent

"When Luna and I fought side by side on the front lines, this 'weak woman' carried me out of piles of corpses three times," Andrew Smith's voice was icy. "Bullets whizzed past her ears, and she didn't even blink. And you dare call her immoral?"

His fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

"Last warning—insult my wife again, even if you're my own brother, and you'll regret it." He grabbed Luna's hand with enough force to make her wince slightly. "The day she took a bullet for me, I swore I'd kill anyone who harms her."

Andrew's younger brother paled. He'd never seen his brother like this—the murderous rage in his eyes made his legs tremble.

"B-Brother..." he stammered, reaching out weakly. "I was wrong, okay?"

"Wrong?" Andrew scoffed before suddenly snatching a glass from the coffee table and smashing it to the ground. Shards flew everywhere, making his brother jump back.

"Apologize to my wife! Now!"

The younger Smith bowed deeply at a ninety-degree angle. "Sister-in-law, I'm sorry! I was a complete idiot!"

Luna gave a quiet hum, her gaze flickering to where Beatrice Green lurked at the stairwell, gripping the banister so hard her nails nearly dug into the wood.

"Little brothers are easily manipulated at this age," Luna said pointedly, her fingers lightly tracing Andrew's palm. "Let's go. I'm tired."

Immediately, Andrew bent to drape her coat over her shoulders, his earlier fury replaced with startling gentleness.

Beatrice forced a smile as she directed the servants to escort them, but her mind reeled. She'd thought Diana might at least put up a fight against Luna—how laughable. That fool wasn't even fit to polish Luna's shoes, let alone be her rival.

A door slammed upstairs hard enough to make the chandelier sway. Staring at the shattered glass, Beatrice realized with dawning horror—the balance of power in the Smith family had just shifted irrevocably.
###Chapter 461: Resolve

"Mom, Dad, we're going upstairs. Aunt Li doesn't need to show us the way—I remember my room." Andrew Smith's gaze swept over the unfamiliar housekeeper, his brow furrowing slightly.

It wasn't Aunt Niandi.

The woman who had cared for their family for over twenty years had become like family. His father had personally promised to provide for Aunt Niandi in her old age—why had she been replaced so abruptly?

Aunt Li nervously rubbed her hands together. "Your room is ready, Dr. White will stay in the guest—"

"Don't trouble yourself." Andrew cut her off coldly, taking Luna's hand as they ascended the stairs.

Flustered, Aunt Li looked toward Eileen Wei, who gave her a dismissive glance. "Go prepare lunch. Follow the menu I gave you—make sure to include all of Andrew's favorites."

So tactless.

Aunt Li retreated awkwardly.

Aaron Smith sidled up to his father with a grin, offering a cigarette. "Dad, now that Andrew's finally married, you can rest easy. He's really outdone himself, landing such an amazing wife."

Andrew Senior waved it away. "I quit."

"What?" Aaron nearly dropped the cigarette. "You—the lifelong chain-smoker—quit? I need a moment..."

"Brat! Isn't quitting a good thing?" Though Andrew Senior's scolding was loud, his eyes held amusement. This son of his had shown marked improvement lately.

Aaron slumped onto the sofa like a deflated balloon. "Dad only quit because he lost a bet with Uncle Johnson."

Regret gnawed at him.

Today had been a disgrace. A grown man, reduced to petty gossip like some backbiting housewife—this wasn't the Andrew Smith he knew himself to be.

As a propaganda officer, he might not have seen frontline combat, but the same blood ran in his veins as his brother. Given the chance, he wouldn't hesitate to lay down his life for his country.

Yet he'd let himself be swayed...

No matter what, Luna was still a woman. Why had he been so harsh?

Damn Diana!

Her constant weeping these past days, playing the jilted lover, had dragged him into this spiral...

No. Andrew shook his head sharply.

Blaming a woman? What kind of man did that make him? The prejudice had been his own doing.

His fists clenched.

It was time for field training. Only by weathering storms could he become a man worthy of the name.
###Chapter 462: Sharing a Bed

Andrew Smith grabbed Luna White's wrist and pulled her into his bedroom. His orderly had already neatly arranged their luggage in the corner.

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a warm glow on the slightly narrow single bed. Andrew narrowed his eyes, a meaningful smile playing at the corners of his lips.

"You take the bed. I'll sleep on the couch," he said deliberately, his fingers subtly tracing circles on her palm.

Luna glanced around. The room was more spacious than she had imagined. Military books stood in orderly rows on the shelves, and a framed photo of a younger Andrew sat on the desk.

"Captain Smith, your room is surprisingly tidy," she teased, running her fingertips along the edge of the desk.

Suddenly, Andrew wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder. "Luna, we've been married this long and still haven't shared a bed in our own home."

Her ears burned as she wriggled free. "Who said anything about sharing a bed with you?"

"I'll go buy a double bed." He snatched up his car keys and headed for the door.

Luna burst out laughing. "Andrew Smith, what exactly goes through your mind all day?"

He turned, his gaze intense. "My wife."

Those two simple words made her heart skip a beat. The man known for his stern demeanor now looked at her with tenderness that could melt ice.

"Go get some rest." Without warning, Andrew bent down and scooped her up in his arms.

Luna gasped, instinctively wrapping her arms around his neck. "What are you doing?"

"Fulfilling my husbandly duties." He gently deposited her on the bed and carefully removed her shoes.

She curled her toes. "I can do that myself—"

"Stay still." His fingers brushed against her ankle, sending a shiver up her spine. "We're meeting the superiors this afternoon. You need your rest."

His tone was serious, but his eyes told a different story.

Luna pulled the covers up to her nose. "You should go."

Andrew chuckled and pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Wait for me."

The moment the door clicked shut, Luna exhaled deeply. Rolling onto her back, she stared at the ceiling, her pulse still racing.

This was the room where Andrew had grown up. Faint pencil marks on the wall charted his childhood height, and medals from his youth adorned the desk.

A strange sense of wonder washed over her. The man everyone saw as unyielding and disciplined was now rushing out to buy a bed just so they could sleep side by side.

The thought made her laugh out loud.

Outside, an engine roared to life. She watched the car disappear down the road, her mind drifting back to that small county town.

Her eldest sister must be busy with the children by now. Had her brother found someone special? And what about Samuel—was he keeping up with his studies?

Luna closed her eyes. When they returned, she would make sure to visit them all properly.
###Chapter 463: The General's Summons

Andrew Smith and Luna White quickly passed through multiple security checkpoints with their specially approved letter of introduction. After verifying their credentials, the guard respectfully escorted them inside.

"Don't look around," Andrew murmured, his warm fingers giving hers a gentle squeeze.

Luna pressed her lips together and nodded. Armed sentries stood at every turn, their watchful eyes tracking every movement. She straightened her spine, terrified that one wrong move might get her mistaken for a spy.

"Nervous?" Andrew tilted his head toward her.

She glared. "You try it." In her past life, she'd been just a doctor—never someone who'd meet a high-ranking official like this.

Andrew suddenly leaned close, his breath warm against her ear. "They say the General loves braised pork."

"What?" Luna blinked.

"So..." Amusement danced in his eyes. "He definitely doesn't eat people."

A laugh nearly escaped her, the tension dissolving instantly. This man, so cold to others, always knew how to melt her fears away.

"Reporting! Andrew Smith and Luna White have arrived!"

"Enter."

The moment the door opened, Luna's breath caught. Behind the massive desk sat the elderly man she'd only ever seen on news broadcasts, the stars on his epaulets gleaming in the sunlight.

"General!" They saluted in unison.

The General set down his fountain pen, his sharp gaze sweeping over them. Luna felt like those eyes could see straight through her—like an X-ray.

"Sit." He gestured to the sofa.

When they remained standing, the old man's expression hardened. "That's an order!"

Luna startled, immediately copying Andrew's rigid posture. How did he make even the line of his neck look so effortlessly perfect?

"I heard about what happened at the wedding." The General's face softened into a smile, crow's feet fanning at his eyes. "A true pair of heroes."

Just as Luna prepared to demur, his tone shifted.

"But Dr. White..." He leaned forward, piercing eyes locking onto hers. "When you threw yourself into danger... were you truly unafraid to die?"

(Cliffhanger: The General's question strikes at Luna's deepest motives. How will she answer? And what will Andrew do?)
###Chapter 464: Promotion

"Reporting, sir. I do fear death." Luna White stood at attention, her voice crisp and clear.

Her heart pounded like a drum. If she'd known coming to the hospital would lead to life-or-death trials, she would've chosen the aviation academy instead. Flying planes—no matter how dangerous—had to be better than this.

Damn Ethan White and his silver tongue, talking her into this mess. And damn her own weak resolve, backing out of flight training just because it sounded tough.

Now she was paying the price.

"Fear death?" The general narrowed his eyes, his tone turning icy. "Yet you stood by Andrew Smith, ready to die with him? Or was that just pretty words?"

A chill ran down Luna's spine. This man's moods shifted faster than June weather.

"Sir, fearing death isn't shameful." She drew a steadying breath. "I'm barely twenty. My life's just begun. With family counting on me, how could I not fear death?"

She paused, her gaze hardening.

"But standing beside Andrew that day was my choice. If he could face death for duty, then as his fiancée, I'd stand with him. Even Death himself would have to go through us first."

"Good!" The general suddenly slammed the table, laughing. "Well said! That'd make Death think twice!"

His piercing eyes locked onto Luna. "You've got spine, girl. I heard Andrew was standing on a live mine when you joined him. That kind of courage is rare."

Luna exhaled quietly.

Looking back, even she couldn't explain her recklessness. Given another chance, she wasn't sure she'd make the same choice.

"Andrew." The general turned to the man beside her. "Your father served under me. The apple didn't fall far—you've surpassed him."

He lifted a file from the desk, approval flashing in his eyes. "Your record speaks for itself. Every step earned through merit."

Andrew gave a slight bow. "Thank you, sir."

No arrogance. No false modesty.

"By higher authority's decision," the general announced solemnly, "in recognition of your expertise and two acts of exceptional valor, you're hereby promoted two ranks. May you continue your exemplary work in Yun Province, training our next generation of soldiers."

The conference room fell utterly silent.
###Chapter 465: Mrs. Smith

Andrew Smith stood up abruptly, his military posture impeccable as he saluted crisply.

"Thank you for your guidance, General!"

His voice was steady and firm, as though this honor were nothing out of the ordinary.

Luna White blinked and discreetly tugged at Andrew's sleeve. She still hadn't grasped what this "two-rank promotion" actually meant.

"Dr. White," the General said warmly, turning to her. "Given your outstanding performance at the field hospital—particularly your breakthrough in acupuncture anesthesia—the board has decided to appoint you as the chief acupuncturist at Yunnan Provincial Hospital."

Luna's eyes widened in surprise.

"With one condition," the General added, raising a finger. "You must complete your medical degree within five years. The exact timeline and institution can be discussed with the hospital director. But this is non-negotiable."

"Understood, General!" Luna immediately straightened and saluted, her heart soaring.

Most doctors had to grind for at least five to seven years before earning such a promotion.

"As your former commanding officer, I have a personal request," the General said with a chuckle. "Your wedding was rushed last time. When you return to the capital, you must hold a proper ceremony."

Luna's face flushed instantly.

"Yes, General! Consider it done!" Andrew replied with exaggerated seriousness, earning a subtle pinch from Luna.

"Send me an invitation," the General laughed. "I watched Andrew grow up—I won't miss this toast!"

"Of course," Andrew nodded. "We're planning a family banquet to formally introduce Luna to everyone."

By the time they left the General's office, night had fallen.

"Andrew, what exactly does 'two-rank promotion' mean?" Luna asked the moment they got into the car.

Andrew shook his head in amusement. "You're a military doctor—how do you not know this?"

"I came into this halfway!" she retorted. "Just tell me!"

"Simply put, it means I'm now equivalent to..." Andrew murmured the rank.

"Wow!" Luna clapped a hand over her mouth, eyes sparkling. "Does that mean I'm now... Mrs. Smith?"

Andrew laughed and ruffled her hair. "Yes, my Mrs. Smith."

Luna lifted her chin triumphantly, her heart sweeter than honey. Her man was simply extraordinary.
###Chapter 466: Congratulations

Andrew Smith had barely stepped through the front door when he was enveloped by the jubilant atmosphere in the living room.

Andrew Senior rose from the sofa, his face flushed with pride. He strode forward in three quick steps and clapped his son heavily on the shoulder. "That's my boy! The old general just called me personally with the news. A bureau chief at twenty-five! I wasn't half as accomplished at your age!" His voice trembled with barely contained emotion. "Tonight, you're drinking with your old man!"

"Congratulations on your promotion, Andrew," Clara Smith said, approaching with a fruit platter. Though her smile was wide, her nails dug deep into her palms.

Her gaze flickered to the gleaming stars on Andrew's epaulets, feeling as though a thorn had lodged itself in her heart. If only Andrew had married Diana... the Wei family could have climbed this golden ladder. But now...

"Thank you, Father. Thank you, Clara." Andrew gave a slight nod, his eyes sweeping across the room. His elder brother Adrian lounged against the liquor cabinet, winking at him, while the youngest, Anthony, stood awkwardly in the corner.

"Little brother!" Adrian bounded forward, playfully punching Andrew's chest. "Look at you! The youngest bureau chief the Smith family's ever had!" Dressed in a tailored suit, he looked every inch the successful businessman—especially with the new imported car he'd driven home today.

Anthony shuffled over belatedly, his voice barely above a whisper. "Congratulations... Second Brother." His eyes darted to Andrew's crisp uniform, suddenly finding his own casual clothes painfully dull in comparison.

Clara watched the three young men, mental calculations whirring. Adrian's business was thriving, with branches rumored to have expanded to other provinces. But... Her expression darkened. Now all her hopes rested on Anthony—though the boy was disappointingly meek...

"Enough standing around," Andrew Senior boomed. "Clara, bring out the vintage Maotai!" He turned toward the kitchen. "Mrs. Wang, two more signature dishes!"

Under the crystal chandelier, Andrew's epaulets gleamed coldly. Clara's hands trembled slightly as she held her wine glass. She suddenly remembered the phone call last month from her eldest brother—"Little sister, about your nephew's job transfer..."

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, dusk gradually enveloped the military compound. No one noticed the unfamiliar blaze that had ignited in Anthony's eyes as he watched his second brother—a fire that had never been there before.
###Chapter 467: The Successor

A lavish feast covered the round table, the steaming dishes exuding tantalizing aromas. This meal served as both a welcoming banquet and a celebration of achievements, carrying extraordinary significance.

Andrew Smith and his three sons clinked glasses, toasting repeatedly as the wine flowed freely.

The old man was in exceptionally high spirits today. At his age, personal glory no longer mattered. When old comrades gathered, they inevitably compared their children's accomplishments.

His eldest son's insistence on leaving military service for business had once shamed him deeply. In a military family like theirs, following in a father's footsteps was the proper path. The eldest had been prime officer material yet chose an entirely different road.

Whenever asked about his firstborn's occupation, he'd always stammered evasively. But now everything had changed—youngest son Andrew's accomplishments allowed him to hold his head high. Tonight, countless old comrades would lie awake burning with envy.

"May all sons be like Andrew Smith"—this saying pleased him immensely.

This was true honor brought to the family name.

The future of the Smith lineage rested on these young shoulders.

As the drinking continued merrily, the elder Smith eventually collapsed in drunken oblivion. Even Andrew's brother remained too intoxicated to leave, requiring overnight accommodation.

Luna White finished dinner early, and Andrew considerately suggested she retire first. His mother also tactfully withdrew to her own quarters.

Pushing open the bedroom door, Luna froze.

A brand-new double bed dominated the room's center, complete with plush mattress and fresh linens. She couldn't suppress a smile—Andrew certainly worked quickly.

Emerging from her bath wearing the silk pajamas Lily Clark had handmade, Luna's snow-pale skin glowed against the blush-pink fabric. As she towel-dried her hair, the door suddenly swung open.

Andrew stood framed in the doorway, his military uniform impeccably pressed. The wall lamp's glow outlined his chiseled profile, his deep eyes holding unreadable emotions.

"Finished?" His low voice carried a whisper of wine.

Luna's pulse accelerated as she gestured hastily toward the bathroom. "I-I'm done. Your turn." She hurried to the vanity, pretending absorption in brushing her hair.

"Hmm." Andrew efficiently shed his uniform, retrieving fresh clothes from the wardrobe.

Pausing at the bathroom threshold, he glanced back at her: "Won't be long."

Two simple words that set Luna's ears burning. Before she could respond, the door clicked shut, leaving only the sound of rushing water.
###Chapter 468: Tell Me

The sound of running water in the bathroom stopped abruptly.

Luna White's heartbeat faltered. She clutched the edge of the blanket, her knuckles turning white. The bedside lamp cast her trembling shadow on the wall—a frightened fawn frozen in place.

"Calm down," she whispered to herself.

But her body refused to listen. Her fingertips tingled, and a thin layer of sweat formed on her back. She burrowed deeper under the covers, wrapping herself like a cocoon. The narrow gap between the two blankets became her last line of defense.

Click.

The bathroom door opened.

She squeezed her eyes shut, then peeked through her lashes. Andrew Smith stepped out, rubbing his damp hair. Water droplets trailed down his toned chest. Luna snapped her eyes closed again but couldn't suppress a giggle.

"What's so funny?"

His deep voice rumbled through the darkness. She bit her lower lip, her lashes fluttering.

"N-nothing." She shrank further under the covers. "Let's... sleep."

The mattress dipped. A wave of mint-scented warmth enveloped her, and she stiffened like a board. When Andrew's hand slipped under the blanket, she nearly yelped.

"Wai—"

Before she could protest, the world spun. His scorching chest pressed against her, his heartbeat thudding through the thin fabric of her pajamas. Luna held her breath, fingers twisting the sheets.

"Andy..."

The honeyed whisper made her own cheeks burn. His answering exhale against her neck seared like a brand.

"Tell me if it hurts."

Calloused fingers traced her waist, igniting shivers. She arched her neck, gripping his arm as dizziness swept over her. Moonlight filtered through the curtains, painting their tangled silhouettes on the wall.

When pain flared, she left crimson trails down his back. Andrew groaned, kissing away the tear clinging to her lashes.

The night stretched endlessly before them.
###Chapter 469: Your Father Is Here

Dawn's first light crept through the curtains as Luna White opened her eyes. A golden sunbeam slanted across the bed where Andrew Smith's arm still lay heavily around her waist, his warm breath brushing her bare shoulder.

She shifted slightly, wincing at the soreness in her lower back. Memories of the previous night flooded back, heating her cheeks.

"Awake?" His gravelly voice vibrated against her ear as he tightened his embrace, his stubble grazing her hair before he pressed a kiss to her shoulder.

Luna ducked her chin. "Stop it..."

"Still hurting?" His fingers traced the faint bruise at her waist.

She shook her head, then nodded. "Better than last night." Though her supernatural ability could heal it instantly, she secretly cherished this sweet ache.

Andrew suddenly rolled over, caging her beneath him, forehead touching hers. "Happy wedding, Mrs. Smith."

"Colonel Smith, you're fully responsible for me now." She poked his chest with a laugh.

Their morning intimacy quickly turned passionate. By the time Andrew carried her to the bathroom, the wall clock showed 9:30.

"This is your fault!" Flushed, Luna pushed him out. "Your parents must know everything..."

When she finally descended the stairs properly dressed, unfamiliar voices drifted from the living room. Aunt Clara hovered at the staircase, hesitating. "Dr. White... your father is here."

Luna froze, her sweater collar caught mid-adjustment. Slowly pulling it into place, her fingertips turned icy.

Sean Shaw? How dare he come to the Smith residence?

(Cliffhanger: Why has Sean Shaw suddenly appeared? How will Luna confront this unexpected "father"?)

###Chapter 470: The Father-Daughter Reunion Act

Luna White pulled on a turtleneck sweater and grabbed a pair of jeans. The reflection in the mirror showed a pale face with faint shadows under her eyes.

"Sean Shaw is here," she murmured to herself.

From the stairwell came Sean's hearty laughter: "Old Andrew! What a blessing that our families are uniting through marriage!"

Luna froze mid-step, her nails digging into her palms.

"Andrew, why didn't you tell me sooner that Luna is Sean's daughter?" Nathaniel Smith's voice held confusion.

"Dad, this matter—" Andrew Smith began, but was interrupted by a sickly sweet female voice.

"Brother Andrew, it's only natural that Sister holds resentment. Father has missed her all these years."

Luna's lips curled into a cold smile. Kelsey Shaw had arrived, as expected.

She descended the stairs slowly, and all eyes in the living room turned toward her. Sean stood up, visibly moved, while Kelsey fluttered toward her like a gaudy butterfly.

"Sister!" Kelsey grabbed Luna's hand, tears glistening in her eyes. "I should have recognized you sooner..."

Luna yanked her hand back as if touching something filthy.

"Who are you calling 'sister'?" Her voice was icy. "My parents were John and Mary White of Six Paths Village. Don't claim kinship where there is none."

Andrew stepped forward. "Luna hasn't had breakfast yet. We should—"

"Luna!" Sean choked out, blocking her path with trembling hands. "I know you hate me... but blood ties can't be changed!"

His eyes reddened as he reached out shakily. "Your father failed you... You've suffered all these years..."

Luna stared at the middle-aged man's "heartfelt" performance, her stomach churning.

"I came today to discuss the wedding with your in-laws," Sean wiped his eyes. "My daughter's marriage must be a grand affair!"

A mocking smile played on Luna's lips. This father-daughter reunion act was truly over-the-top.

She knew exactly what Sean was plotting—using this "reconciliation" to climb the social ladder through the Smith family.

Too bad she wasn't the naive fool from her past life.

"Mr. Shaw," Luna enunciated each word. "My wedding requires no interference from outsiders."

Sean's face stiffened. Kelsey rushed forward. "Sister, Father truly—"

"Shut up!" Luna snapped. "Call me 'sister' one more time, and I'll make sure you never speak again."

The air turned frigid.

Andrew wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders, his gaze frosty as it swept over the Shaw father and daughter. "You should leave now."

The cracks finally showed in Sean's loving facade. He hadn't expected this country-raised daughter to be so formidable.
###Chapter 471: Only You in This Lifetime

"Sorry, but my wedding is already over." Luna White cast a cold glance at the middle-aged man before her. "And sir, we're practically strangers. If you insist on calling me your daughter, I can't stop you. But falsely claiming kinship won't benefit you—I'm Luna White, and I have nothing to do with you. Not in the past, and certainly not in the future."

She linked arms with Andrew Smith, her voice turning even frostier. "I lived in Six Paths Village for years, and you had plenty of chances to acknowledge me. Yet you only come knocking now, after I've become a Smith. If you think I don't see through your motives, you're delusional."

Sean Shaw's face flushed with embarrassment before paling again. He turned to Andrew's father, Anthony Smith, with an awkward smile. "She's still holding a grudge... I understand—I failed her..."

Anthony waved a dismissive hand. "It's natural for her to feel resentful. These things take time." But inwardly, he remained wary. As her father-in-law, it wasn't his place to interfere in family matters.

In the dining room, Andrew was ladling red bean porridge into Luna's bowl. His slender fingers gripped the porcelain spoon, the rich aroma wafting up as the porridge swirled invitingly.

"Good for blood replenishment," he said with perfect seriousness.

Luna nearly choked. Since when did her aloof military officer learn to flirt like this?

"Commander Smith, you've gotten bold," she muttered under her breath.

Andrew methodically peeled a hard-boiled egg. "This is bold? Then last night—"

"Stop!" Luna shot to her feet, her ears burning crimson. This man had no filter anymore.

A firm hand pulled her back into her seat.

"Running away?" He held the peeled egg to her lips, amusement glinting in his eyes. "Feeling better now?"

Suddenly, she understood—he was teasing her to lift her mood.

Her heart softened instantly.

"You're the best," she mumbled around a bite of egg.

Andrew leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "What if I treated someone else this well?"

Luna bristled immediately. "Then I'd remarry!"

Regret hit her the moment the words left her mouth. Andrew's gaze darkened, his grip tightening around her wrist.

"Don't even think about it," he growled, his voice rough with possessiveness. "You're mine—"

She shrank back sheepishly. "You started it..."

"What did I say?" Andrew sighed. This jealous little thing.

"You said you'd be nice to someone else!" Her eyes reddened as she glared at him.

The next second, she was pulled into a warm embrace. Andrew pressed a kiss to her hair, his voice tender.

"Silly girl, you're the only one I'll ever spoil."

Luna buried her face against his chest, their heartbeats thunderous in unison.

This man—so serious yet so devastatingly sweet—was playing completely unfair.
###Chapter 472: The Ungrateful Wretch

Luna White had just set down her chopsticks when she noticed the Shaw father-daughter duo had vanished.

"That ungrateful wretch!" Sean Shaw's face darkened with rage. His carefully laid plans had been ruined in an instant.

He'd had his sights set on the Smith family connections for weeks. The final approval for his new jewelry store was being held up by an obstinate bureau director. After much digging, he'd discovered the man was an old subordinate of Andrew Smith—only the Smith name had gotten him a foot in the door. Yet the official insisted on Andrew's personal confirmation.

"Don't lose your temper, Father." Kelsey Shaw gently patted his back. "There's more to Luna's hostility than meets the eye. My brother's matter is long settled, yet she looks at me like I'm her mortal enemy."

It baffled her. She'd always excelled at charming people, yet Luna remained impervious.

"Drive!" Sean slammed the car door shut.

"She's just jealous," he scoffed. "Seeing your privileged life reminds her of her own miserable past. Typical small-town mentality."

Kelsey shook her head. "No. I know the difference between envy and hatred." That icy glare still sent chills down her spine.

"Regardless, we must make Luna acknowledge her lineage," Sean massaged his temples. "She's our bridge to both the Smith and Johnson families."

"I'll pay Shawn Johnson a visit." A calculating gleam flashed in Kelsey's eyes. "Once rumors start circulating, who cares about the truth?" Her pulse quickened at the thought of the aloof, aristocratic man.

"Be cautious." Sean squeezed his daughter's hand. "The Shaw family's future rests on you now."

"Don't worry, Father." Kelsey smiled sweetly. "I'm planning a trip to Yun Province to source raw gemstones—expand our market reach."

Sean nodded approvingly. This daughter of his was worth ten of his useless son.
###Chapter 473: No Trouble at All

Luna had just changed her clothes when Andrew pulled her into the living room. His father, An Cheng, and stepmother, Wei Shufen, sat stiffly on the sofa, their expressions grim.

"Dad, Auntie," Luna greeted politely, her gaze flickering to Andrew. He gave her a reassuring wink.

"Have a seat," An Cheng gestured to the opposite couch.

Luna's stomach tightened. News of the Shaws' visit must have spread. She clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. Whatever was coming, she'd face it head-on.

"Dad, there's something we wanted to discuss," Andrew interjected smoothly. "The General mentioned attending our wedding, but Luna and I prefer something simple."

An Cheng's eyebrow lifted. "Oh?"

"We already had our real wedding at the frontlines—that's the memory we cherish," Andrew said, squeezing Luna's hand. "This time, we just want an intimate gathering with family and friends. No need for fanfare, even if the General attends."

Wei Shufen immediately protested, "That won't do! It's unfair to Luna." She turned saccharine eyes toward Luna. "A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event for a woman. How could we cut corners?"

Luna's lips curved slightly. What a convincing performance.

"Auntie, I don't feel slighted," she said softly. "What matters is our union, not the ceremony."

An Cheng nodded approvingly. "It's admirable that you young people think this way. But certain traditions should still be observed."

"Exactly," Andrew agreed cheerfully. "That's why we'd like Auntie to handle the arrangements—keeping everything minimal."

Wei Shufen's smile faltered for a split second. "I... wouldn't want to impose. I might not meet your expectations."

"How could that be?" Luna's voice dripped honey. "You've always treated Andrew as your own son. I'm sure you'll plan everything perfectly."

She emphasized "your own son," catching the flicker of panic in Wei Shufen's eyes. Luna suppressed a cold laugh. Did this woman really think she'd forgotten her past cruelty toward Andrew?

An Cheng patted his wife's hand. "Then it's settled. Shufen, do take care of it."

"Of course," Wei Shufen forced out, her nails nearly drawing blood from her palms.

Luna sipped her tea, watching through the steam as resentment flashed in Wei Shufen's eyes.

The real performance had only just begun.
###Chapter 474: The Passbooks

"Dad, I'd like to take Luna shopping for the wedding. It's a once-in-a-lifetime event—she deserves the best." Andrew tightened his grip on Luna's hand.

Clara immediately pulled out a passbook from her pocket and offered it to Luna. "Andrew, Luna, this is a small gift from your father and me."

Luna hesitated, glancing at Andrew for guidance.

"Take it. It's their blessing," Andrew said with a smile, giving her palm an encouraging squeeze.

"Thank you, Mom and Dad." Luna accepted it graciously, her fingers lightly tracing the cover.

Jack checked his watch. "Discuss the arrangements with your mother. I have a meeting to attend." As he stood, Clara was already there with his scarf, deftly wrapping it around his neck.

Andrew led Luna upstairs. "Let's go to our room first."

The moment they entered, Luna handed the passbook back to Andrew.

"Why give it to me?" He chuckled, pushing it away before retrieving two passbooks from the drawer. "These are what I wanted to give you."

Luna's eyes sparkled. "What are these?"

"The blue one is my mother's inheritance. The red one is my savings over the years." He placed them in her hands. "From now on, you'll manage our household."

When Luna flipped open the blue passbook, her eyes widened in shock. The balance clearly read: 30,000 yuan.

"This much?"

"It's not much," Andrew said softly, sitting on the bed as he watched her count the amounts with tender amusement. "What's mine is yours."

She then opened the red passbook, where neat entries recorded each deposit, totaling 5,000 yuan. The memory of the 500 yuan he'd once pressed into her hand warmed her heart.

Finally, she checked Clara's passbook. 500 yuan—no more, no less.

"Figured it out?" Andrew laughed at her expression and pulled her into his arms.

"Hmm?"

"Dad's rule—500 yuan for each son's wedding." His fingers combed through her hair. "When it's the third son's turn, there'll be chaos."

Luna burst into laughter. "Your dad is something else."

"So..." Andrew suddenly turned serious, cupping her face. "Trust me. You'll have everything others do."

"Then let's go shopping now!" Luna sprang up, dragging him toward the door. "I'm emptying the department store!"

Andrew stumbled but laughed indulgently as sunlight streamed through the window, stretching their intertwined shadows across the floor.
###Chapter 475: Platinum Bands

The sunlight was perfect as Andrew Smith held Luna White's hand, weaving through the bustling commercial street. The department store's glass façade glittered under the sun, flanked by rows of small shops with vendors calling out their wares.

"Luna, let's get you some new clothes," Andrew suggested, pointing to a beige trench coat in a display window.

Luna shook her head. "We wear uniforms most of the time. Anything else would just collect dust." She gestured toward a watch shop across the street. "You, on the other hand—how long has your watch been broken?"

Andrew instinctively touched the motionless timepiece on his wrist, damaged by shrapnel during a mission. Before he could protest, Luna pulled him into the shop.

"What about this one?" She indicated a mechanical watch with a black dial.

Andrew opened his mouth to refuse, but Luna had already asked the clerk to wrap it up. Warmth flooded his chest, and he suddenly tugged her outside. "Now it's your turn—we're getting your ring."

Inside the gold shop, everything gleamed ostentatiously. Luna frowned at the chunky gold bands in the display case, imagining herself administering injections while wearing one. She shuddered.

"Not your style?" Andrew immediately picked up on her hesitation.

"Too... flashy," she said diplomatically.

Without another word, Andrew led her to a payphone on the corner. Half an hour later, they stood before an understated jewelry boutique.

"Second Brother!" A ponytailed girl bounded out cheerfully. "This must be my future sister-in-law! I’m Vivian Ye, Nathaniel’s cousin."

Luna blinked in surprise at the girl, who appeared around her age. Vivian ushered them inside with enthusiasm. "I heard you’re here for matching bands? Wait right here—I’ll bring out the newest designs."

Three velvet trays lined the glass counter. Vivian lifted the lid of the first. "These are platinum with diamond accents—simple yet elegant, perfect for professionals like you."

Luna’s eyes lit up. The rings had clean, fluid lines, their diamonds catching the light with understated brilliance. She picked one up, examining the trio of tiny stones embedded along the band—subtle yet refined.

"Do you like it?" Andrew murmured near her ear.

The tips of Luna’s ears pinked as she nodded. Vivian stifled a giggle. "Excellent taste, Sister-in-law. This is our designer’s latest piece—called 'Stardust.'"

Andrew slid on the men’s band, the platinum’s cool sheen complementing his strong, defined fingers. When their hands intertwined, Luna’s pulse quickened.

"We’ll take this pair," Andrew declared, then shot Vivian a playful look. "Give your sister-in-law the family discount?"

Vivian grinned, thumping her chest. "Absolutely! You’ll leave happy—guaranteed!"
###Chapter 476: The Mark of Belonging

Luna White finally settled on a pair of understated platinum rings. The bands bore only a few minimalist flowing lines, devoid of any excessive ornamentation. Her fingers traced the inner circle of the ring as an unconscious smile curved her lips.

"These are perfect." She slid the men's ring onto Andrew Smith's slender ring finger.

Andrew fidgeted with the unfamiliar metal band. Years of military training had left his hands unaccustomed to such adornments, and he kept wanting to touch it. "This might interfere with drills—"

Before he could finish, Luna rose on her toes to brush her lips against his. "I've got a solution."

She turned and selected a delicate silver chain that shimmered softly under the store lights. With practiced ease, she threaded the ring onto the chain and looped it around Andrew's neck.

"Now it won't get in your way." Her fingertips fastened the clasp, letting the ring rest precisely over his heart. "I asked Vivian to engrave our initials inside."

Andrew looked down at the pendant, the usual sternness in his features melting away. He took Luna's hand and saw the letters "AZY" etched inside her ring.

"Bro! Sis!" Vivian Ye suddenly bounded out from behind the counter, her eyes sparkling. "This idea is genius!"

She seized Luna's hand. "Sis, can we license this design for the store? I'll get the patent processed for you!"

Andrew immediately pulled Luna behind him. "Not a chance."

"Please!" Vivian stomped her foot in frustration. "This is so romantic! A lover's name engraved on a ring worn close to the heart—it'll be a bestseller for sure!"

The cashier suddenly intercepted Andrew as he moved to pay. "The manager's instructions—your purchases today are complimentary."

Meeting Vivian's hopeful gaze, Luna chuckled and nodded. "Alright, you have my permission."

"Long live Sis!" Vivian whooped, lunging forward only to be deftly blocked by Andrew.

"Royalties will be paid in full," Andrew stated coolly, though his fingers tightened around Luna's. The engraved ring pulsed against his skin, perfectly synced with his heartbeat.
###Chapter 477: The Layoff Storm

The fire crackled in the stove, filling the room with the warm aroma of roasted peanuts.

Iris White pinched a peanut between her fingers, her hand trembling slightly. "The factory held another meeting today," she said, her voice tight. "Starting next month, they'll only pay basic wages." She swallowed hard. "Henry... we might lose our jobs."

Henry Cooper tossed another coal briquette into the stove, sending sparks flying. "Don't worry. I'll take care of us, no matter what." He cracked open a peanut and pressed the kernel into his wife's palm. "Try it. Fresh from this year's harvest. Sweet as can be."

Iris had no appetite. The food factory's warehouse was overflowing with unsold stock, and rumors of layoffs swirled among the workers. "We're both in our forties. If we really lose our jobs..." She clutched the edge of her apron. "Hannah's tuition, Charlie's wedding..."

"Shh—" Henry suddenly perked up. Outside, the jingle of a bicycle bell rang out, followed by the postman's shout: "Henry Cooper! Money order!"

Henry bolted out the door and returned moments later, waving a green slip triumphantly. "Look! William sent money again—five thousand this time!" His eyes gleamed. "That boy's doing well in the city."

Iris counted the zeros on the slip, her hands shaking. "This much money... What kind of business is he running there?"

"Doesn't matter, as long as it's honest." Henry carefully folded the money order. "Perfect timing. Let's visit the city for the New Year. I heard..." He lowered his voice. "People are buying trucks for hauling goods. One trip can earn you this much." He flashed a hand signal.

Iris gasped. "You're not thinking—"

The firelight cast sharp shadows across Henry's determined face. "If the factory really goes under, we can't just sit here waiting to starve." He squeezed his wife's cold hands. "I've got a driver's license, and all these years driving for the factory, never a single accident. William wrote that the city's booming with construction—they don't have enough trucks to haul materials."

Outside, the first snow of winter began to fall. Iris watched the flakes swirl and whispered, "Maybe... we should leave early? There's no work at the factory anyway."

Henry grinned. "My thoughts exactly! We'll buy tickets tomorrow and take the kids with us." He winked. "And while we're there... we'll check out the truck market."

Iris's heart raced. She remembered her sister's last letter, raving about the bustling night markets in the city. "Actually..." she hesitated. "The neighbors always say my pickles taste better than the factory's..."

The couple exchanged a smile. The firelight flickered behind them, their shadows merging into something new.
###Chapter 478: Surprise Visit

Thin wisps of smoke curled up from the chimney of the Clark family's courtyard in the village.

Clara Clark busily stuffed items into a woven bag. "We must bring this jar of pickled radishes. Lily always loved my homemade recipe. And this cured bacon—you won't find anything this authentic in the city."

"Do as you see fit," grumbled George Clark, squatting on the doorstep with his pipe. His furrowed brows could have crushed a fly. "Something doesn't sit right with me."

"You're just restless!" Clara shot him a look, her hands never pausing. "Haven't you missed our daughter? It's been two years."

The mention tightened both their hearts.

Their Lily had become like a wild horse since leaving for the city to start her business. Phone calls always boasted booming sales, and she never failed to send 500 dollars home each month—yet she stubbornly refused to visit.

Two days ago, she'd crossed a line: claiming her business kept her too busy to return even for the New Year.

"Our sons are stationed with the military, and now Lily won't come home either. What's the point of celebrating?" Clara's eyes reddened.

George knocked his pipe against his shoe sole. "That's exactly why we're going. Who knows what that girl's really up to in the city?"

The decision was made—they'd launch a surprise inspection.

"Do you think Lily might be seeing someone?" Clara suddenly whispered. "She's twenty already..."

"Hmph!" George's expression darkened further. "Last time I mentioned an arranged match on the phone, she hung up on me. That ungrateful—"

As the hens clucked in the yard, Clara wiped her hands. "Sell the pig tomorrow, and I'll take the poultry to town. We'll be gone at least two months—can't let them starve."

"Already handled." George stood, dusting his trousers. "Old Walter's coming for the pig at dawn."

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground. Clara gazed toward the village entrance, murmuring, "I wonder what Lily looks like now..."

George remained silent, but his grip on the pipe tightened.
###Chapter 479: A Miserable Day

Old Man Walter Wallace was seething with anger.

His wife had gone to the city to help with their daughter-in-law's postpartum care and hadn't returned. Over the phone, she'd gushed about Luna giving birth to a healthy baby girl, her voice dripping with delight as if she'd won the lottery.

"Tch! What's so special about a girl?" Walter spat bitterly.

His eldest son was so accomplished—successful, capable—so why had he married a divorcee? And now, they couldn't even produce a grandson. That foolish wife of his was happily playing nursemaid in the city while he was left alone at home.

No warm meals, no company—just a cold stove and an empty house.

The more Walter thought about it, the angrier he became. Snatching up a broom, he stormed toward the pigpen. The pigs, hearing his approach, grunted and shuffled closer.

"What're you staring at?" Walter smacked the fence with the broom. "Even you lot think you can laugh at me?"

The pigs scattered in fright.

His second son had returned from the city last year, acting like he'd been possessed, dead set on starting a business. Walter had beaten him, cursed him—but the brat had just packed up and moved to town with his wife and kids.

Last month, during the market day, Walter had spotted his second son's shop from afar. The glass display windows gleamed, filled with colorful modern clothes. Young women and housewives streamed in and out, while his son and daughter-in-law bustled about, barely able to keep up.

Walter had hidden in an alley across the street, watching for ages—but he hadn't dared step inside.

"Ungrateful wretch!" he muttered, squatting on his doorstep and puffing furiously on his pipe, the bowl clacking loudly with each agitated tap.

His third son was at least obedient, always keeping his head down and working. But the fool couldn’t even tell when the pigs were sick—only speaking up when they stopped eating. Last winter, he’d nearly lost an entire pen of pigs, sending Walter into a rage.

Now, with the New Year approaching, the pigs were fattened and ready for market—but Walter felt no joy.

"It's all that vixen's fault!" he hissed through gritted teeth.

If Luna hadn’t seduced his son, would his eldest have abandoned the family business to play stepfather in the city? Now, his eldest was living large in the city, his second thriving in town—and here he was, an old man left to rot in a crumbling house.

The bitterness gnawed at him. Grabbing a bottle of cheap liquor, he took a deep swig. The harsh burn made him cough violently, tears and snot streaking his face.

The pigs started grunting again, as if mocking him.

"Shut up!" Walter hurled the bottle at them. It shattered, glass shards spraying across the ground. Staggering to his feet, he kicked over the feeding trough.

Dusk settled in, cold wind whipping dried leaves into spirals. Slumping onto the doorstep, Walter stared at the empty yard—his heart just as hollow.

In the distance, firecrackers popped—someone celebrating a happy occasion. Walter pulled out a rock-hard steamed bun his wife had left behind and took a savage bite. His teeth ached from the force.
###Chapter 480: The Plague Strikes

"Pa! Pa! Something terrible's happened!" Walter's third son Nathaniel stumbled into the yard, his face ashen.

Old Walter was organizing farming tools when the shout made him fumble his hoe. It clattered to the ground. His third son had always been steady—if he was this panicked, disaster had struck.

"What is it?" Walter's heart pounded.

"The pigs—all collapsed in the pen!" Nathaniel stamped his feet. "Foaming at the mouth, they're dying!"

Walter's vision darkened. Those forty hogs were their family's entire hope! Two more months and they'd be ready for market, each weighing at least two hundred pounds. After losing money all year to livestock illnesses, this batch was supposed to recoup their losses.

"Move!" Walter grabbed the medicine kit and ran to the pen.

Silence. Forty hogs lay motionless, white foam dripping from their mouths. Walter's stomach clenched—he knew these symptoms too well. Swine fever.

"Boil the herbs!" His voice shook. Their ancestral remedy had cured countless pig ailments, but this time, doubt gnawed at him.

The medicine did nothing. By noon, over a dozen hogs had died. Walter crouched outside the pen, fingernails digging into his palms.

"Pa...should we call the veterinary station?" Nathaniel ventured.

"Nonsense!" Walter lurched upright. "Those vaccines cost two dollars per dose—how much medicine could we buy with that?" But as another hog stiffened, his throat tightened. "Go...fetch them."

The young vet arrived swiftly but shook his head after examination. "Too late. They're beyond saving."

Walter slumped at the pen's entrance, watching the last hog take its final breath. Forty hogs—gone. He pounded the dirt, mud cramming under his nails.

A whole year's labor—wasted.
###Chapter 481: Emergency Call

Old Man Walter lay on the kang, his forehead burning hot. The damp towel on his head quickly grew warm from the fever. His cheeks were flushed, his lips cracked and blistered, and he kept muttering incoherently.

Ryan's younger brother, Sanxi, paced anxiously.

"Stay with Dad," he told his wife before grabbing his coat and rushing out. "I'm calling Second Brother, then First Brother!"

He ran until he was out of breath, terrified something might happen to his father.

The house was in chaos.

All the pigs in the pen had died, and now their father was gravely ill. Sanxi, a simple farmer, had never faced such a crisis. It felt like the sky was falling.

Meanwhile, Ryan Wallace was living his best life. His wife, Luna, had given birth to a daughter. Though some might dismiss her as "just a girl," Ryan adored her.

Every day after returning from his hot pot restaurant, the first thing he did was wash up, change clothes, and smother his baby girl with kisses. At just seven or eight months old, the chubby little thing was already a charmer.

"Tangyuan, Daddy's home!" Ryan called as soon as he stepped inside.

Hearing his voice, little Tangyuan immediately wiggled her arms and legs, babbling excitedly. If she could talk, Ryan was sure she'd already be calling him "Daddy."

The girl was sharp—she recognized everyone, greeted them with dimpled smiles, and had her three older brothers wrapped around her tiny fingers.

"Luna's Spicy Hot Pot" had become a renowned brand in the provincial capital. Ryan now owned five branches, each thriving. He was even planning to expand to neighboring provinces next year.

Then the phone rang.

Ryan picked up. "Hello?"

"Big Brother! It's Sanxi!" His younger brother's voice trembled with tears.

Ryan's heart dropped. "What's wrong? Slow down."

"Dad's sick... the pigs are all dead... he's delirious with fever... I'm scared... I—" Sanxi stammered.

Ryan's face paled. Those pigs were their father's pride and joy.

"Listen, Sanxi," he said firmly, forcing himself to stay calm. "Get a tractor and take Dad to the county hospital now. If money's an issue—"

"We have enough! Dad's savings are under his pillow!"

"Good. Mom and I will book tickets home immediately. Don't panic—hold the family together like a man, understand?"

Hanging up, Ryan's hands still shook. But he knew panic wouldn't help now.

Sanxi wiped his tears. His brother was right—he had to be strong and carry the family through this.
###Chapter 482: Emergency Homecoming

"Luna! Stop what you're doing!" Ryan Wallace burst through the accounting office door, his voice uncharacteristically urgent.

Luna Whitaker looked up from the ledger she'd been reviewing. She'd returned to work shortly after giving birth, unable to watch Ryan struggle alone with the shop's affairs.

"What's wrong?" Her sharp eyes immediately noted her husband's distress.

"It's Dad." Ryan's Adam's apple bobbed. "Mom and I need to leave immediately."

The pen slipped from Luna's fingers and clattered onto the desk. Ryan hadn't spoken to his father since being disowned. Not even their daughter's birth had warranted a notification.

"How bad?" she asked quietly.

Ryan's face paled. "Sanxi says he's been taken to the county hospital."

Without another word, Luna stood. "You get the tickets. I'll withdraw money from the bank." Medical bills were no stranger to her.

Ryan caught her hand. Their eyes met—no explanations needed. He turned and rushed out, the roar of his car engine fading quickly.

In the adjoining room, Eleanor Wallace played with her giggling granddaughter. Little Dumpling clung to her grandmother's blouse with tiny fists. The child had been attached to Eleanor since birth, crying whenever she awoke to find her gone.

The old woman doted on the girl now. Initially disappointed at having a granddaughter, she'd softened watching her son's devotion. After a month of caring for the baby, she couldn't imagine life without her.

"Mom!"

Luna entered with the child. "Pack your things quickly. Dad's in the hospital. Ryan's gone to buy train tickets."

Eleanor's hands trembled, nearly dropping the baby. "What? What happened to Walter?"

"They think it's a stroke. Sanxi already took him to the county hospital."

Flustered, Eleanor handed the child back to Luna and ran home, still wearing her apron.

The train station buzzed with noise. Ryan paid a premium for two standing tickets before rushing home for his mother. Luna pressed a thick envelope into his hands. "Twenty thousand. Call if you need more."

The train rumbled through the night.

Under the stark hospital corridor lights, Erniu and Sanxi crouched outside a room. Their eyes reddened when they saw Ryan.

"Where's Dad?" Ryan's voice shook.

Inside the room, Walter Wallace lay motionless, his face ashen.

"The doctor says... it's a stroke." Sanxi wiped his face. "We got him here in time, but... he hasn't woken up."

Ryan drew a deep breath. "It'll be alright. Remember when Luna's grandmother had a stroke? She recovered."

Eleanor collapsed at the bedside, tears streaming as she clutched her husband's hand. How could this happen after just one year apart?
###Chapter 483: Broke

"Sanxi, did you handle those sick pigs at home?" Ryan Wallace asked breathlessly, sweat beading on his forehead.

Sanxi rubbed his hands nervously, avoiding eye contact. "Bro, I couldn't get to it. With Dad suddenly falling ill, we've been scrambling. The pigs are still in the pen."

Ryan's face darkened. "That won't do! We're here to take care of Dad—you need to go back and deal with those pigs immediately." He lowered his voice. "If some shady butcher gets their hands on them, people could die!"

Sanxi stammered, "Elder Brother... maybe you should handle the pigs? I'll stay here with Dad..."

Ryan suppressed a sigh. His younger brother was honest to a fault, but utterly spineless.

"Fine," he relented. "I'll take care of the pigs. You two stay here with Mom and Dad." He pulled out his wallet. "Get a double room so you can take shifts resting. Eat properly—don't run yourselves ragged."

Sanxi and Erniu exchanged uneasy glances.

Ryan frowned. "What now?"

Erniu's face flushed crimson before he blurted out, "Bro... My business just started up. All my cash is tied in inventory. We only scraped together two thousand for the deposit, and today the hospital said... the funds are almost gone..."

Without hesitation, Ryan pulled two thick wads of bills from his bag. "Here's ten thousand. Pay the fees first, then use the rest for proper meals. Don't skimp."

His brothers' eyes glistened. When push came to shove, their eldest brother always came through.

"Take care of Mom—don't let her grieve too hard," Ryan instructed. "I'm heading back now. I don't like leaving Sanxi's wife alone at home."

At the bus station, he bought the earliest ticket back to the village.

Villagers greeted him along the way: "Ryan's back?" "How's the old man doing?"

He responded distractedly, his mind racing. Every minute those diseased pigs remained unprocessed was another minute of danger. His sister-in-law was too trusting—what if some smooth-talker showed up?

His footsteps quickened at the thought.
###Chapter 484: A Matter of Conscience

As the courtyard gate swung open, Ryan Wallace spotted two shifty-eyed men shoving money into his sister-in-law's hands.

"What the hell are you doing?" he barked.

The men startled, hastily hiding the cash behind their backs. His sister-in-law hurried forward with baby Jinbao in her arms, relief washing over her face. "Brother Ryan, they're here to buy the pigs. Said it's a shame to waste dead livestock—offering twenty per head. Forty pigs would get us eight hundred..."

Ryan sneered. Just like his spineless younger brother, this woman had no backbone.

"What's your game?" His gaze turned razor-sharp.

One man rubbed his hands obsequiously. "No games, sir! We're just helping out. Such a waste otherwise—"

"These are diseased!" Ryan bit out each word.

The men exchanged glances. "Nonsense! Just common cold—"

"Bullshit!" Ryan grabbed a broom from the corner and swung. "You'd profit from poison? Want blood on your hands?"

The broom whooshed through the air, sending the pair scrambling to the gate.

"Let's talk this through! We can raise the price—"

"Out!" Another swing. "The Wallaces would rather starve than deal with vultures like you!"

Dodging frantically, they upped their offer. "Twenty-two! Twenty-two per head!"

Ryan snatched a shovel. "Next swing breaks legs!"

Seeing his determination, the profiteers finally fled, cursing under their breath. The sister-in-law stood frozen, clutching her child.

Ryan planted the shovel firmly and glared. "Next time, chase them off with a stick. Understood?"

She shrank back. "Y-yes, Brother Ryan."

Outside, the merchants' grumbles faded.

"Who does he think he is?"
"Just wait—they'll come begging soon enough!"

Alone in the yard, Ryan stared at the pigpen. Forty carcasses rotted in the summer heat, stench thick enough to taste.

The loss would hurt. But Ryan Wallace would sooner lose everything than sell his soul.

Thunder rumbled as storm clouds gathered overhead.
###Chapter 485: The Dead Pig Scandal

"Get out! Who wants to do business with scum like you?" Ryan Wallace brandished a broom, his eyes blazing with fury.

The two men exchanged smirks. "Playing the saint? Who else would buy pigs dead from swine fever?" one sneered.

"Exactly!" the other chimed in. "Wait till midnight thieves take them—you won't get a single penny!"

A crowd of villagers gathered outside the courtyard, whispering among themselves.

"What's going on with the Wallace family?"
"Heard their pigs got the fever..."
"Tsk. What a loss."

Seeing the growing audience, the buyers turned vicious. "Fine! Let your pigs rot! See who dares come near then!"

Ryan's temple throbbed as he swung the broom. "You monsters! Profiting from this?"

The broom whistled through the air, sending the men scrambling. The villagers gasped—these were black-market meat buyers!

"Serves them right!"
"Scum deserve worse!" Several youths cheered.

Yet furtive glances flickered through the crowd. Someone muttered, "Dead pigs are still money..."

Panting, Ryan scanned the faces. He recognized that greed—tonight, thieves would come.

The buyers staggered up, bloodied. "Just wait! See how long you can guard them!"

Ryan sneered. "I'll burn them first!"

The crowd erupted.

"Such waste..."
"That's cash gone..."

Ryan's knuckles whitened around the broom. The real trouble had only begun.
###Chapter 486: Blazing Resolve

"Listen up, everyone!" Ryan Wallace stood before the pigpen, his voice booming loud enough to shatter the icicles hanging from the eaves.

He nudged a stiff, bluish-purple carcass with his boot. "These pigs died of plague three days ago. And I swear on the Wallace name—"

With a sharp tug, he ripped open his quilted jacket, revealing a pristine wool sweater underneath. The gathered villagers gasped—that garment alone could buy two pigs.

"For three generations, the Wallaces have raised hogs, but never once sold tainted meat!" Ryan grabbed a shovel leaning against the wall and slammed it into the frozen ground. "I'd rather lose everything than let this ruin harm our neighbors!"

The crowd erupted. Several young men who worked at Ryan's diner pushed forward first. "Ryan, what's the plan?"

Wiping his face, Ryan pulled out a pack of Hongtashan cigarettes and passed them around. The cardboard box scraped against his numb fingers with a dry rustle.

"Pile them up. Burn them!"

Big Shuang was the first into the pen. The burly man hoisted a 200-pound carcass like it was a chicken, hurling it onto the open field. A dozen others joined in, and within half an hour, over forty dead pigs formed a grisly mound.

When Ryan's wife arrived with firewood, her legs trembled. These logs had been saved for New Year's rice cakes—now they would fuel the destruction of their livelihood.

"Douse it!" Ryan's veins bulged as he upended a vat of cooking oil. Golden streams arced through the air, splattering the pile with pungent droplets.

The moment the match struck, all of Six Paths Village seemed to hold its breath.

WHOOSH—

Flames roared three meters high, the heat forcing spectators back. The stench of burning bristle mixed with rendered fat made several women cover their noses. Sparks crackled skyward as if determined to punch holes through the leaden clouds.

At the crowd's rear, two pork buyers stood with faces paler than the three-day-old carcasses. The one in a fur cap suddenly rushed forward and seized Ryan's hand. "Wallace, you're a real man!"

Firelight carved Ryan's face into stark halves—one illuminated, the other shadowed. He shook off the man's grip and shoved a wad of bills at his wife. "Tomorrow, buy five pounds of good meat for every family that helped today."

The square exploded. In these times, who could afford meat outside holidays? Let alone receive it freely!

The blaze burned well past midnight. As someone sifted through the ashes, a cry rang out: "The—the inspection tags! They're still on the ears!" A silver metal ring gleamed under the moon, its embossed quarantine seal unmistakable.

Ryan kicked a charred skull, his laugh more bitter than the cold. "What's the point now?" He turned toward home, snow crunching under his boots. "At least my conscience is clear."

At dawn, a black sedan parked at the village entrance. The county livestock director in a wool overcoat pumped Ryan's hand vigorously. "Wallace, that fire of yours showed the backbone of every rancher in this county!"
###Chapter 487: Firecrackers and Heartache

Ryan Wallace rushed back to the county town as dusk approached. The sharp scent of disinfectant hit him the moment he stepped into the hospital corridor. He quickened his pace, heading straight for the doctor's office.

"Dr. Miller, how's my father—"

The bespectacled chief physician adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Cerebral thrombosis. Not critical, but he'll need annual IV treatments. Must avoid emotional distress."

Ryan froze mid-step when he pushed open the ward door. Laura Taylor stood arms akimbo by the bed, her husband Zachary Dawson hanging his head in the corner while Eleanor Wallace sat grim-faced in the shadows. Luna was conspicuously absent.

"Dad!" Ryan hurried forward, grasping his father's trembling hand. The age-spotted skin felt alarmingly cold.

Walter Wallace's clouded eyes suddenly brightened. "Rock..."

"Don't speak." Ryan gently patted the frail hand. "Just rest. What would you like to eat? I'll get it."

The old man shook his head, gaze darting toward the doorway. Understanding, Ryan explained, "Luna's managing the diner, and the kids have school. She sent twenty thousand dollars—said to ask for more if needed."

Eleanor snorted. "Such charity!"

"Mother!" Ryan's voice spiked before he forced it down. "We can't upset him now."

As the heart monitor's alarm subsided, Walter closed his eyes, a tear escaping. Ryan moistened a cotton swab to dab his father's cracked lips.

Outside, firecrackers suddenly erupted—too early for New Year's, likely some wedding celebration. Walter's eyes flew open, locking onto the window with unnatural intensity.

Ryan's heart twisted like wrung cloth.
###Chapter 488: Unresolved Grudges

"Fine! I'm lying here sick in bed, and you're still defending her! You've forgotten your own mother after getting married!" Old Man Wallace pounded the hospital bed in fury, causing the IV tube to sway violently.

His clouded eyes bulged as if he might throw off the blankets and storm out any second.

"Dad!" Ryan Wallace gripped his father's veined wrist.

"If you despise us this much, I'll leave now. Wouldn't want to give you a heart attack and have the whole village branding me unfilial." Ryan's chest heaved, his nails digging crescent moons into his palms.

He couldn't fathom why his father still harbored such hatred toward Luna after all these years.

"You—you—" The old man's trembling finger pointed at the door. "You came here to kill me, didn't you?"

Ryan turned on his heel and slammed the door hard enough to rattle the walls.

Only the old man's labored breathing filled the room. His wife patted his back soothingly. "You old fool! Our son finally visits, and you drive him away? Luna's given him a child—what more do you want?"

The fight drained from Old Man Wallace as he collapsed against the pillows in silence.

True... There was a grandchild now. What could he do?

On the hallway bench, Ryan scrubbed his face roughly. These family conflicts gave him migraines. Had his father not stirred trouble, they wouldn't be in this mess.

Luna was perfect—gentle, devoted, loving his three stepsons as her own. And then there was...

The image of their rosy-cheeked toddler surfaced—that tiny voice calling "Daddy," those chubby arms clinging to his neck. His lips curved involuntarily.

"Big bro." Ethan sidled onto the bench. "You know Dad's temper. Don't take it to heart."

Ryan shook his head. "I know."

"So... go back in? Mom says he regrets it already." Ethan rubbed his hands. "About the medical bills..."

"Let's go." Ryan straightened his collar. At the door, he caught his father's long, weary sigh from within.
###Chapter 489 The Family Division Dispute

"Dad, look at how stubborn you're being!" Ryan Wallace chuckled as soon as he stepped inside, seeing the old man's back turned to the door.

The old man's obstinacy made him seem like a petulant child throwing a tantrum.

Ryan pulled up a chair beside the bed and absentmindedly tucked the blanket tighter around his father.

"You need to focus on getting better. Let me tell you, your little granddaughter is an absolute delight—soft and rosy-cheeked, just like a little dumpling." Ryan took out his phone and flipped to a picture of his daughter. "Look at those big eyes. She's definitely got the Wallace genes."

"Hmph!" The old man abruptly turned his head away. "What's so special about a girl?"

Eleanor Wallace promptly smacked her husband on the back.

"You old fool!" She snatched the phone from Ryan, caressing the screen with tender affection. "Oh, my precious darling, how Grandma has missed you!"

Ryan stood up with a smile. "Little brother, let's go grab some food. Dad can only eat soft things right now—I'll make him some broth."

Just as Ethan was about to follow, his wife, Laura, pinched him hard on the arm.

"Ow!" Ethan winced but didn't dare protest, slinking out the door after his older brother.

Laura stomped her foot in frustration. That spineless coward—couldn’t even speak up when it mattered!

Eleanor watched her younger daughter-in-law's reaction with clear understanding. This family—it was time for a division.

"Old man," Eleanor said, wringing out a warm towel to wipe her husband’s face, "once you're fully recovered, let's go stay with Ryan in the city for a while. As for the house and land here, we should divide them among the children sooner rather than later."

The old man's eyes flew open. "Divide the family?"

"Yes," Eleanor sighed. "The children are all grown now, with their own lives and plans. At our age, we shouldn’t stand in their way."

The old man stared at the ceiling, his chest rising and falling rapidly, but said nothing.

Eleanor patiently wiped his hands. "Ethan lost money raising pigs, but haven’t Ryan and the others made something of themselves out there? As they say, every generation must find its own path."

The old man let out a heavy grunt and turned away again.

Eleanor wasn’t bothered. After spending time in the city, she had come to understand what a peaceful life truly meant. Ryan and his wife treated each other with respect—that kind of harmony mattered far more than first or second marriages ever could.

She had a feeling that once the old man laid eyes on that rosy-cheeked little granddaughter of theirs, all his resentment would melt away. That child was pure sunshine.

As for dividing the family—better now than later. Before the brothers turned against each other, it was best to settle everything cleanly. After that, they could each go their own way in peace.

Eleanor gazed out the window at the falling leaves and sighed softly. A family was like a great tree—sooner or later, its branches had to spread apart.
###Chapter 490: The Elderly Care Dispute

Chunyan bit her lower lip hard and grabbed Ernius's sleeve. "Wait for me!"

Ernius stomped his foot impatiently. "I'm just getting food—why are you following me? Mom's alone in the ward!"

"Brother!" Chunyan shook off his hand, her voice trembling. "I have something to say!"

Ernius's face darkened. "Shut up!" He reached out to pull her back.

With a sharp smack, Chunyan slapped his hand away. "You won't say anything, and now you won't let me speak either? This is unbearable!"

Ryan's gaze shifted between them before he gestured to a bench in the garden. "Sit down, sister-in-law. Let's talk."

"Brother, don't listen to her nonsense!" Ernius rubbed his hands anxiously.

Chunyan's eyes were red-rimmed. "Brother, with Dad in this condition, we need to settle the matter of elderly care. Ernius insists on closing our clothing shop in town and moving back to the village to take care of them, but we worked so hard to establish ourselves there..."

Her voice grew more agitated. "It's not that I'm unfilial, but why should we be the ones to give up everything when you're the eldest son? We have our own lives too!"

Ryan listened, then suddenly chuckled.

"You two..." He shook his head. "Ernius, why didn't you talk to me sooner?"

Ernius kept his head down, silent.

"I was already planning to bring Mom and Dad to the city," Ryan said, patting his brother's shoulder. "If Dad stays in the village, he'll just obsess over raising pigs again. The risks are too high now—his old methods won't work anymore."

Chunyan froze.

"Keep running your shop and build your life in town," Ryan said gently. "I'll handle the elderly care. You don't need to worry."

With that, he turned and walked toward the cafeteria.

Ernius shot Chunyan a glare, but she remained rooted in place, stunned. It took her a moment to process what had just happened. She never expected her usually stern brother-in-law to be so understanding.
###Chapter 491: The Family Division

The morning mist still clung to the ground when Old Man Wallace was discharged from the hospital. Leaning on his cane, he stood at the hospital entrance and took a deep breath of the fresh air he'd missed for so long.

"Dad, the car's here," Ryan Wallace said, helping his father into the minivan.

The second son's family had closed their shop early to wait at the village entrance. When they spotted the approaching vehicle, Laura Taylor nudged her husband. "They're here!"

As soon as the old man stepped into the courtyard, he saw the tables and chairs already set up. He gave a satisfied nod. "Go call the third son too."

Sean Wallace was working in the fields when he heard about the family meeting. He rushed back without even putting down his hoe.

"The mayor's here!" someone shouted. George Clark strode into the yard with several village council members.

Ryan's stomach dropped. Why had they invited the officials?

"Everyone, sit," Old Man Wallace cleared his throat. "I've gathered you today to discuss dividing the family property."

"Dividing?!" The teacup nearly slipped from Darren Wallace's hands.

Laura pinched her own arm hard enough to wince—this wasn't a dream.

Even Mayor Clark looked stunned. Everyone knew Old Man Wallace ruled the family with absolute authority. Why would he propose this now?

"Branches grow apart as trees age, just as families must eventually divide." The old man squinted. "You've all started your own households. It's time."

Darren rubbed his hands anxiously. "Dad, this—"

"Let me finish." The old man waved him off. "Twelve rooms—three for each son. The farmland goes to Sean. If he won't work it, rent it out."

Sean's eyes lit up.

"The savings will be split five ways." The old man paused. "Ryan's had it hardest all these years. He gets an extra share."

Ryan's head jerked up, his eyes reddening.

"Speak now if you object." The old man scanned the crowd. "After today, anyone who makes trouble will answer to me."

The courtyard fell silent.

"Then it's settled." The old man turned to Mayor Clark. "Would you draft the division agreement?"

Ryan's hand trembled as he signed. He stole a glance at his father and noticed the old man's hunched back seemed more pronounced.

After the division, Old Man Wallace sat alone in the main hall, smoking. Wreathed in tobacco haze, he exhaled deeply.

Outside, the three brothers exchanged uneasy looks. From today onward, each would shoulder his own household's burdens.


###Chapter 492: Brothers' Discussion

On the first night after the family division, Ryan Wallace gathered his two younger brothers and parents in the main room. Under the flickering light of a kerosene lamp, he rubbed his hands together and finally voiced the decision he had been contemplating for a long time: "Dad, Mom, I want to bring you to the provincial capital for the New Year."

Old Walter frowned immediately. "No!" He knocked his pipe heavily against the table. "I still have my pride. We didn't treat Luna well before—why go now and invite humiliation?"

"Dad!" Ryan protested urgently. "Luna isn't like that. I promise, if you're uncomfortable there, I'll buy your return tickets immediately."

Old Walter narrowed his eyes and stayed silent. Truthfully, he was itching to go. The villagers all said Ryan had struck it rich in the city, but how? Could running a restaurant really make that much money? Unless...

"Brother," Erxi suddenly interjected, "do people in the provincial capital really love eating that much? Or is Sister-in-law's cooking just that good?"

Sanxi's wife, Laura, discreetly pinched her husband's arm. What kind of question was that?

Ryan couldn't help but laugh. "You're overthinking it. It's a legitimate business. Luna's cooking is good, but the real reason is our hard work."

The room fell silent. Old Walter stared at the flickering flame of the kerosene lamp, his heart in turmoil. He feared his son might be bullied by his wife in the city, yet he also worried the business might not be sustainable. A father's heart was never at ease.

"Brother..." Sanxi suddenly spoke, his voice trembling slightly. "Laura and I talked all night..."

Laura nervously twisted the hem of her shirt, her eyes fixed on the ground.

"Just say it," Ryan said impatiently. He hated hesitation.

Sanxi clenched his teeth. "We want to go with you to the city and work! We can't handle pig farming, but we can do manual labor—no problem!"

Ryan was taken aback. He hadn't expected this from his younger brother. The restaurant was indeed short-handed, but...

"I need to discuss this with Luna first," Ryan said honestly. "We make decisions together about the business. For now, wait here. I'll call you after I talk to her."

Sanxi nodded eagerly, and Laura exhaled in relief. They didn't mind waiting—they just feared an outright rejection.

But Ryan's heart grew heavy. Inviting his parents had already been his own decision. If he added his younger brother and sister-in-law to the mix... would Luna think he was pushing his luck?

Yet, seeing his mother constantly murmuring about little Tangyuan, he couldn't bear to leave his parents solely in his brothers' care. Family was family—this was no easy choice.

The kerosene lamp let out a soft pop as the wick sparked. Old Walter suddenly stood. "Enough. Everyone, get some rest." He walked toward the door, hands behind his back, then paused. "When you buy the tickets... get me a lower berth."

Ryan's eyes lit up. His father had agreed!

The night wind swept through the main room, making the lamp flicker. Watching his father's hunched figure retreat, Ryan felt both joy and unease. With the whole family heading to the city... would Luna accept them?
###Chapter 493: Train Troubles

When George Clark heard they were leaving, he hurried over cheerfully. His daughter Lily was in the provincial capital and could travel with Ryan Wallace and his wife. Though Old Man Wallace was as stubborn as a mule, Ryan was Luna White's brother-in-law. Rumor had it Lily's rented storefront actually belonged to Luna's sister—that was quite the connection.

Ryan efficiently purchased five train tickets.

The group boarded the train in high spirits.

Old Man Wallace, experiencing his first train ride, kept glancing around while pretending to be worldly. It was downright comical.

Old Mrs. Wallace, however, knew the drill. She lay down on her bunk and dozed off immediately.

This infuriated her husband. Couldn't she have given him a heads-up? Now he was too embarrassed to ask questions. He'd assumed trains were like buses—you sat all the way to the destination. Who knew you could sleep lying down?

His shock only grew when Ryan returned with hot water. What else did this train have?

The old man's eyes widened. Suddenly, he clutched his stomach, face turning crimson.

He needed the restroom but couldn't find it anywhere. His wife had slipped out earlier, acting mysterious when questioned.

Pacing the aisle anxiously, he caught Ryan's attention. "Dad, what are you looking for?"

Food and drinks were already on the table.

From the middle bunk, George and Clara Clark paused their sightseeing to watch.

The old man stammered, "When's the next stop? I need to... relieve myself..."

Ryan chuckled. "Dad, trains have toilets. No need to wait." He helped his father up.

George quickly turned back to the window, shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.

Mrs. Wallace burst out laughing.

Mortified, the old man followed his son, discovering a clean metal stall—far nicer than their outhouse at home.

Once they left, the compartment erupted in amusement.

Wiping tears, Mrs. Wallace said, "That old fool—too proud for his own good."

George grinned. "If not for your guidance, we'd be the ones embarrassed."

Clara marveled, "This train is so advanced. I heard there's even a dining car."

George recalled the stuffy military transports from his youth—nothing like this.

When the old man returned to everyone's poorly hidden grins, he glared. This promised to be an eventful journey.
###Chapter 494: Simplicity

Luna White held Andrew Smith's arm as they returned to the Smith residence, their hands full of shopping bags. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground.

"Tired?" Andrew asked softly, giving her palm a gentle squeeze.

Luna shook her head with a faint smile. "Just these health supplements for your parents are a bit heavy."

They had agreed to only bring essentials for the family, saving other purchases for when they returned to Yun Province. Traveling long distances with too much luggage was inconvenient and risked damage.

As they stepped into the living room, they found Mrs. Wei sitting primly on the sofa. A polite smile graced her lips, but a trace of unease flickered in her eyes.

"Andrew, Luna, come sit," she greeted warmly, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her teacup.

Andrew guided Luna to the couch, immediately noticing his stepmother's tension.

Mrs. Wei was mentally tallying wedding expenses. Between Andrew's military comrades, friends, and relatives from both families, they'd need at least twenty tables—not accounting for last-minute guests. She bit her lip, strategizing how to maintain propriety while cutting costs.

"Auntie, you seem pale. Are you feeling unwell?" Luna asked with concern.

Mrs. Wei forced a brighter smile. "Just wedding planning." She hesitated. "I thought we'd hold it at the First Dining Hall. It's not as grand as the Third, but more budget-friendly—"

Andrew cut in cheerfully, "Whatever you arrange is fine, Auntie. Luna and I don't care about pomp."

Luna nodded. "Simple is perfect."

Mrs. Wei exhaled discreetly, her smile turning genuine. "Then the invitations—"

"We'll handle those," Andrew interjected, his gaze softening at Luna. They'd already shared their most meaningful vows during their border ceremony—no banquet could compare.

The moment shattered as Andrew's elder brother barged in. "Hold on! My little brother deserves a proper wedding!" Arms akimbo, he fixed Mrs. Wei with a challenging stare. "I'm overseeing this."

Mrs. Wei's smile froze, her teacup trembling slightly.
###Chapter 495: Starving

The moment Luna White saw Andrew Smith's elder brother, a throbbing headache assaulted her. This man was nothing but trouble.

Since his arrival, the entire household had been walking on eggshells.

Andrew's brother wouldn't tolerate his younger sibling having a shabby wedding. Though their father constantly preached frugality, such notions held no weight with him.

He snatched the wedding checklist from the table.

Luna forced a strained smile at Andrew and his mother. What could she possibly say?

"The community canteen?!" His outburst made Luna tug at Andrew's sleeve. After a full day of shopping, she had no energy left for this argument.

Andrew glanced at his wife, noticing the dark circles under her eyes. "Brother," he said, turning to his sibling, "we're going upstairs to change. You and Mother can decide—we have no objections."

Without waiting for a reply, he led Luna upstairs.

The moment they entered their room, Luna collapsed onto the bed.

She'd walked more today than in an entire month. Her feet burned, and her stomach growled angrily. Having forgotten her food stamps, she'd passed countless eateries with nothing but longing glances.

Andrew set down their shopping bags and fetched her slippers. "Take a shower first. I'll get you something to eat."

Guilt pricked at Luna. She needed to step up as a wife instead of always relying on Andrew's care.

Under the hot shower, fatigue melted away. Rubbing her sore ankles, she resolved to break this bad habit.

"Noodles are ready," Andrew called through the door.

Luna emerged, drying her hair, to find a steaming bowl on the table. Clear broth with spring onions and two golden fried eggs looked irresistibly inviting.

"Aren't you eating?" she asked.

Andrew took the towel to dry her hair. "I ate downstairs. Dig in, little glutton."

Luna eagerly grabbed her chopsticks. The first bite made her close her eyes in bliss.

Watching her devour the food, Andrew couldn't help but chuckle.
###Chapter 496: Andrew's Tenderness

"Still hurting?" Andrew's voice carried cautious concern.

Luna suppressed a giggle, deliberately drawing out her words. "My foot~" She blinked up at him like a mischievous fox.

The tips of Andrew's ears turned pink, but his hands gentled their massage. Suddenly serious, he murmured, "Luna... what kind of wedding do you want?" Guilt laced his tone.

She froze. The question caught her off guard.

"Andrew..."

"Hmm?" His fingers stilled, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Don't stop~" Luna squirmed like a pampered cat. "Who knew Colonel Smith had such skills? Confess—who else have you practiced on?"

Andrew's low chuckle warmed her neck. "Only you." His fingers combed through her hair. "I'm completely yours."

Her heart bubbled with sweetness, though she teased, "You'd better not serve anyone else!"

"What did you call me earlier?" His voice roughened.

Luna's eyes sparkled. "Andrew! It'd be strange to keep using your full name." She counted on her fingers. "'Drew' is too plain, 'hubby' too cheesy—"

"I like it." He interrupted, tenderness dripping from his words. "Any name from your lips is perfect."

Raised voices erupted downstairs. Luna perked up. "Your brother arguing with your stepmother again?"

Honestly, the eldest Smith son—pushing thirty yet constantly feuding with his stepmother. This wasn't some melodrama; what grown man held such grudges?

Andrew sighed. "That's just how he treats her." His fingers resumed their soothing strokes. "He's generous with everyone else."

"What exactly did your stepmother do?" Luna turned curiously. "She seems perfectly kind to your younger brother."

With another sigh, he guided her back into position. "She... was pregnant once."

Luna's ears practically twitched.

"Probably saw my brother as an obstacle." His tone remained even, though his hands tightened slightly. "Then... she lost the baby. Permanently."

She inhaled sharply.

"Now she pours everything into my youngest brother." Andrew massaged her temples. "That's our family's story."

Luna clasped his hand. Their fingers intertwined in silent understanding.

As the quarreling faded below, night embraced the military compound.
###Chapter 497: Andrew's True Nature

"Your stepmother's methods are too clumsy," Luna twirled a strand of hair around her finger, lips pursed in disapproval. "If it were me, I wouldn't be so foolish."

Andrew arched an eyebrow, the towel draped casually over his shoulder. "Oh? What would you do instead?"

"Pamper you into ruin, of course!" Her eyes sparkled like a cunning little fox. "Spoil all three brothers rotten until you become good-for-nothing playboys. Meanwhile, I'd raise my own child to be exceptional. Effortless reputation-building."

A low chuckle rumbled in Andrew's throat, the sound curling around her heart like a feather's caress.

"What's so funny?" Luna glared. "Think I'm too devious?"

"On the contrary, it's brilliant." He leaned closer, the contours of his muscles visible beneath his military shirt. "I'd do the same in your position."

Luna nearly slid off the bed. This man—all chiseled jawline and righteous demeanor—was saying such things with perfect composure.

"Scared?" His hand steadied her.

"Not at all!" She righted herself. "Just didn't expect this side of Colonel Smith. Quite the character deviation."

Andrew's gaze burned intense. "This is the real me, Luna. Does it... frighten you?"

No more masks between them. Marriage demanded raw honesty.

Suddenly, Luna laughed. She draped an arm over his shoulder, feline eyes gleaming. "Better this way. If you stayed perpetually perfect, I'd never dare misbehave." Quick as lightning, she pecked the corner of his mouth.

Andrew's expression softened. "Lie down," he murmured. "Let me massage you."

She obeyed, wincing when his palms met her sore calves.

"Relax." His fingers worked with precision, kneading upward from her ankles with perfect pressure.

Gradually, Luna's tension melted. His technique was professional, each movement targeting exact pressure points. Pleasure coaxed kittenish whimpers from her throat.

"Stop..." Her cheeks flamed, trying to stifle the embarrassing sounds.

But drowsiness overpowered her. Under his ministrations, she purred like a contented cat, eyelids growing heavy until they finally closed.
###Chapter 498: Petty Tricks

He gazed down at her, the corners of his lips curling into a doting smile.

She was asleep.

Deeply, peacefully, utterly defenseless in slumber.

Her raven-black hair fanned across the pillow, thick lashes casting delicate shadows under the lamplight. Her slightly parted pink lips exhaled steady, even breaths.

The soft whimpers she'd made during his massage had tightened his throat. Those sounds—so unbearably enticing—flooded him with memories of last night's intimacy.

With a quiet sigh, he tucked the blanket around her. Luna shifted like a drowsy kitten, nuzzling unconsciously against the pillow before settling again.

Andrew's Adam's apple bobbed as his long fingers began undoing his shirt buttons. A cold shower seemed necessary.

"Mmm..." She murmured incoherently, rolling onto her side.

He chuckled under his breath and quietly shut the door. Let her rest—after last night...

Downstairs, Clara's shrill voice pierced the air: "What's the meaning of this, Andrew? Are you punishing me over that incident?"

"You know our family's situation!" Her voice escalated. "Your father's meager salary barely covers his comrades' needs—"

Andrew paused at the stairwell, dinner tray in hand, brow furrowing.

"If finances are so strained," Nathaniel's voice cut like ice, "I'll handle my brother's wedding expenses as the eldest."

"You—!" Clara's voice trembled with rage.

"What's going on here?" John's sudden interjection made Andrew halt mid-step.

Before he could descend, Kevin's voice came from behind: "Brother? What are you doing?"

Kevin's eyes locked onto the tray, his expression darkening. "You're serving that woman?"

"Andrew!" Kevin grabbed his arm. "Since when do men wait on women? If word gets out—"

Andrew shook him off with icy precision.

"My wife. My rules." The casual declaration carried steel.

Kevin gaped as if uncovering some scandal. "I'm telling Father! This is—"

Andrew strode downstairs without a backward glance, a cold smirk playing on his lips.

Pathetic.

###Chapter 499: No Objections

"Luna is my wife, not our mother," Andrew Smith said coldly as he descended the stairs, his military boots thudding heavily against the wooden floorboards. "A man taking care of his woman is only natural. You're not married yet—you wouldn't understand."

Joseph Smith flushed with anger. "Second Brother, you're spoiling her too much! What kind of wife expects her husband to bring meals to her room?"

"What kind of wife is like Luna?" Andrew whirled around, his gaze sharp as a blade. "She charged through a minefield without blinking. If I want to spoil her, that's my right."

Joseph choked on his retort. The memory of his last punishment from Andrew made his back ache faintly.

"Let me make this clear," Andrew stepped closer, his voice dangerously low. "You will show her respect. Or else—"

Joseph shrank back. He knew his brother never made empty threats.

The aroma of food drifted from the kitchen. Andrew turned away to serve the meal, leaving his younger brother standing dumbfounded.

Joseph suddenly thought of Rain Johnson—the girl who had always trailed after Andrew but never spared him a glance. If Rain had married him... would he have doted on her like this?

"Joseph!" Old Man Smith's roar snapped him out of his thoughts.

In the living room, the patriarch slammed his palm on the table. "The wedding will be held at the community canteen—twenty tables, simple and efficient!"

Andrew emerged from the kitchen carrying a tray, his expression calm. "Father, I have no objections."

"Andrew!" Ethan Smith shot to his feet. "You're just letting them—"

"Ethan!" Old Man Smith barked. "Mind your own household! Get out of here before you cause more trouble!"

Ethan stormed out, the door slamming hard enough to rattle the windows.

Andrew didn't even glance up as he carefully carried the tray upstairs. Luna was waiting for him.


###Chapter 500: An Unwelcome Visitor

Andrew Smith returned home with a dark expression, slamming his briefcase onto the sofa the moment he stepped inside. His wife, Clara, peeked out from the kitchen at the commotion before silently retreating.

"Another unpleasant visit to the Smith family?" Clara asked calmly, handing him a cup of hot tea.

Andrew accepted the cup and sighed heavily. "The old man's favoritism is nothing new."

Clara didn't respond. She knew her husband too well—a decisive man at work, yet hopelessly tangled when it came to family matters. Over the years, she had learned to let it go. After all, he was the one choosing to endure the frustration.

Just then, the phone rang abruptly. Andrew answered—it was his brother, Andrew Jr. After a ten-minute conversation, the gloom on his face vanished completely.

"What's got you so happy?" Clara asked curiously.

Andrew grinned mysteriously and suddenly swept her into his arms, spinning her around. "That's a secret!"

"Put me down!" Clara laughed, playfully hitting his shoulders. This stern-faced man only ever showed such childish affection when they were alone.

Night deepened, and the bedroom lights soon went out, leaving only the moonlight streaming through the window.

The next day, wedding invitations from the Smith family were sent out like snowflakes. Luna White and Andrew Jr. sat in the living room reviewing the guest list, both dressed in crisp military uniforms—their chosen attire for the ceremony.

"This is perfect—dignified and sharp," Luna said, adjusting her collar with satisfaction. "Much better than those gaudy red outfits."

Andrew Jr. nodded, his gaze tender as he watched his bride. Then, the doorbell rang.

The moment he opened the door, his smile froze. Rain Johnson stood on the doorstep, her eyes swollen like peaches, clearly having cried the entire way there.

"Andrew..." Rain sobbed, lunging toward him.

Andrew swiftly sidestepped, his brow furrowing. "Rain, control yourself."

"Control myself?" Her voice rose sharply. "After all these years waiting for you, this is how you treat me?" Her glare shifted past him, landing venomously on Luna in the living room. "What makes her so special?"

Luna set down the guest list and walked calmly to Andrew's side. They stood shoulder to shoulder, their military insignias gleaming under the light.

"Rain," Andrew said firmly, "I've only ever seen you as a sister. Now, please leave."

Rain's face paled instantly. Her lips parted, but no words came out. The air in the room thickened, as if time itself had stopped.
