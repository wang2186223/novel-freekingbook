###Chapter 1

Evelyn Carter was pregnant.

The test results crumpled slightly in her trembling fingers as she walked home, heart pounding with excitement. She couldn't wait to surprise her husband, Daniel Blackwood, when he returned from his overseas business trip tomorrow. He'd been gone for nearly three weeks.

But the moment she stepped inside their home, her joy evaporated.

A pair of designer heels—ones she didn’t own—sat neatly by the foyer.

Her stomach twisted.

She recognized them instantly. They belonged to her half-sister, Serena Hart.

Wasn’t Serena supposed to be on the same trip with Daniel?

Then, a woman’s voice drifted down from upstairs—breathy, intimate.

Serena’s voice.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Who else could be up there with her?

Her legs moved before her mind could stop her. Each step up the staircase made the voices clearer—Serena’s teasing purr, a man’s deep, indifferent tone.

Daniel’s voice.

“What happens when she finds out?” Serena murmured.

“I don’t care.” His reply was ice-cold.

“She’s been desperate for your baby. But I got pregnant first. How will you explain that to her?”

“I said I don’t care.”

Evelyn’s blood turned to frost.

Her fingers hovered over the doorknob—then she pulled back.

What was the point?

Daniel had never loved her.

She had been the one who fought for this marriage.

For two years, she’d visited every fertility specialist, tried every remedy, just to give him a child.

And now, when she finally carried his baby, he was in their bed with Serena—who was also pregnant.

Tears burned her cheeks as she stumbled out of the house. The rain poured, soaking her through, but she barely felt it.

No wonder Daniel insisted Serena be his assistant. No wonder he took her on every business trip.

They’d been together all along.

Upstairs, Serena smirked as she watched Evelyn’s retreating figure through the window.

The man’s voice Evelyn had heard? A cleverly edited recording. Serena knew her sister wouldn’t dare open that door.

“My wife is Evelyn. Have some self-respect.”

“I’m not getting divorced anytime soon.”

Daniel’s brutal rejection still echoed in her ears.

With a cold laugh, Serena pulled out her phone and dialed.

Evelyn didn’t realize how far she’d walked until she stood on Harborview Bridge, rain blurring her vision.

A truck roared toward her.

She didn’t move.

CRASH.

The impact sent her flying. Pain exploded through her body as she hit the pavement, blood streaming from her temple.

Through the haze, she saw the driver step out. He checked her pulse, then made a call.

“Mr. Blackwood… She’s still alive. Should I finish the job?”

Her heart shattered.

Mr. Blackwood.

There was only one man that could be—Daniel.

The man she’d loved with everything. The man who’d just ordered her death.

Was this because she’d discovered his affair?

Or… because he wanted to legitimize Serena’s baby instead of hers?

“Don’t blame me,” the driver sneered. “Blame yourself for loving the wrong man.”

A brutal kick sent her sliding toward the edge.

Another.

Then—

Nothing but air.

As she fell, Daniel’s face flashed in her mind—the boy she’d met under the cherry blossoms, beautiful and kind.

“I hate you, Daniel Blackwood…”

Six Years Later

Mariner’s Cove.

Daniel strode out of a board meeting, his expression unreadable. His assistant rushed to his side, pale.

“Sir—it’s your wife. There’s been an accident.”

He didn’t slow. “What now?”

“She… She was hit by a truck. They haven’t recovered her body.”

Daniel froze.

His phone rang—the hospital.

“Mr. Blackwood, your wife didn’t want you to know, but… she was three months pregnant.”

Willowbrook International Airport

A woman in a sleek black trench coat stepped off the plane, her chestnut hair cascading over her shoulders.

Six years ago, she was Evelyn Carter.

Now, she was just Evelyn.

Behind her, two children—a boy and a girl—mirrored her cold elegance, their small suitcases rolling behind them.

“Evelyn!”

Grace Thornton waved from the arrivals gate. The renowned plastic surgeon had met Evelyn during her studies abroad and become her closest friend.

Grace grabbed her luggage, grinning. “Everything’s ready at the house!”

Evelyn smiled faintly. “Liam, Emily, this is your Aunt Grace.”

“Hi, Auntie!” Emily blew a kiss.

Liam merely eyed Grace. “You’re single, right?”

Grace blinked. “How’d you—?”

He yanked the suitcase from her hands. “Women who work too hard stay single.”

Grace gaped.

Evelyn sighed. “He means he doesn’t want you to tire yourself.”

Grace huffed. “That’s better.”

Looping arms with Evelyn, she whispered, “Why come back now? And where’s Oliver?”
###Chapter 2

The mention of her eldest son made Evelyn's chest tighten.

She forced a bitter smile. "He's being taken care of back there. We might extend our stay this time."

There were things she needed to settle.

Six years ago, Daniel and Serena had conspired to kill her—even when she was three months pregnant. After her "death" was announced, Serena had the audacity to produce a forged will, claiming Evelyn had taken her own life out of guilt for betraying Daniel.

Ludicrous.

The real traitors lived in bliss while she bore the stigma of infidelity even in death. For everything they stole from her, she would make them bleed.

And then there was Oliver's body...

Evelyn exhaled sharply before turning to Grace. "What about the job opening I asked you to look into?"

Grace hesitated. "I made inquiries, but currently, the only position available at Blackwood Group is..."

"A janitor."

Evelyn's lips curved. "Then I'll be a janitor."

"You can't be serious." Grace knew exactly what Evelyn had endured.

Six years ago, after the accident, she had clawed her way back from the brink. She waited until her children were born before undergoing reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, rebuilding herself from the ground up.

She became a celebrated jewelry designer in Europe—only to abruptly retire and return to Willowbrook under her real name.

And now she wanted to scrub floors at Blackwood Group?

"There are plenty of suitable jobs for you in Willowbrook besides—"

Evelyn shook her head. "Only Blackwood Group."

The apartment Grace secured for her belonged to a relative—spacious, with three bedrooms, conveniently close to downtown.

Evelyn and her two children spent hours cleaning and arranging their new home.

"Liam, watch your sister. I'm going out for supplies."

"Got it!"

The moment the door closed, the children rushed to the laptop, pulling up an interview with Daniel.

"Liam, is that Daddy?" Sophia hugged her teddy bear, biting her lip. "You're right. Out of the three of us, he looks most like you."

"Yeah." Liam studied the man on screen, eyes narrowing. "Remember what I taught you?"

Sophia nodded, tiny fists clenched. Her sweet voice turned solemn. "I'll give the performance of a lifetime."

Outside, Evelyn hailed a cab to the nearest mall.

As she approached checkout, a familiar voice drifted from the store's screen:

"Everyone seems so invested in mine and Daniel's wedding plans."

Serena smiled graciously. "But we're both focused on our careers right now. There's simply no time for ceremonies."

The host chuckled. "Of course. After five years together, your bond speaks for itself."

Evelyn's grip on the cart turned white-knuckled.

Six years ago, their forged will had "requested" Daniel marry Serena and care for her forever. How noble. How convenient.

Even now, the betrayal burned. They stole her life, her name, while parading their love story for the world.

Lost in thought, her cart collided with someone.

"Sorry—" She looked up, and the apology died in her throat.

The man before her was tall, striking, exuding icy arrogance.

Six years had only sharpened his features, adding a ruthless maturity. Her fingers trembled against the cart.

Of all the ways to reunite—here, now.

Daniel's gaze swept over her, cold and dismissive. "Watch where you're going."

Her face, once ravaged by infection after the accident, had been meticulously rebuilt by Europe's finest surgeons. For two years, she'd stared at mirrors, convincing herself the reflection was truly hers.

"My apologies, Mr. Blackwood." She steadied her voice. "I was distracted by your fiancée's interview."

His brow arched. "You know me?"

"Who doesn't?" Evelyn smiled thinly. "The man who honored his late wife's dying wish by promising to care for her sister. Willowbrook's favorite love story."

Something flickered in his eyes. From a distance, her silhouette—her walk, the way she tucked her hair—had been identical to Evelyn's.

Close up, everything was wrong. The face, the voice, the sharpness. Evelyn had been soft, obedient. This woman was fire wrapped in silk.

"Daniel!" Serena's sugary voice cut through the tension. She fluttered to his side, linking their arms. "What's taking so long?"

"Nothing."

He turned away without another glance. "Got everything you needed?"

"Mm-hmm!"

Evelyn stood frozen as they walked off, ice spreading through her veins.

At home, she prepared an elaborate dinner, masking her turmoil with smiles. But Liam and Sophia noticed.

Afterwards, Liam retreated to his room, hacking into the mall's surveillance. His jaw tightened as he watched Daniel follow his mother before "accidentally" bumping into her.

So the bastard had brought his mistress shopping.

No wonder Mom came home so quiet.

He stormed into Sophia's room. "We start tomorrow."

Next morning, Evelyn called them to breakfast.

"Sophia stayed up late watching cartoons. Let her sleep," Liam said through a yawn. "Oh, didn't the post office call about our shipment?"

Evelyn nodded. "We'll go after breakfast."

"Just go now." Liam shoveled food into his mouth. "We're not babies."

With a sigh, she grabbed her coat and left. Sometimes, her six-year-olds acted more grown than she did.

The moment the door shut, Liam pulled up the surveillance feed, whispering into his phone:

"Sophia. Are you in position?"
###Chapter 3

The air at Pierce Corporation was thick with tension as employees stood in rigid formation, awaiting their formidable CEO's arrival.

At precisely 8 AM, a sleek black limousine pulled up to the entrance. A sharply dressed butler hurried from the passenger seat to open the rear door.

Daniel Blackwood stepped out, his tailored suit accentuating his imposing frame. His expression was ice-cold, his presence so commanding it made the surrounding employees hold their breath.

He strode toward the building without sparing anyone a glance.

"Daddy!"

A high-pitched, sugary voice shattered the tense silence. Heads snapped toward the sound.

A tiny figure in a frilly pink dress wobbled up the stairs, her golden curls bouncing with each step. Though her face was hidden, she carried herself with the same regal air as Daniel himself.

She latched onto his leg with tiny hands, barely reaching his knee.

"Daddy!" Sophia pouted, her big blue eyes shimmering with mischief. The crowd erupted in hushed whispers.

Daniel looked down at the pink-clad nuisance clinging to him, irritation flickering across his sharp features. "Release me."

She tilted her head up, revealing delicate features that mirrored his own—same strong jawline, same piercing gaze. The resemblance was uncanny.

"Sir, this child—" The butler gaped. "She looks just like you!"

"Daddy, up!" Sophia stretched her arms toward him, her innocent smile disarming.

Against his better judgment, Daniel felt something shift inside him. He despised children—yet this one inexplicably tugged at him.

After a beat of hesitation, he bent down, scooped her up, and marched inside. "Lock down the premises. I want answers."

A child this young couldn’t have gotten here alone.

"Mr. Blackwood, the DNA results."

Ethan Reynolds handed over the report with trembling hands. "She… is biologically yours."

Daniel snatched the document. 99.9% match.

His jaw tightened.

Aside from Evelyn, he had never been with another woman.

His gaze snapped to Sophia, who sat cross-legged on his office sofa, happily munching on gummy bears as if she owned the place.

He approached her, his voice uncharacteristically soft. "What's your name?"

"Princess Sophia!"

"How old are you?"

She grinned, holding up five fingers. "Six!"

Daniel's blood ran cold.

Six years.

If Evelyn hadn’t died in that accident, their child would be six.

Had she survived?

His pulse quickened. He’d searched for years—dredged the ocean, scoured hospitals—but found nothing.

Yet here was this child, his flesh and blood, appearing out of nowhere.

"Where's your mother?" he demanded.

Sophia hesitated, then shook her head. "Don’t know!"

Daniel crouched to her eye level. "Good girls don’t lie."

She blinked innocently. "Someone told me lying is genetic. Daddy, are you a good boy?"

His expression darkened. "Who told you that?"

She pursed her lips. "Have you ever lied, Daddy?"

Ethan choked back a laugh. Daniel shot him a glare before turning back to Sophia. "Surveillance footage?"

"Compromised," Ethan admitted. "Our systems were hacked this morning. All recordings are corrupted."

Daniel’s grip tightened. A hacked security system and a mysterious child? No coincidence.

Sophia suddenly hopped up. "Daddy, I need a bath!"

"A bath? Now?"

She nodded vigorously. "And I pick who bathes me!"

Daniel exhaled sharply. "Ethan, take her to Silvercrest Manor. Let her choose a maid."

Ethan blinked. Since when did Daniel indulge anyone’s whims?

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter collapsed onto her couch, exhausted after hauling heavy boxes into their new apartment.

"Liam Carter!" she yelled. "What did you ship home?"

A small head peeked out from the bedroom. "Your design portfolios. In case you need them."

Evelyn groaned. She’d left her old life behind—why would she need those?

Her phone rang.

"Ms. Carter? You’ve been selected by our young miss. Report to Silvercrest Manor immediately."

Evelyn froze.

Silvercrest?

Daniel Blackwood’s estate?
###Chapter 4

"Yes, Silvercrest Manor. It belongs to Mr. Blackwood."

The man on the phone sounded exasperated. "The Little Princess needs someone to help her with her bath, and she specifically asked for you. Hurry up!"

The call ended abruptly.

Evelyn frowned, glancing at Liam standing before her. "This is the job you found for me?"

The boy nodded, taking her hand. "Mom, I know why you're back. Getting close to Daniel Blackwood at his home is easier than at his office, right?"

She sighed. These clever little devils always saw through her. Kneeling, she met his gaze. "You're right, but—"

"Don't worry!" Liam grinned, eyes bright. "The Little Princess is easy to handle!"

Evelyn smiled helplessly, washing her face and smoothing her clothes.

"Where’s Sophia?" she asked while slipping on her shoes.

Her youngest usually clung to her the moment she stepped inside. Why wasn’t she here now?

"Oh, she’s busy watching cartoons!" Liam assured. "I’ll take care of her. Go ahead."

Evelyn hesitated but left without another word.

Liam was right.

Working at Silvercrest Manor gave her better access to Daniel than his corporate office.

She couldn’t waste this chance.

Still…

Who was this "Little Princess"?

She’d researched Daniel thoroughly before returning to Willowbrook, but there’d been no mention of a child.

Lost in thought, Evelyn followed a servant into the manor.

Six years. She was back.

The sapling she’d planted in the garden now stood tall. The interior remained unchanged—the same vases, the same paintings, all pristine.

Her chest tightened as memories flooded in.

"Little Princess, she’s here!" A man’s weary voice interrupted her thoughts.

Evelyn turned—and froze.

There stood her daughter, dressed in a frilly pink gown, clutching a teddy bear.

Sophia?!

The little girl pressed a finger to her lips, signaling silence.

"This auntie is perfect," she chirped, skipping forward. "Hi, I’m Sophia!"

Evelyn’s voice dropped to a whisper. "What are you doing here?"

"I’ll explain later!" Sophia grabbed her hand. "Auntie, let’s go upstairs. I want a milk bath!"

She tugged Evelyn toward the staircase.

"Take good care of the Little Princess!"

Ethan sighed as the woman disappeared. The princess was more stubborn than her father. It had taken all afternoon to find a maid she approved of.

In the bathroom, Sophia lounged in the tub, pouting. "Mom, don’t be mad. Daddy’s actually nice to me. I’m fine."

Evelyn stroked her damp hair. "I need to make a call."

Sophia watched her leave, worry creasing her brow. Had she messed up?

"Liam." On the balcony, Evelyn gripped her phone. "Explain this."

His voice was sheepish. "You’ve met Sophia?"

"Why did you arrange for her to meet him?"

Her eldest was quiet, her middle child cunning, and Sophia obedient—but she never expected Liam to orchestrate this.

"Mom, it was bound to happen." He sighed. "I knew you’d be upset, but… Sophia looks just like him. Even if we hide her, his people will notice eventually."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened.

She hated admitting it, but Sophia had her father’s eyes—strikingly so.

"Since he’d find out anyway," Liam pressed, "we struck first. Now Sophia’s with him, he can’t marry that woman."

Evelyn shut her eyes. "And if he refuses to give her back? I raised you alone. I won’t lose—"

"Trust me." His voice turned solemn. "If you ever want her home, I’ll make sure she comes back."

She ended the call with a bitter laugh.

Liam was just a child. He didn’t understand Daniel.

Years ago, that man had sent her—his own wife—to die for Serena.

If he kept Sophia… She couldn’t bear the thought.

For now, she couldn’t reveal herself or take Sophia away. She had unfinished business.

She’d improvise.

Returning to the bathroom, she found Sophia already dressed, her small face anxious.

"Mom, you’re not mad, right?" she whispered. "Liam said… I could help you."

Evelyn’s heart melted. How could she stay angry?

She hugged her tightly. "I’m not mad. But remember—no calling me ‘Mom’ around others. If anything happens, come to me first, okay?"

"Okay!" Sophia squeezed her. "I’m your daughter forever. I won’t forget."

Evelyn blinked back tears.

"Sophia."

A deep voice echoed outside the door. "It’s Daddy. Are you done?"

Sophia glanced at Evelyn, who nodded.

"All done!" The little princess took a deep breath and sauntered out.

The door opened.

Daniel swept her into his arms, his embrace warm. Sophia nestled against his shoulder, sighing.

So this was a father’s hug.

She hoped Liam and Oliver could feel it too someday.

Maybe having a dad wasn’t so bad.

"Ethan said you hired a maid?" Daniel frowned.

"Mm-hmm." Sophia pointed toward the bathroom. "Auntie’s still inside. She’s really nice! You should be nice to her too, Daddy!"

Evelyn, scrubbing the sink, paused.

Why did it sound like… her daughter was playing matchmaker?
###Chapter 5

Daniel frowned and sent Sophia outside. "Ethan, take her for some dessert."

Once the door clicked shut, he stepped into the bathroom.

Even though he'd told Sophia she could choose her own nanny, she was still just a child—her judgment wasn't as sharp as an adult's. Worried, Daniel had made a point to come home early to check on things.

Inside the bathroom, Evelyn finished organizing the vanity and turned, noticing only white towels on the rack. She opened the cabinet, pulled out a pink one, and hung it up.

Sophia adored pink.

The room was thick with steam, and Evelyn moved through it with practiced ease, her slender figure weaving between the fixtures as she worked.

The sight of her, the way she moved—it made Daniel's chest tighten.

"Evie…" The name slipped out before he could stop it.

Evelyn froze.

After a beat, she turned, offering him a polite smile. "Hello, Mr. Blackwood."

Her unfamiliar face, her unfamiliar voice—it snapped him back to reality.

"You?"

The woman from the boutique last night.

Evelyn's smile remained steady. "Hello. I'm Evelyn."

His brows slashed down. "Your name."

"Evelyn."

"What?" His eyes narrowed.

A second later, his hand closed around her throat, slamming her against the cold tiles. "Are you telling me your last name is Carter? Evelyn Carter?"

His voice was ice. "You bumped into me on purpose yesterday. Now you're here as my daughter's nanny, using my wife's name? What kind of game are you playing?"

Evelyn couldn't speak, his grip cutting off her air.

She struggled, but inside, she laughed bitterly.

He still remembered she'd once been Evelyn Carter.

She’d assumed he would’ve forgotten her after all these years with Serena.

"Daddy!" The door burst open as Sophia rushed in, tiny hands tugging at his leg. "Stop! You're hurting her! If she's hurt, I'll be sad!"

Her voice trembled with anger and fear.

Daniel hesitated—then released her.

Evelyn collapsed to the floor, gasping, fingers pressed to her bruised throat.

"Are you okay?" Sophia dropped beside her, patting her back frantically. "Does it hurt? I'll call a doctor!"

She whirled on Daniel, glaring. "Go get a doctor!"

Ethan, standing nearby, broke into a cold sweat.

In Willowbrook, Daniel Blackwood was untouchable. Even the elders of the Blackwood family didn’t dare speak to him like this—yet this little girl, his daughter, treated him like a servant.

Daniel exhaled sharply, then glanced at Ethan. "Call a doctor."

Ethan blinked.

"No need."

Evelyn stood, steadying herself. "I don’t need a doctor for something this small."

She met Daniel’s gaze evenly. "Mr. Blackwood, my name is Evelyn. E-ve-lyn. I’m sorry if it reminds you of your ex-wife, but I can’t change that."

"As for the boutique—that was an accident."

She held his stare. "I needed a job I was good at. Your daughter and I connected. That’s all. I have no interest in you. Don’t flatter yourself."

Then, softening, she turned to Sophia. "I thought you went for dessert?"

Sophia pouted. "Too sweet. I don’t like it."

"Want cookies instead?"

"Yes!"

"I’ll bake you some."

"Okay!"

Sophia grabbed Evelyn’s hand and marched past Daniel, chin high.

At the door, she paused, glaring back at him. "Daddy, if you hurt Auntie again… I’ll run away. And call the police. I’ll tell them you’re mean!"

Daniel watched them go, jaw tight.

"Get me everything on Evelyn."

"Yes, sir." Ethan nodded, but Daniel stopped him.

"The way I acted just now…" He hesitated. "Did it make Sophia think I’m a bad person?"

This daughter, appearing out of nowhere, thrilled and baffled him. He was overjoyed to learn Evelyn might still be alive—that he had a child. But he had no idea how to be a father.

He’d only wanted answers. He hadn’t considered Sophia’s impression of him.

"A little," Ethan admitted, wiping his brow. "She picked Evelyn herself from dozens of candidates. She really likes her."

Daniel’s frown deepened. Annoyed, he stalked downstairs.

In the kitchenette, Sophia sat at the table, staring intently at the oven.

"What are you doing?"

"Waiting for my cookies." She licked her lips. "Auntie said thirty more minutes."

Daniel scanned the room. "Where is she?"

"Who?" Sophia tilted her head, big eyes blinking. "Auntie?"

At her innocent expression, he softened, ruffling her hair. "Yes. Her."

"Auntie’s…"

Sophia’s lip wobbled—then she burst into tears. "She left!"

Her sobs were theatrical. "She said you hate her! That even though she needs money, she won’t stay where she’s not wanted! So she went home! Waaaaah!"

Daniel stared.

She just… left?

He crouched, studying Sophia. "Do you want her back?"

"Yes!" She sniffled. "But she said unless you apologize and admit you were wrong, she won’t come back."

Then, with exaggerated solemnity, she added, "But Daddy’s pride is more important. So… you can cook for me instead. I only eat food made by people I love. And in this house, that’s just you."

A vein pulsed in Daniel’s temple.

She wanted him to cook?

"Daddy, you’re so smart and handsome. Cooking will be easy for you, right?"

She blinked up at him, all innocence.

Daniel exhaled. After a long pause, he rolled up his sleeves and stepped into the kitchen.

As he fumbled with a pan, Sophia secretly snapped a photo of the chaos and sent it to Evelyn.
###Chapter 6

In the small rented apartment, Evelyn Carter lounged on the couch, a bitter smile playing on her lips as she watched the man moving around the kitchen.

Back when they were together, if Daniel Blackwood ever mentioned he was hungry, she would jump up to cook for him—no matter the hour, even if it was two in the morning.

He had never cooked before. Never even stepped foot in the kitchen. Yet here he was, meticulously preparing a meal for Sophia, a child he had known for less than a day.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

So he could cook. He just hadn’t thought she was worth the effort.

At least he was treating Sophia well.

He wasn’t as cold and ruthless with her as he had been with Evelyn.

Silvercrest Manor

Seated on a tiny chair, Sophia eyed the charred mess on her plate before discreetly dragging Evelyn’s homemade cookies toward her. "I’m not very hungry anymore, Daddy. I’ll just eat these."

Daniel frowned at the bite-sized cookies. "That’s enough?"

Sophia pressed her lips together, afraid he’d insist she try his disastrous cooking, and quickly shielded her plate. "I’m just a kid! This is plenty!"

Her gaze flickered to the blackened lumps on the table, and a flash of horror crossed her face.

Daniel caught every micro-expression. A flicker of irritation tightened his jaw.

Minutes later, the little girl finished every last crumb.

She set the plate down, beamed up at him, and announced, "Daddy, I’m going upstairs for a nap!"

Daniel scooped her up and carried her to her room.

"Can you tell me the story of the little mermaid?" Sophia blinked up at him from her pink bed, her big eyes glistening. "Daddy, are you good at telling stories?"

Daniel flipped open the fairy tale book. "Maybe."

After a pause, he began in his usual deep, no-nonsense tone, "A long time ago, there was a sea. In that sea lived beautiful mermaids—"

"Daddy." Sophia interrupted, wrinkling her nose. "You sound scary!"

Daniel hesitated.

He forced his voice softer, slower. "One day, a little mermaid—"

"Daddy," Sophia pouted, "don’t you know how to tell stories?"

Her lower lip trembled. "Sophia’s daddy is so strong and smart… but he can’t even tell a story right…"

Daniel exhaled sharply. "Maybe we skip the story. Just sleep, okay?"

"No!"

Tears welled in her eyes. "If I don’t hear a story, I’ll have nightmares!"

Daniel’s chest tightened at the sight of her watery eyes.

He brushed a hand over her hair. "Your mother never cried much. Where did you get this habit?"

Sophia sniffled. "Mommy cries too! When I was little, I’d wake up and see her wiping her tears in the dark."

Her innocent words hit him like a punch to the gut.

His voice turned rough. "Your mother… cries often?"

"Yeah." Sophia fiddled with her blanket. "But if Daddy says she doesn’t cry, then maybe I got it from you!"

Daniel didn’t know whether to laugh or sigh.

"I don’t cry," he said flatly.

Sophia hesitated, then peeked up at his stern face. "When Mommy left… you didn’t cry then either?"

Daniel went still.

He studied her for a long moment before standing abruptly. "Sleep. I have work."

Sophia clutched the blanket. "But Daddy—"

"Be good."

He strode out without looking back. "I’ll find someone better to take care of you."

The door clicked shut.

Sophia flopped onto her pillow, restless and anxious.

What had she done?

She’d made Daddy mad again.

Evelyn prepared a simple lunch for Liam but couldn’t bring herself to eat.

Even though Sophia kept texting that she was fine, this was the first time her daughter had been away from her. The worry gnawed at her.

After lunch, Liam grabbed his backpack. "Mommy, Aunt Grace is waiting downstairs. I’m going to art class!"

Evelyn nodded and walked him down.

Liam had always been independent. Before returning, he’d enrolled himself in an art program near Grace’s hospital. Grace picked him up after her shifts.

Evelyn trusted Grace completely—they’d survived hell together.

After seeing Liam off, she returned to washing dishes when the doorbell rang.

She’d just moved in yesterday. Who could it be? Did Liam forget something?

With a sigh, she opened the door. "When will you ever—"

The words died in her throat.

Daniel stood there, tall and imposing in a gray coat, his expression unreadable.

"Hello."

Unlike his usual commanding presence, his tone was eerily calm. "Ms. Carter, we need to talk."

Evelyn crossed her arms, blocking the doorway. "About what?"

The cramped, dim hallway reeked of dampness. Daniel’s nose twitched in distaste.

"Can we speak inside?"

"No." Evelyn shifted, barring his path. "Say it here, Mr. Blackwood."

Her smile was sharp. "I’m a single woman. Wouldn’t want you accusing me of scheming again."

Daniel’s jaw tightened.

No one spoke to him like this—least of all a woman he’d hired as a nanny.

Under normal circumstances, he’d have walked away with a warning.

But this wasn’t normal.

This woman mattered to Sophia.

So he gritted out, "You’re hired. Starting now, you’ll continue as Sophia’s caretaker."
###Chapter 7

Evelyn's lips curled into a skeptical smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, is this some kind of joke? A woman like me—who acted suspiciously around you, whose name just happens to match your late wife's—you're seriously offering me a job?"

Daniel knew she was mocking him.

His eyes narrowed slightly.

If it weren’t for Sophia just returning home and him still figuring out the child’s temperament, he wouldn’t have swallowed his pride to hire this questionable woman.

He had researched her on the way to her apartment.

A woman freshly returned from abroad, financially secure, yet the first job she applied for was as a maid at Silvercrest Manor?

If not him, if not the Blackwood Group—what was her real target?

"Wow."

Just as the tension between them thickened in the doorway, a neighbor’s voice echoed from the corridor. "Is that… Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel was a prominent businessman, a regular in financial headlines. Few in Willowbrook didn’t recognize him.

The man’s voice made Daniel’s jaw tighten.

In one swift motion, he grabbed Evelyn’s wrist, pulled her inside, and slammed the door shut.

Muffled voices lingered outside. "Are you sure?"

"Why would someone like Mr. Blackwood come here and get turned away by a woman?"

"He’s been engaged to Serena Hart for five years…"

Their words faded.

Evelyn crossed her arms, tilting her head. "They’re right, Mr. Blackwood. A man like you doesn’t belong in a place like this."

Daniel scanned the apartment.

Paintings adorned the walls. Potted plants sat on the table. A stuffed bear perched on the entryway cabinet.

For a fleeting moment, it felt like stepping into the past—six years ago, when Evelyn Carter had buzzed around their home.

"We need art here—it’ll brighten the place up!"
"Plants here—fresh air every morning!"
"A little bear by the door, so you’re always greeted with a smile!"

His gaze dropped to the woman before him—same striking eyes, same name.

This Evelyn seemed to be copying his Evelyn.

Her posture. Her decor. Even her habits.

It wouldn’t be hard. His wife had been a public figure, an artist who shared her life online.

Everything left a digital trail.

His attention snagged on the teapot.

A humorless chuckle escaped him as he settled onto the sofa. "Ms. Carter enjoys coffee too?"

Evelyn arched a brow, humming noncommittally.

Daniel took a sip—then smirked.

Arabica. His Evelyn had always preferred Robusta.

He traced the rim of the cup. "Pity. You mimicked my wife’s style, her tastes, even her home…"

His voice turned razor-sharp. "But the coffee betrayed you. My wife drank Robusta. Never Arabica."

Evelyn paused—then laughed. "Ah. So your late wife liked Robusta."

Back then, she’d lied, claiming to love what he did.

If he’d paid attention, he’d have noticed she always drank Arabica.

"Just as I thought. This is deliberate."

The cup hit the table with a clang.

Daniel’s stare turned glacial. "Why go through the trouble of impersonating her? 'I admire her'? Or—" his voice dropped, "—'I want you'?"

Evelyn yawned, feigning boredom. "Or maybe you never loved her. No matter how well I mimic her, you wouldn’t care, would you?"

Silence.

She pressed on, sweetly venomous. "Tell me, Mr. Blackwood—if I wanted to seduce you, shouldn’t I copy Serena? Since you swapped from brother-in-law to fiancé so easily, you must adore her."

Adore her.

The words made his knuckles whiten.

After a beat, he bit out, "I’m engaged to Serena because it was my wife’s dying wish."

Evelyn’s grip on her cup tightened.

Dying wish.

After everything they’d done to her—he dared say that?

She forced a sip, voice light. "How generous of her, gifting her husband away on her deathbed."

Daniel’s expression darkened. "Watch your tongue. I won’t tolerate such remarks again."

He pulled out his phone. Moments later, the door burst open.

Ethan strode in, placing a contract on the table. "Ms. Carter, your employment terms. We’re open to adjustments."

Evelyn skimmed the document.

"Being a maid is secondary." She tapped a clause. "My priority is Sophia."

She negotiated terms briskly, Ethan nodding along.

Daniel stayed silent in the corner, gaze distant.

Half an hour later, the contract was signed.

With that stroke of ink, her infiltration of Silvercrest Manor was set.

As Daniel stood to leave, his phone rang.

The butler’s panicked voice crackled through. "Sir—Ms. Hart is here! She’s dragging Miss Sophia out, calling her a fraud! You need to come now!"
###Chapter 8

"Take care of Sophia. I'm coming home now."

Daniel ended the call abruptly and rose from his seat.

"Wait!"

Hearing Sophia's name, Evelyn shot up. "What happened to her?"

His grip on the door handle tightened slightly. He turned, his cold gaze scrutinizing her face.

Under his piercing stare, Evelyn steadied her breathing. "I'm Sophia's caregiver. It's my job to look after her."

The man pushed the door open and strode into the hallway. "Come with me."

During the drive to Silvercrest Manor, Evelyn tried to ask about Sophia's condition.

He glanced at her and tossed the contract into her lap. "You're not officially her caregiver yet."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, signed the document, and handed it back. "Now will you tell me what's wrong with Sophia, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel's brow furrowed. "Serena showed up to see her."

Evelyn's heart plummeted.

Serena went to see Sophia?

Why?

Sophia was the smallest of her three children. Her brothers had taken most of the nutrients in the womb, leaving her fragile at birth. This was the first time in six years she'd been separated from her mother.

Evelyn shifted restlessly in her seat, her nails digging into her palms. She stared out the window, tension radiating from her. "Can you drive any faster?"

Beside her, Daniel's expression darkened. "Ms. Carter, you seem more concerned about her than I am—and I'm her father."

Evelyn froze.

She hadn't realized how obvious her distress was until he pointed it out.

She swallowed hard. "I just signed the contract. Sophia is my responsibility now. Of course I care."

Daniel's lips curved into a faint, mocking smile. "Is that all?"

His probing tone made her skin prickle. She nodded stiffly. "Yes."

He said nothing more.

Soon, the car pulled up to Silvercrest Manor.

"Sir, thank goodness you're here!" The butler rushed forward as soon as the car stopped.

"What's happening inside?" Daniel demanded.

"They—"

Before he could finish, Evelyn flung open her door and sprinted toward the house.

The air in the foyer felt thick, almost metallic. When Evelyn burst in, Sophia was curled in a corner of the sofa, her small frame hunched, her head bowed.

Opposite her sat Serena, eyes blazing with fury.

"Sophia!" Evelyn rushed forward and gathered the girl into her arms. "Are you hurt?"

Her voice shook uncontrollably. "Are you okay?"

Sophia clutched her sleeve silently. "I'm fine."

"Who the hell are you?" Serena's icy gaze raked over Evelyn with disdain. "Another servant? You look like trouble. Who are you trying to seduce?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw but ignored the jab. She cupped Sophia's face gently. "Let me see."

"I'm okay," the girl mumbled, turning her face away.

Dread coiled in Evelyn's stomach. She gritted her teeth and tilted Sophia's chin up.

There it was.

A vivid handprint marred the child's delicate cheek—angry, swollen, the ridges of fingers clearly imprinted.

An adult had struck her. Hard.

Evelyn's vision blurred with rage.

"It doesn't hurt," Sophia whispered. "The butler gave me ice."

Her daughter's quiet bravery shattered Evelyn's heart.

She looked up, fists clenched, and locked eyes with Serena.

"I hit her," Serena sneered, crossing her arms. "What are you going to do about it?"

"Who are you calling a brat?" Evelyn hissed.

She set Sophia down and advanced on Serena. "She's a child! How could you? What kind of monster hits a five-year-old?"

Serena scoffed. "Age doesn't excuse her behavior. The little pest was running around calling random men 'Daddy.'"

Before the last word left her mouth, Evelyn's palm connected with her face.

Crack!

The slap sent Serena sprawling onto the couch. She clutched her cheek, dazed.

Evelyn glared down at her, lips pressed into a bloodless line.

Once, she'd loved Serena more than anyone.

Her little sister. Her pride. She'd given her everything—even secured her a job at Daniel's company after marriage.

And in return, Serena had conspired with Daniel to destroy her.

Now she'd laid hands on Sophia. A single slap wasn't nearly enough.

"You dare hit me?" Serena scrambled up, face contorted with rage. "I'm Daniel's fiancée! The future lady of this house! You're finished here!"

The staff watched from a distance, unmoving.

Serena cursed them under her breath and lunged at Evelyn.

"Stop!" Sophia's small voice piped up.

The girl tried to intervene but stumbled on the carpet.

"Sophia!" Evelyn whirled toward the sound—

Smack!

Serena's palm cracked against her face. The blow rang in her ears, copper flooding her tongue.

As Serena reared back for another strike, Evelyn reacted faster. She'd worked hard labor for years—Serena's manicured hands were no match.

Evelyn tackled her to the ground.

She licked blood from her split lip. "Had enough?"

Her arm drew back—

A strong hand caught her wrist.

Daniel.

His voice was glacial. "Explain this."

"Daniel, your servant attacked me!"

Serena seized the moment to kick Evelyn square in the ribs. "How dare you touch me!"

The pointed toe of her shoe drove into Evelyn's back, forcing a gasp of pain.

"Auntie!" Sophia scrambled over, shaking free of Daniel's grip. "Auntie, are you okay?"

Daniel turned—then froze.

The glaring handprint on Sophia's face stopped him cold.

He pulled the girl into his arms, his entire demeanor shifting to something dangerous.

"Who did this to you?"
###Chapter 9

Serena pouted dramatically, her voice dripping with false concern. "The moment she walked in, she accused Emily of disrespecting me before slapping her. I couldn't stop her in time."

She even feigned distress, kneeling to brush her fingers against Emily's reddened cheek. "It must have hurt terribly, sweetheart?"

Emily recoiled, her small face twisted in fury as she shoved Serena's hand away and scrambled off Daniel's lap. She rushed to Evelyn, clutching her fingers tightly. "Are...are you okay?"

Evelyn straightened, though the sharp pain from Serena's kick still throbbed in her ribs. "I'm fine."

Serena had put her full strength into that kick. The old injury from six years ago flared up, nearly buckling Evelyn's knees.

Emily knew. Her tiny hands trembled as she tugged Evelyn toward the sofa, forcing her to sit. "Does it hurt?"

The child's genuine worry made Daniel's brow lift slightly.

"Serena," he said coolly, "you claimed she struck Emily?"

Serena's fists clenched at her sides.

She hadn’t expected the brat to side with a mere servant.

"It's strange, isn't it?" Serena sighed, lips pursed. "Why would Emily defend someone who hit her? Unless...she's trying to frame me. Maybe she thinks if she plays nice, you'll blame me instead."

Tears welled in her eyes—forced, calculated. "But who would believe me? It's my word against theirs."

Emily gasped, outrage flashing across her face. "You did hit me!"

Raised sheltered and loved, this was the first time Emily had encountered such a skilled liar.

"I won’t argue with a child," Serena sniffed, wiping nonexistent tears. "If you insist I hurt you, fine. I'll apologize."

She lifted her hand—and lightly slapped her own cheek. "There. We’re even now. Let’s not trouble your father over something so petty."

Emily trembled, tears spilling. "You're lying! You hit me! You blamed Evelyn! You're horrible!"

Her small frame shook with sobs. At six, she was no match for Serena’s manipulation.

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. She pulled Emily close, murmuring comfort before locking eyes with Serena. "You accused me of striking Emily?"

Serena turned away. "I said we should drop this. I’ve apologized. Let’s not upset Emily further."

Evelyn smiled—cold, sharp. "But what if I refuse?"

Daniel watched silently from the sofa, his gaze unreadable.

Releasing Emily, Evelyn pulled a recorder from her pocket.

Serena paled.

She lunged—but Evelyn sidestepped, pressing play.

Serena’s own voice filled the room:

"I hit her."

"What, you want revenge for this brat?"

"She deserved it for calling random men 'Daddy.'"

Serena’s face cycled through shades of horror.

Evelyn pocketed the recorder. "Witnesses. Evidence. Still denying it?" She traced the vivid handprint on Emily’s cheek. "The mark is clear. Should we compare our palms to it?"

Serena’s mouth opened—then closed.

Behind her, Daniel stood. The air turned glacial.

"Emily is my daughter," he said, voice like steel. "I won’t tolerate anyone harming her." His gaze flicked to Serena’s bruised face—Evelyn’s doing. "Consider this settled. But you are no longer welcome at Silvercrest Manor."

Serena’s breath hitched. "Daniel, the public thinks we're engaged—"

"It was never real." He turned away. "I agreed to this charade for Evelyn’s sake. If she knew what you did today, she’d never let you near Emily again."

With that, he strode upstairs. "See her out."

A servant stepped forward. "Ms. Hart, this way."

Serena’s nails dug into her palms. Her venomous glare followed Evelyn and Emily’s retreating figures.

This wasn’t over.
###Chapter 10

"Does it still hurt?"

In the small upstairs bedroom, Evelyn knelt before Sophia, carefully dabbing ointment onto the little girl's cheek with a cotton swab.

"It hurts!" Sophia's big, watery eyes brimmed with tears as she looked up at Evelyn. "Mommy, it hurts so much."

"Shh." Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips, her expression stern. "Remember, I'm just your maid. Call me Auntie."

"Oh."

Sophia sniffled, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. "Auntie, no one's ever hit me like this before." Her small frame trembled with quiet sobs.

Evelyn's chest tightened, her nose stinging with unshed tears.

This was her fault.

She shouldn't have left Sophia alone in Silvercrest Manor just to avoid Daniel's suspicion.

Taking a deep breath, she squeezed Sophia's hand, guilt heavy in her voice. "It's not your fault. That woman is just cruel."

Sophia's lips pressed into a thin line. "I hate her."

"You can't say things like that." Evelyn lowered her voice, smoothing the child's hair. "She's the one your father loves. If you fight with her, you'll only make things harder for him. Stay away from her, okay?"

Serena was an adult, spoiled by Daniel for years, while Sophia was just a little girl who had only just returned to him.

If they couldn't win against her, they had to avoid her.

"I know," Sophia mumbled. "Next time I see her, I'll run the other way."

"Good girl."

Evelyn exhaled shakily before continuing to tend to Sophia's injuries.

Outside the door, a tall figure stood in the hallway, listening. His dark eyes grew colder with every word.

Back in his study, Daniel spoke quietly into his phone. "Ethan, keep looking for a suitable maid for Emily."

Ethan hesitated. "Sir, what about Evelyn—"

Daniel's gaze turned icy. "A woman with an agenda. She won't be staying long."

"Yes, sir!"

——

Once Sophia was asleep, Evelyn tucked her in and retreated to the small servant's quarters Ethan had assigned her.

The room was modest but clean, with everything she needed.

She peeled off her clothes, turning her back to the mirror to inspect the bruise forming along her spine.

Serena had kicked her with full force, right over an old injury. Evelyn sighed at the darkening mark before crouching to dig through the first-aid kit for pain relief.

The door creaked open.

Daniel stood there, his sharp eyes taking in the sight of her in nothing but a bra, the bruise on her waist stark against her pale skin.

"What are you doing?"

Evelyn froze at the sound of his voice. She straightened instantly, turning to face him. "Mr. Blackwood."

Clad only in white lace, her curves were impossible to ignore. Her delicate features, paired with her exposed figure, made for a breathtaking sight.

"Still trying to seduce me?" He leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, his smirk dripping with disdain.

Only then did Evelyn realize her state of undress. She hastily grabbed a robe, wrapping it around herself. "Why are you here, Mr. Blackwood?"

His gaze dropped to the red handprint still visible on her cheek. "Does it hurt?"

Evelyn touched her face absently. In her worry over Sophia and her own injury, she'd forgotten about Serena's slap.

She forced a smile. "No, it's fine."

Daniel stepped inside, sitting on the edge of her bed. His voice was dangerously calm. "Why were you recording us earlier? Most people don't carry a recorder around."

Even now, he was hyper-aware of every detail.

Evelyn's fingers twitched, but she kept her tone light. "Ethan and I were discussing my salary. I wanted proof of our agreement, so I recorded it. When you got the call about Sophia, I followed without turning it off."

"That's all?" He stood, closing the distance between them, his piercing stare making her skin prickle.

Evelyn turned her face away, unable to meet his gaze. "Yes."

"I don't like scheming women." He gripped her chin, forcing her to look at him. "Keep your games to yourself. I can make your life in Mariner's Cove a dream—or Willowbrook a nightmare."

With that, he shoved her aside and strode out.

Evelyn stood frozen, her back damp with cold sweat as she watched his retreating figure.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of it.

Grace's name flashed on the screen.

"Liam's done with his lessons. I dropped him off, but you're not home?"

"Grace." Evelyn swallowed hard. "I need to stay with Sophia tonight. Can you take Liam out for dinner?"

"Of course!"

After hanging up, Grace ruffled Liam's hair. "Come on, kiddo. Let's get some food!"

Liam ducked away from her hand, frowning. "Is Mommy not coming home?"

Grace nodded. "You're staying with me tonight!"

Liam sighed dramatically. "My life is so tragic."

"Hey!" Grace rolled her eyes, dragging him to the mall. After some shopping, they headed to the rooftop restaurant.

The moment they stepped inside, Liam spotted Serena in the corner.

He tugged Grace toward a table nearby, close enough to eavesdrop.

Serena was hissing into her phone, her voice venomous. "I can't believe she survived that accident and had a daughter. Now she's sending the brat back to stake her claim—to prove she's still alive!"

Her nails dug into the table. "If she's using that child as a pawn, I'll make sure it costs her. That little pest got off easy today."

Liam's grip on the menu tightened.

Sophia had been hurt.

No wonder Evelyn wasn't coming home.

His dark eyes glinted with something dangerous as he reached into his pocket.

He'd make Serena pay.
###Chapter 11

Daniel had barely settled into his seat when the server approached Evelyn's table with her order.

Liam's small hand shot out, intercepting the waiter mid-step. His wide, innocent eyes blinked up at the server. "Excuse me, what's that?"

The server couldn't resist smiling at the adorable child. "This is filet mignon, young man. If you'd like some, ask your mother to order it for you."

Liam beamed. "Thank you! You're very pretty!"

The middle-aged waitress practically floated away, her steps lightened by the unexpected compliment.

Grace frowned. "Do you actually want steak?"

Liam smirked. "Nope."

"Then why—"

"Godmother," Liam interrupted, grabbing Grace's phone. "Let's make a wager."

He activated the stopwatch function. "I bet that woman won't last ten more seconds."

Grace eyed him skeptically. "She just started eating." She gave him a sideways glance. "Are you jealous she gets steak?"

"Five... four... three... two..."

Liam placed the phone down triumphantly. "One."

CRASH!

Serena's chopsticks clattered onto the table as her face twisted in sudden discomfort. Grace watched in shock as Serena bolted for the restroom.

"What just—?"

Liam simply lowered his head, smugly twirling his spaghetti.

......

Thirty agonizing minutes later, Serena emerged from the bathroom.

One bite. She'd taken one single bite! Even spoiled food wouldn't act this fast!

Returning to her table, she discovered a small note beneath her chopsticks. Neat handwriting spelled out: [Karma's price.]

Serena shredded the paper violently. "Get your manager! I want security footage!"

Someone would pay for this humiliation.

"I'm sorry, Ms. Hart," the manager stammered. "Our surveillance system was hacked. All footage has been erased."

"Useless!"

In the security room, Serena hurled her glass at the monitor. The screen shattered with a satisfying crack.

This had Evelyn Carter written all over it.

......

10:07 PM.

The black Maserati purred to a stop before Silvercrest Manor.

Daniel ended his final international call and stepped out, exhaustion lining his features. His feet automatically carried him toward the master suite—then paused.

Turning, he strode toward the children's wing at the corridor's end.

Empty.

"Welcome home, sir." The butler appeared silently. "Looking for young miss?"

Daniel arched a brow. "Where is she?"

The butler sighed. "Miss Sophia insisted on sleeping with Evelyn. The nursery beds being rather small... she's currently in the servant's quarters downstairs."

He studied Daniel's expression carefully. "Shall I retrieve her?"

Daniel said nothing, descending the stairs instead. He stood motionless before Evelyn's closed door.

The butler produced a key.

Inside, only a bedside lamp illuminated the scene. Daniel's tall frame cast long shadows as he loomed over the bed.

Evelyn in gray pajamas cradled pink-clad Sophia protectively, even in sleep shielding the girl's injured cheek.

The domestic scene struck him as oddly... warm.

Daniel scoffed at himself. Madness.

Sophia was his and Evelyn Carter's daughter—proof of their love. This Evelyn was merely an opportunistic maid playing games.

After a long moment, he turned away.

"Add another bed to the nursery tomorrow."

"At once, sir!"

The door clicked shut. Footsteps faded down the hall.

Beneath the moonlight, Evelyn's eyes snapped open, lips curling in a cold smile.

......

Dawn broke peacefully.

Evelyn rose early, preparing breakfast for Sophia—and an extra portion for Daniel.

She'd cooked for him daily during their marriage. Had his tastes changed in six years?

As she set the table, Sophia emerged in tiny pajamas, freshly washed.

"Waffles! My favorite!" The girl's eyes sparkled as she climbed onto her chair. "This looks amazing!"

"Does it now?" Daniel's rich baritone floated from the staircase.

Sophia looked up—and froze. Her father descended like some dark prince, his beauty almost painful to behold.

The girl's cheeks pinkened. "Good morning, Daddy."

"Morning." He took the seat opposite her.

Sophia forked a waffle piece toward him. "Try it! Evelyn made these!"

Daniel eyed the untouched food. "You haven't tasted it yet."

"I just know!" She stuffed a bite in her mouth. "See? Delicious!"

His gaze dropped to her cheek. "Does it still hurt?"

Sophia blinked, then glanced at Evelyn. "Daddy, aren't you going to ask Evelyn? Her injuries were worse."

Daniel sipped his coffee. "Adults don't feel pain. Even if they do, it's not my concern."

Sophia's lower lip trembled silently.

......

After breakfast, Daniel departed.

The butler gave Sophia and Evelyn a tour of Silvercrest Manor's sprawling grounds. While Sophia marveled at every novelty, Evelyn moved through familiar spaces with detached boredom.

Every corner held memories of her foolish younger self—infatuated with that monster.

At lunch, Sophia barely touched her food. Assuming the child needed time adjusting, Evelyn slipped out during break to buy her favorite tangerines.

She'd barely cleared the gates when a red Ferrari screeched to a halt beside her.

The window lowered, revealing Serena's smug face. "We need to talk."
###Chapter 12

Evelyn barely glanced at Serena as she walked past, heading straight for the bus stop. "We have nothing to discuss."

"Is that really true, or are you just too scared to face me?" Serena flung the car door open and grabbed Evelyn’s wrist. "Don’t think I don’t see right through you!"

"You’re younger than me, aren’t you? You’re practically still a child yourself—far from being a mother. Yet here you are, slaving away for a six-year-old girl, all for a measly monthly paycheck?"

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "Then tell me—why am I doing this?"

Serena’s eyes narrowed.

Yesterday had been chaotic, and she hadn’t paid much attention to Evelyn’s appearance. But now, up close, she couldn’t deny the woman’s striking beauty—flawless, as if sculpted by an artist’s hand.

"You’re pretty, I’ll give you that. But let’s be clear—Daniel is my fiancé. I suggest you keep your greedy little hands off him."

Evelyn smirked.

Had Serena considered Daniel’s marital status when she’d seduced him?

Now, with their roles reversed, she had the audacity to call her shameless?

If this was shamelessness, then Serena had long since abandoned any claim to dignity.

Evelyn locked eyes with her, voice icy. "And what if I don’t? What will you do about it?"

She tilted her head toward the blazing sun overhead. "Will you kill me right here, in broad daylight?"

"Don’t be ridiculous." Serena pulled a voice recorder from her pocket, lips curling in triumph. "You’re not the only one who knows how to gather evidence."

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. Fast learner.

"I’m playing this for Daniel right now. Enjoy unemployment."

With that, she climbed back into her car, revved the engine, and sped off, leaving Evelyn standing there, brow furrowed.

She hadn’t expected Serena to pull this move—running straight to Daniel with a recording.

But it didn’t matter. The game had only just begun, and Daniel didn’t trust her much anyway.

Serena stormed into Daniel’s office, recorder clutched tightly in her hand.

Inside, he was in the middle of a high-stakes international conference call.

"Daniel!"

Despite Ethan’s attempts to stop her, Serena barged in.

"I knew there was something off about that maid the second I saw her in your house yesterday! And now I’ve got proof!"

Daniel’s expression darkened, his voice dropping to a dangerous chill. "Get. Out."

"Daniel, I—" She tried to continue, but the voices of executives crackled through the computer speakers. "Mr. Blackwood, if now isn’t a good time, we can reschedule."

Serena froze. Had she just interrupted his meeting?

"We’ll reconvene later." He ended the call with a sharp click, then fixed her with an icy stare. "Speak."

Biting her lip, Serena hesitantly pressed play.

"I suggest you keep your greedy little hands off Daniel!"

"And what if I don’t?"

"What will you do about it?"

"Will you kill me right here, in broad daylight?"

The recording ended. Serena lifted her chin defiantly. "Daniel, this woman—the one taking care of Emily—she’s selfish. She has ulterior motives! Didn’t you say you wouldn’t tolerate suspicious people around you?"

Her voice softened, pleading. "She might be good with Emily, but she doesn’t genuinely care. Someone like that shouldn’t stay."

"I’m aware." Daniel leaned back in his chair, lazily assessing her. "But Emily’s attached to her now. She just came back to me—I won’t make her unhappy. Besides, she does her job well."

Serena hesitated. "I could take care of Emily myself. She’s my sister’s daughter, after all. Blood matters."

"You?" His lips curled in a mocking smile. "The same way you ‘cared’ for her with your slaps?"

Her rehearsed words died in her throat.

After a beat, she sniffled, tears welling. "Daniel, about yesterday… It was a misunderstanding. I didn’t know Emily was yours and my sister’s child. I thought she was an imposter—that’s why I hit her."

She dabbed at her eyes dramatically. "I’m her aunt. Even if I made a mistake, you can’t shut me out like this. If my sister were alive, she’d want me looking after Emily, not some scheming stranger—"

Her sobs were loud, theatrical, grating on Daniel’s nerves.

He cut her off coldly. "Plenty of people have ulterior motives around me. When I first got involved with Evelyn, didn’t you have your own agenda? Yet I let you stay."

Serena’s tears vanished instantly. She opened her mouth—then closed it.

That single sentence told her everything. He wouldn’t bend to her will.

Defeated, she turned and stalked out.

Once she was gone, Ethan entered, placing a thick file on Daniel’s desk. "All her overseas records, sir."

Daniel flipped it open.

"Seems Evelyn’s background checks out."

Ethan nodded. "She grew up, studied, and worked abroad, only returning recently. She was a senior jewelry designer—not a master, but skilled. Why would someone like that come back just to be a maid for little Emily?"

Daniel’s eyes narrowed.

The file was too detailed. Every phase of her life meticulously documented, witnesses listed.

Too perfect. Too deliberate.

"Dig deeper." His voice was steel. "She claims she’s strapped for cash, but her designer salary overseas was substantial. She’s neither broke nor shallow."

He steepled his fingers, gaze distant and calculating. "If her goal is just me, fine. But I’m more concerned she’s after something else."

He’d known from the start—Evelyn Carter was no simple woman.
###Chapter 13

The file on Evelyn Carter spanned ten pages.
Daniel Blackwood scrutinized every detail but found no inconsistencies. Frustrated, he pushed back his chair and headed to the restroom.

"Alright, behave yourself in there." A child's voice echoed the moment Daniel stepped inside. His hands froze under the running water.

Company policy strictly prohibited employees from bringing children to work. So why was there a kid here at this hour?

Frowning, he followed the sound to a stall. Just as he raised his hand to knock, the door swung open violently.

Thwack!

The edge of the door collided with Daniel's forehead. He hissed, pressing a hand to the throbbing spot.

Liam Carter emerged, a flicker of mischief in his eyes before he widened them in exaggerated remorse. "Oh no! I'm so sorry! I didn't know anyone was there!"

Daniel lowered his hand, studying the boy who barely reached his knee. Despite his small stature, Liam carried an air of boldness unusual for his age.

Children had never held Daniel's interest, but this one—likely around Emily's age—strangely softened his usual sternness.

"Why are you here?" Daniel's voice remained icy.

Liam grinned. "Weird question, mister. Bathrooms are for peeing, right?"

Not that he'd actually needed to go. He'd spotted Daniel leaving his office and staged this entire encounter.

No one bullied Emily and got away with it.

Daniel's frown deepened. "I meant, why are you in this building? Who are your parents?"

Liam's lips trembled. Tears welled instantly. "My dad's dead. The grass on his grave is taller than me..."

"My mom's working two jobs to feed us. It's... really hard."

Daniel held up a hand. "Then why are you here alone?"

"My godmother brought me." Liam sniffled. "She's in a meeting..."

The tension in Daniel's shoulders eased slightly.

"Waaah!" Liam wailed louder, watching Daniel's reaction from the corner of his eye. "Stupid dad! Why'd he have to die? If he'd lasted just five more years—"

Each self-deprecating word about his "dead father" made Daniel increasingly uneasy.

Had fatherhood softened him since reconnecting with Emily?

Against his instincts, Daniel crouched and patted Liam's back. The boy's crying halted abruptly.

Liam wiped fake tears. "You're right. Dead people don't come back. Hope that irresponsible jerk reincarnates as someone better!"

This kid was crossing lines.

Daniel stood abruptly. "Children shouldn't speak ill of adults."

"Okay."

Liam knew when to quit. He inhaled dramatically and marched out.

"Liam!"

Grace Thornton had been waiting anxiously outside. Spotting him, she waved—then froze. The towering figure behind Liam was unmistakably Daniel Blackwood.

"My godmother's here! Bye!" Liam chirped before darting to Grace's side.

"Willowbrook Enterprises prohibits children on premises," Daniel's voice cut through Grace's panic as she tried to flee. "While you're not an employee, refrain from bringing him next time."

He disappeared down the corridor.

Hmph.

Liam shot a discreet middle finger at Daniel's retreating back.

Grace yanked him close. "Do you know who that was? Daniel Blackwood owns this entire tower! Cross him, and we're finished in Willowbrook!"

Liam nodded. "I know."

He'd never intended to get close anyway.

"Daddy, isn't Auntie's cooking amazing?" Emily twirled in her pink dress at dinner, eyes sparkling.

"Passable." Daniel took a measured bite. "The flavor reminds me of someone."

It mirrored Evelyn Carter's cooking from years ago. Clearly, this Evelyn had studied his preferences thoroughly.

His gaze turned glacial as it landed on the woman serving them. "Any incidents today?"

Evelyn nodded. "Ms. Hart approached me at the market. She demanded to know if I had... designs on you."

Meeting his eyes squarely, she continued, "Her prejudice may strain your relationship. To avoid that, perhaps I should care for Emily during daytime hours only?"

Living elsewhere would grant her time to monitor Liam—not that he needed supervision, but his schemes required containment.

"Unnecessary." Daniel dabbed his lips with a napkin. "She holds no authority over who enters my home."

Evelyn tilted her head. "But isn't Ms. Hart your fiancée?"

"Mr. Blackwood, I'm curious. The news claims you've been engaged for five years. Why no wedding? Why doesn't she live here?"
###Chapter 14

Daniel's fork halted mid-air.

He lifted his gaze, those dark eyes assessing Evelyn with chilling detachment. "If I let her move in, wouldn't that eliminate any chance for those women vying for my attention?"

His words made Evelyn narrow her eyes briefly before she forced a smile. "I always assumed Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Hart had an unbreakable bond. Seems I overestimated it."

Daniel's lips curved slightly. "Even so, those who approach me with ulterior motives from the start stand no chance."

"Then you're a remarkably devoted man," Evelyn countered dryly. "Clearly, I misjudged you."

The tension at the table thickened until Emily suddenly slammed her tiny palms between them. "Stop fighting!"

"We're not."

Emily's distressed voice snapped Evelyn back to reality. She exhaled sharply and offered Daniel a tight smile. "Mr. Blackwood, don't misunderstand. I simply think the future lady of the house already despises me. My prolonged stay here would be... inappropriate."

Daniel's brows furrowed. "This is my home. Whether you stay or leave is my decision. And you're just staff. Don't concern yourself with matters above your station. Serena isn't the mistress here." He speared vegetables onto Emily's plate. "This manor has always had its lady."

Evelyn stifled a bitter laugh.

The "lady" he referred to—was it her?

Absurd.

He'd shown her nothing but coldness during their marriage, then murdered her for Serena. Now he pretended to be some paragon of loyalty?

This performance was for Emily's benefit. Had guilt finally caught up with him?

Evelyn smirked. "But isn't the former lady of this house dead?"

"She's not dead!" Daniel slammed his spoon down, eyes blazing. "My wife is alive. Choose your next words carefully—unless you want consequences."

Evelyn held his glare. "The news reported her death. If she's alive, where is she?"

The air turned glacial as their stares clashed.

"Enough!"

Emily shoved her plate away, eyes glistening. "This is our first dinner together! Why are you fighting?" She fled upstairs before they could respond.

Daniel shot Evelyn a warning look before pursuing her.

Evelyn remained seated, watching him disappear. She exhaled slowly.

She shouldn't have provoked him in front of Emily. But six years of agony had carved fury into her bones. Every sleepless night, she'd imagined tearing his chest open to see if his heart was as black as his deeds.

Upstairs...

"Emily." Daniel eased open her bedroom door.

The girl was curled under her quilt, trembling. His chest tightened. He sat beside her, gently rubbing her back. "Don't cry."

He wasn't skilled at comforting children, but his touch was soft, his voice uncharacteristically gentle.

Eventually, Emily peeked out, eyes red-rimmed. "Daddy... don't be mad at Auntie."

Daniel stilled.

He'd expected complaints. Instead, her first words were a plea for Evelyn?

His resistance crumbled. He gathered her close. "You like her that much?"

Emily nodded against his shoulder. "So much. Please don't scold her."

Daniel sighed. Reluctantly, he acquiesced with a nod.

After a pause, he murmured, "Why did you cry? Do you miss your mother?"

Emily nodded again, silent.

"Then... where is she?" he probed. "Let me take you to her."

"No." Emily shook her head firmly. "Mommy said you'll meet when it's time. She told you not to look for her. Just... be nice to me."

Daniel studied her face—so like her mother's—and clenched his jaw.

"Daddy," Emily whispered, "Auntie said you're marrying that mean lady from yesterday... Is it true?"

Daniel hesitated. "Adult matters don't concern you."

"But why?" Emily's voice cracked. "Don't you love Mommy anymore?"

The question struck like a blade.

If he could stop loving Evelyn Carter, he would have. Six years apart, yet she haunted him still.

His silence made Emily sigh. "You don't." Her lip trembled. "There aren't any pictures of you and Mommy here."

Since birth, Emily had only known Evelyn's current face—artificial, according to her brothers. She'd searched every corner for traces of her mother's past, finding nothing.

Daniel cupped her face. "Sleep. Tomorrow, you'll see pictures of us."

Emily sniffled. "Promise?"

"Promise."

Dawn barely broke when Serena stormed past security into Silvercrest Manor.

Her blood turned to ice.

A wedding portrait dominated the foyer: Evelyn in white, Daniel approaching with flowers.

Rage exploded in her chest.

She'd burned every photo of Evelyn after faking her death, claiming it would spare Daniel pain.

Now, after two days with that brat, this abomination hung proudly in her home?

With a shriek, Serena ripped it down and smashed it against the floor.

That witch.

Both mother and daughter—disgusting!
###Chapter 15

"I want cake!"

Sophia tugged at Evelyn's hand with excitement sparkling in her eyes. "The caramel apple flavor we had last time."

Evelyn chuckled and ruffled the girl's hair. "Alright, sweetheart."

As they descended the grand staircase of Silvercrest Manor, Evelyn's breath caught. There, framed in ornate silver, hung a photograph that stopped her dead in her tracks.

Her younger self, radiant in white satin, gazed adoringly at Daniel. The love in her eyes could have powered constellations.

Daniel's expression? Cold as the marble beneath their feet.

Sophia noticed Evelyn's sudden stillness. The child's small fingers tightened around hers. "Auntie...?"

Evelyn forced a smile, but her pulse roared in her ears. She remembered selecting each wedding photo with trembling hands, hanging them where Daniel's eyes would fall. Foolish girl. She'd believed love could melt glaciers.

Now? The glacier had won.

"Ms. Hart isn't permitted here," the butler's strained voice floated up from the foyer. "Mr. Blackwood's orders."

Serena's shrill retort sliced through the air. "That woman gets to live here, but I can't visit? Ridiculous!"

Evelyn's grip on Sophia tightened as Serena's stilettos crunched over shattered glass. The wedding portrait lay in ruins, Serena's designer shoe grinding Evelyn's smiling face into oblivion.

"Stop!" Sophia wrenched free and charged downstairs.

Evelyn lunged after her, scooping the child up before she could cut herself on the glass. "Careful, sweetheart."

Serena smirked. "Oh, does this upset you?" Her manicured finger jabbed toward Sophia. "Did you make Daniel hang these? Pathetic."

Sophia's tiny chin jutted out. "Daddy said Mommy's the lady of this house. Her pictures belong here!"

"The lady?" Serena's laugh turned shrill. "I'm Daniel's fiancée! Me!"

Evelyn pressed Sophia's face into her shoulder, murmuring, "Let's get that cake, hm?" She shot the butler a look. "Please inform Mr. Blackwood what happened here."

Serena blocked their path. "Go ahead! Daniel would never—"

"If Daddy loves you most," Sophia piped up, "why are Mommy's pictures everywhere and not yours?"

Serena's mouth opened. Closed.

Evelyn seized the moment to escape, Sophia's triumphant giggle muffled against her neck. Behind them, Serena's enraged scream was cut off by a yelp—likely from stepping on glass.

At the clinic, Grace Thornton rolled her eyes at the nurse's plea. "I don't do stitches for spoiled socialites."

Liam tugged Grace's sleeve, eyes wide. "Please, Godmother? For me?"

Grace narrowed her eyes. "Since when do you care about Serena Hart?"

Liam's grin turned impish as he rummaged through his backpack. "I just remembered... I've got something special for her treatment."

Grace peered into the bag. "Is that... chili flakes?"

"Worse." Liam held up a vial with a devilish smirk. "Ghost pepper extract."

Grace's laughter echoed down the hall as the nurse led a limping Serena toward them.
###Chapter 16

The moment Serena Hart stepped into Grace Thornton's office, the air turned icy.

"Make sure you stitch this properly. I won't tolerate any scars," Serena snapped before slumping into the chair, already scrolling through her phone.

Grace suppressed her irritation. She was a professional, after all. Biting back a retort, she focused on the wound.

Just as Grace knelt to begin, Oliver Carter "accidentally" stumbled—right onto Serena's injured leg.

"Ah!"

His little fingers pressed directly into the wound, conveniently smearing salt from his palm onto the raw flesh.

Serena shrieked, nearly launching out of the seat. Grace froze in shock.

"Sorry!" Oliver ducked his head, eyes wide with feigned innocence. "Pretty Auntie, it was an accident! I just... tripped..."

Serena's face twisted in pain and fury. "An accident? That's all?"

Oliver blinked, lips trembling. "If you're mad... you can trip on me too?"

Serena's nostrils flared. Was this brat mocking her?

"Forgive him—he's my godson," Grace murmured, dabbing alcohol onto the wound. "This will sting."

Another ear-splitting scream echoed through the office.

Grace worked quickly, suturing the injury while Serena glared at her phone. Just as the drama reached its climax—

Wi-Fi password incorrect.

Serena scowled. "What the—?"

Oliver inched closer. "Let me fix it for you? To make up for earlier."

After a suspicious glance, Serena handed over her phone.

Oliver synced her messages to his burner phone in seconds, wiped the traces, and reconnected her to the newly reset Wi-Fi.

"All done!" He beamed, returning it.

Serena smirked. "Fine. You're forgiven."

Oliver grinned back. "You're the nicest auntie ever!"

The second Serena left, Grace cornered him. "Salt? Really? And the restaurant bathroom lockout—that was you too, wasn't it? What's your problem with her?"

Oliver flopped onto the exam bed. "Guess."

That night, after tucking Sophia in, Evelyn Carter slipped out to call Oliver.

"I know you're busy with Sophia," he said, voice oddly mature. "Grace is taking good care of me."

Evelyn hesitated. "You and Sophia..."

He exhaled. "Be careful. That woman's trouble." He'd seen Serena's texts—but phones didn't reveal everything.

"I know." Evelyn pinched her brow. "Don't cause Grace any problems, understand?"

"Please. I'm not a baby." Oliver rolled his eyes. "All the nurses adore me."

Evelyn chuckled at his tone before hanging up.

Back in the mansion, shattered wedding photos littered the coffee table—Serena's doing. Evelyn's chest tightened.

She knelt, carefully reassembling the fragments. Despite everything, these were... happy memories.

A cold voice cut through the silence. "What are you doing?"

Evelyn jerked back. Daniel Blackwood loomed on the stairs, gaze locked on her hands.

"I—I thought you might want these fixed," she stammered.

He strode over, snatching the pieces away. "Don't touch my things." His fingers lingered on the photo. "This won't earn you favor."

Evelyn bowed her head—hiding a smirk. Good. Let him think she was scheming.

"Of course, Mr. Blackwood." She turned to leave.

"Sophia." He sank onto the sofa. "Was she upset today?"

Evelyn paused. "A little." Her voice softened. "You must love her very much."

Daniel's brow arched.

"No photos of your ex-wife before, and now they're everywhere?" She glanced back, smiling. "All for Sophia, right?"

His eyes narrowed. "You're unusually invested in my marriage."

"Naturally." Her smile sharpened. "I did come here to admire you."

A derisive snort. Of course—another gold-digger.

"Remember your place," he said icily. "This position isn't for just anyone."

Evelyn's grin widened as she climbed the stairs.

Perfect.
###Chapter 17

Evelyn remained unfazed under Daniel's icy stare as she gave a slight nod. "Understood."

She turned to head upstairs but paused at the landing. "Ms. Hart came by early this morning and destroyed the photos. Ms. Sophia was upset all day. If you can't manage your relationship with Ms. Hart, don't just indulge Sophia's requests. That way, you won't end up with two unhappy women."

Daniel's gaze hardened as he watched her retreating figure. "Are you trying to tell me how to handle my affairs?"

"Just a suggestion." Her voice was calm, detached. "If Ms. Sophia stays miserable, it only means more work for me."

Without another word, she continued upstairs, leaving behind nothing but indifference.

Daniel frowned, watching her disappear down the hall.

The next morning, Serena was jolted awake by her phone ringing.

"Ms. Hart, I'm downstairs. Mr. Blackwood sent me to pick you up. He wants to see you."

"Daniel wants to see me?!" Serena nearly leaped out of bed, heart pounding. This was the first time in years he'd sought her out so early.

"Give me a minute! I'll be right down!"

An hour later, she emerged, makeup flawless, a flowing dress hugging her frame as she slid elegantly into the car.

Daniel sat in the backseat, eyes closed, dressed in black. The sight of him made her breath hitch. "Daniel, I didn’t expect you to come yourself—"

"Ethan," he cut in smoothly, "take us to the restaurant."

At the restaurant, Daniel took a sip of coffee before speaking. "In two weeks, I’ll be taking you to Grandmother’s birthday party. You’ve played the role of my fiancée for six years. It’s time for a change in status."

Serena’s eyes sparkled.

So that was why he’d summoned her!

She bit her lip, feigning shyness. "I don’t mind... I mean, I’d love to."

Daniel’s expression didn’t waver. "I’ll announce the end of our engagement that night."

Clang.

Her fork clattered onto the plate. "Daniel, what are you saying?"

He continued eating calmly. "I only maintained this arrangement to fulfill Evelyn Carter’s last wish. Once she was gone, you needed protection, so I kept you close."

His gaze lifted, cold and unfeeling. "I told you from the start—if either of us found someone else, this farce would end."

Serena’s nails dug into her palms. "But neither of us has—"

"But Sophia came back."

He set down his utensils. "Her existence proves Evelyn never died. If my wife is alive, this engagement has no purpose."

A pause. "And you made Sophia miserable yesterday. The staff told me."

He wiped his mouth. "At the party, I’ll reveal Sophia’s identity first. Then I’ll dissolve our engagement."

With that, he stood and left.

Serena sat frozen, then erupted, sweeping everything off the table in a rage.

How dare he!

All because of that brat!

If Sophia hadn’t returned, Daniel would still be hers.

Her eyes darkened.

If that child disappeared... everything would go back to normal.

At noon, Serena arrived at Blackwood Group with a lunchbox.

Daniel frowned when she entered his office. "What are you doing here?"

She smiled sweetly. "Bringing you lunch... Brother-in-law."

The term made him stiffen.

"Why call me that?"

"Since Evelyn’s alive and our engagement’s ending, it’s only right." She handed him the food. "After our talk, I realized I’ve been selfish. Even if we’re not engaged, you’ll always be family."

Daniel nodded slowly.

"It’s just... Sophia doesn’t like me." She sighed. "I’d like to take her out tomorrow. Bond a little. For Evelyn’s sake."

He considered it, then agreed.

Good. Maybe Serena was finally coming to her senses.

"Thank you, Brother-in-law!" Her eyes gleamed with hidden malice. "I’ll make sure it’s perfect!"

At dinner, Daniel told Sophia the plan.

"I don’t want to!" She crossed her arms. "She’s mean!"

Daniel sighed. "She’s your aunt. You should try."

Evelyn’s chest ached.

After everything, he still pushed Sophia toward Serena.

Did he care about his daughter at all?

"Evelyn." His voice snapped her back.

"You’ll go with Sophia tomorrow. Extra guards will accompany you."

She exhaled. "Do I have a choice?"

"Your job is to keep her safe. Nothing else."

"...Yes, sir."

Later, Sophia flopped onto her bed. "I won’t bond with her! All my love is for Mommy!"

Evelyn chuckled, soothing her as she texted Oliver.

She missed her son.

His reply came instantly:

[Mommy. Don’t go tomorrow.]

A chill ran down her spine as she read the synced message from Serena’s phone:

[Kill the brat.]

No details. Just those three words.

[Mommy, promise me you won’t go!]
###Chapter 18

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Why?"

"That woman is dangerous!" Liam blurted out, his voice tight with urgency. "Mom, I can't explain how I know, but it's obvious she wants to hurt Sophia. Don't let her go out with Serena tomorrow!"

The woman exhaled slowly. "Liam, I've already considered that. But you know I don't have the final say. Daniel has always been protective of her."

If Evelyn interfered with Sophia and Serena's "bonding time," Daniel's suspicions would only grow. Her position gave her little power to shield Sophia—which was exactly why she'd been furious when Liam sent Sophia to Daniel in the first place.

She inhaled deeply. "Don't worry. I'll do everything I can to keep her safe."

At least the amusement park was crowded. With her presence and the bodyguards Daniel had assigned, Serena wouldn't dare act recklessly in public.

"But..." Liam clenched his jaw, guilt weighing his voice. "I shouldn't have sent Sophia to Daniel Blackwood..."

He'd only wanted Sophia to be their eyes and ears, helping Evelyn complete her plan faster. He never imagined Serena would go so far as to target a six-year-old.

"Let's not dwell on it," Evelyn murmured. "I can't be with you right now. Be good for Grace, okay?"

"Fine." His voice was flat. "I'll hang up now, Mom."

"And Liam," she added sharply, "no more schemes involving Serena and Daniel. Understood?"

"Yeah."

The next morning, Serena arrived at Silvercrest Manor.

Following Daniel's orders, the guards stopped her at the gate.

Standing in the courtyard, Serena called out sweetly, "Sophia! Come out! I'm taking you somewhere fun!"

Upstairs in the nursery, Sophia sat stiffly as Evelyn braided her hair, her lips pressed into a thin line. "I don't want her as my aunt. I hate her! I really hate her!"

She huffed. "Why is Daddy making me spend time with her? I told him I don’t like her, but he won’t listen!"

Evelyn's fingers stilled in her daughter's hair. "Serena is someone your father cares about. She might even become his wife someday. Remember what I told you? You can't keep saying you hate something—or someone—that he loves."

Sophia's face twisted with frustration. "I'm just complaining to you..."

"Not even to me."

"Okay," the girl muttered, though her scowl didn't fade.

Outside, Serena's voice grew impatient. "Sophia! Let's go!"

She wasn't a woman who tolerated delays.

Within half an hour, she'd sent servants inside to hurry them over a dozen times while she shouted from the courtyard.

Annoyed, Sophia barely touched her breakfast before dragging Evelyn outside.

"Sophia—"

Serena was still waiting, her gaze fixed on the nursery window. "We're going to the amusement park! It'll be so much fun! Come on!"

She smirked. "Your father's busy, and your mother was too scared to come back. So as your future stepmother, it's my job to take you out—"

"Stop yelling," Sophia snapped, stepping onto the porch with a glare. "You're so loud."

A flicker of irritation crossed Serena's face before she forced a smile. She swept forward and pulled Sophia into an embrace. "I was worried you'd fallen back asleep!"

She cooed over Sophia's outfit and braids. "You look adorable today!"

Her voice was honey-sweet, her touch gentle—but the falseness of it made Sophia shudder.

The girl instinctively glanced back at Evelyn, who gave her a reassuring nod.

"Let's get in the car."

Noticing their silent exchange, Serena's smile tightened. She practically shoved Sophia into the backseat. When Evelyn moved to follow, Serena blocked her.

"You think you're riding with us?" She sneered. "You're just the nanny. Know your place. Ride with the bodyguards—I don’t need you interfering with my time with Sophia."

Evelyn's jaw clenched. "She skipped breakfast. I have food in my bag."

"I can handle that."

Serena snatched the bag from Evelyn's grip, slid into the car, and slammed the door.

"Take the other car!"

With no choice, Evelyn shot Sophia a meaningful look before climbing into the trailing vehicle.

As the cars pulled away, Evelyn settled between the guards and slipped on her earpiece.

She'd anticipated Serena's schemes. That's why she'd modified Sophia's necklace.

Serena's voice crackled through the earpiece.

"Sophia, sweetheart, where is your mother?"

"Did she teach you to be so rude to me?"

"Why hasn’t she come back? Did she send you alone because she’s using you to manipulate your father?"

A pause. Then, softer: "Poor thing. Only six, and already a pawn..."

Sophia stayed silent the entire ride.

The amusement park was packed—which eased Evelyn's nerves. Crowds meant safety.

Serena plastered on a smile, buying tickets and pointing out attractions. Following Evelyn's advice, Sophia refused every high-risk ride, claiming she was scared.

Serena's patience frayed.

But at the Skywheel, Sophia froze.

Her eyes lit up as she stared at the towering ride. "Can... can we go on this one?"

"Of course!" Serena's smile turned triumphant. She snapped at a guard, "Get two tickets for the princess!"

Once the tickets were secured, Serena turned to Evelyn with mock sweetness. "You've been hovering all morning like I'm some kind of monster."

She flopped onto a bench. "You take her. That way, you won’t accuse me of sabotage later."

Evelyn's instincts screamed that something was off—but before she could react, Sophia grabbed her hand, bouncing excitedly. "Auntie, I really want to ride with you!"

She knew Evelyn loved the Skywheel. Back overseas, she'd been too busy to ever go.

This was their chance.

Grinning, Sophia tugged Evelyn toward the ride. "I'm so happy!"

Evelyn had no choice but to follow.

As the Skywheel began its ascent, Serena leaned back, smirking at the guard beside her. "Everything ready?"

"Yes, ma'am."

Her smile widened.

They liked the Skywheel?

Good.

They'd never come down.
###Chapter 19

"Mommy! This is magical!"

Sophia pressed her tiny hands against the glass of the Skywheel capsule, her eyes wide with wonder as she took in the sprawling view of Willowbrook Amusement Park below. "I never knew the world could look so small from up here!"

The six-year-old bounced excitedly in her seat, her first Skywheel ride turning her into a bundle of unrestrained joy. "Look! The people down there are like little dots!"

Evelyn Carter smiled softly beside her daughter, though her heart ached with unspoken guilt.

Her children had endured too much hardship. Especially Sophia.

Had circumstances been different, her bright-eyed girl would have been spoiled rotten, visiting theme parks whenever she pleased—not experiencing this simple childhood pleasure for the first time at six years old.

She wouldn't be a target for someone like Serena Hart.

Evelyn swallowed the lump in her throat and pulled Sophia close. "Sweetheart, I promise once everything settles, we'll come here every weekend. Just you and me."

Sophia turned, her earnest gaze locking with Evelyn's. "And Oliver will get better too, right?"

"Absolutely." Evelyn nodded firmly.

"Mommy!" Sophia threw her arms around Evelyn's neck with enough force to make them both sway.

Their capsule chose that moment to reach the Skywheel's zenith.

CRACK!

A deafening metallic groan shuddered through their suspended compartment. The entire capsule lurched violently sideways.

"Ah!" Sophia lost her grip and tumbled across the tilted floor.

Evelyn's heart stopped. She lunged forward, barely catching Sophia's wrist before the girl could slam into the glass.

"Hold onto me!"

Even bracing against the safety rail with all her strength, the violent shaking sent mother and daughter sliding dangerously toward the now downward-facing door.

When the tremors finally ceased, their capsule hung at a sickening 45-degree angle.

The door beneath them creaked ominously. One more jolt and they'd plummet 300 feet to the pavement below.

Sophia trembled violently in Evelyn's arms.

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins as realization struck.

This wasn't just harassment.

Serena meant to kill them both.

Working quickly, Evelyn fashioned a makeshift harness from her jacket straps, securing Sophia to the sturdiest rail. She then tied her own wrist to an overhead support with her scarf.

"Mommy..." Sophia's voice quivered. "Are we going to—"

"We're not." Evelyn cut her off sharply, fumbling for her phone.

No signal.

Her knuckles turned white around the device.

She'd underestimated Serena's cruelty—and Daniel Blackwood's blind devotion to his stepsister.

BOOM!

The door gave way with a horrific screech of tearing metal. Evelyn watched in mute horror as it spiraled downward, disappearing into the screaming crowd below.

"MOMMY!" Sophia shrieked, her small body jerking against the restraints.

Evelyn's mind blanked.

Below, panicked shouts rose from the gathering crowd:

"Someone's trapped up there!"

"That capsule's door just fell off!"

"They'll be paste if they fall from that height!"

Serena Hart adjusted her sunglasses lazily from her VIP lounge chair. She gestured to the bodyguard beside her. "Call Daniel. Tell him the nanny insisted on taking Emily on that death trap against my advice."

The man hesitated. "But the investigation—"

Serena's lips curled. "Who's going to contradict us? The dead?" She flicked her wrist dismissively. "Have maintenance 'accidentally' delay the rescue until... well, you know."

As the guard hurried off, Serena leaned back with a contented sigh, watching the dangling capsule through her designer shades.

'Poor Evelyn. Did you really think you could outplay me with that pathetic child? Should've gotten rid of the brat when you had the chance.'

...

"Mom. Emily."

A calm, youthful voice crackled from Sophia's necklace pendant.

"Oliver?" Evelyn's breath hitched.

"Signal boost modification," the boy explained tersely. "I've accessed the park's surveillance. Liam's en route to the control room. Five minutes until stabilization. Hold position."

Across the Atlantic, a pale boy with IV lines protruding from his arms monitored twelve live feeds on his hospital bed workstation.

Evelyn's throat tightened. "You should be resting, sweetheart."

A weighted pause.

"You went back for me." Oliver's voice wavered for the first time. "I told you I didn't care about—"

"Don't." Evelyn's whisper broke.

Sophia sniffled against her restraints. "Not your fault, Ollie. I wanted to help. I just... I shouldn't have brought Mom here..."

"Enough!" Liam's panting voice cut in through the pendant. "Oliver—control panel's locked. Two techs inside watching soccer highlights. Two guards smoking by the stairwell."

"Understood." Oliver's tone shifted to clinical precision. "Left terminal controls the Skywheel hydraulics. Distract the guards."

Liam exhaled sharply. A rustling sound followed as he presumably pocketed the necklace.

Then, clear as day, they heard their youngest brother's cheerful pitch:

"Excuse me, sirs! Want to know how to turn a security gig into a six-figure career?"
###Chapter 20

SCREECH!

The deafening sound of tires skidding echoed through the air.

A sleek black Maserati sped through the VIP entrance of the amusement park. The door swung open violently, and a tall, broad-shouldered man stepped out in haste.

"Daniel—!" Serena Hart rushed toward him, her face streaked with tears. She threw herself into his arms, trembling. "It's all my fault! Sophia is still up there! I should never have let that maid take her!"

Her voice cracked with panic. "I warned them the Skywheel wasn't safe, but the maid ignored me. She just wanted to make Sophia happy!"

Daniel Blackwood's jaw tightened, his sharp gaze scanning her face for deception. "How long?"

"Ten minutes." Serena wiped her tears, her breath hitching. "If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive myself! If I had gone with her instead—"

"Enough." His voice was ice. The sound of her sobs grated on his nerves. "Have the technicians fixed it?"

"They're trying, but they don't know what's wrong." She gestured frantically toward the maintenance crew below the ride. "This wasn't supposed to happen!"

Daniel's eyes locked onto the tilted gondola, its door missing. His stomach twisted.

At that angle, anyone inside wouldn't last long.

Sophia—delicate, sweet Sophia—was trapped in that death trap.

His hands clenched.

He had already lost Evelyn once. He wouldn't lose their daughter too.

"Ethan." He shrugged off his jacket, letting it drop to the ground. "I'm going up. Get to the control room—now."

Serena's eyes widened in horror. "Daniel, no! It's too dangerous!"

She couldn't let this happen. Not when they were so close to being rid of them both.

She grabbed his arm, nails digging in. "Let the professionals handle this!"

Daniel turned, his cold stare silencing her. "I wasn't there when Evelyn needed me."

He wouldn't make the same mistake twice.

Wrenching free, he strode toward the Skywheel without another glance back.

"Daniel!"

Serena watched him climb, her lips pressed into a thin line.

This wasn't part of the plan.

"Ms. Hart." One of her bodyguards shifted uneasily. "Should we... call it off?"

Her glare was venomous. "Do you think we have a choice now?"

Everything had been perfect.

The gondola door removed. The angle just steep enough to make escape impossible.

Yet somehow, Evelyn and Sophia were still holding on.

Her fists clenched.

"Tell them," she hissed. "No repairs until they fall."

They couldn't afford survivors.

In the control room, Liam Carter stared at the flickering screens, his small fingers flying over the keyboard. "Oliver, hurry!"

On the other end of the line, his twin's voice remained steady. "Almost there. The system's unlocked, but I've never hacked an amusement park before."

Halfway across the world, Oliver Carter sat in his hospital bed, eyes darting between the manual and the live feed.

Then he saw him—a tall figure scaling the metal framework of the Skywheel.

Black slacks. White shirt. Not a technician, but moving with lethal precision.

"Liam," Oliver murmured. "Who is that?"

Liam scoffed. "Our sperm donor."

Oliver's fingers stilled for a fraction of a second.

Their father.

"Focus," Liam snapped.

Oliver exhaled, typing faster.

A command executed.

The gondola shuddered—then slowly righted itself.

Inside, Evelyn Carter gasped, her arms tightening around Sophia. "We're safe!"

But the little girl in her arms didn't stir.

Evelyn's blood ran cold.
###Chapter 21

Evelyn swiftly turned Sophia over and lifted her chin.

The child's face was ghostly pale, her cheeks devoid of color. Her eyes were shut tight, as if in deep slumber.

As Evelyn moved, the little girl's arm dropped limply to the side—

"Sophia? Sophia!"

A wave of terror crashed over Evelyn as she clutched the child like a madwoman. "Wake up! We're almost safe! Sophia—"

"What happened to her?" A strong hand gripped the edge of the Skywheel car just as Evelyn's knees buckled.

Daniel, drenched in sweat, hauled himself inside.

Exhaustion lined his face, but he didn’t hesitate—he pulled Sophia into his arms, his voice rough with concern. "What's wrong with her?"

Evelyn looked up at him, fury and despair twisting inside her.

"You're asking me?" A bitter, venomous smile curled her lips. "If you hadn’t forced her to bond with Serena, would she be like this?"

Her fingers tightened around Sophia, yanking her back from his grasp. "If she dies today, you won’t walk out of here alive."

A fall from this height would leave nothing of him but shattered remains across the park.

Her glare locked onto his as she advanced, step by deliberate step.

Daniel, still catching his breath from the climb, gripped the railing. "What the hell are you doing?"

"Making sure you pay." Her voice was ice. "If she dies, you die with her."

Six years ago, he and Serena had conspired to kill her and her unborn children. Now, he’d let Serena target Sophia.

This wasn’t an accident. The Skywheel’s failure was planned.

And his presence here? Useless.

"Stop this," Daniel snapped, though his tone softened slightly. "She’s not dead."

"Isn’t she?" Evelyn’s words were razor-sharp. "She was born fragile. Terrified. Do you think a six-year-old could endure this?"

His gaze flicked to Sophia’s still form behind Evelyn.

His stomach dropped.

"No," he muttered, more to himself than to her. "She just passed out."

"Too late for that." Tears spilled down Evelyn’s cheeks as she glared at him.

In his exhausted state, she could overpower him. One push, and it would be over.

She lunged—

"Auntie..."

A weak voice cut through the tension.

Evelyn froze.

Sophia’s small fingers curled around her sleeve. "Stop... please."

Evelyn whirled, gathering the girl into her arms. "Sophia! How do you feel?"

"Not good..." Sophia’s whisper was faint. She tugged Evelyn closer. "Oliver... needs us."

"I know." Evelyn clutched her, tears streaming freely. "I was wrong. I’m sorry. You’re okay..."

In her relief, she forgot Daniel was still there.

He wiped sweat from his brow, watching them with an unreadable expression.

If he didn’t know better, he’d think Evelyn was Sophia’s real mother.

Her fear, her love—it was raw. Real.

No act could fake that.

Master Control Room

From Liam’s necklace, Oliver’s voice came through, tense but steady. "Liam, listen carefully. There’s a joystick to your right. See it?"

"Yeah." Liam exhaled shakily, fingers closing around the controls.

Before he could move, the door burst open.

Ethan stormed in, fury in his eyes.

"What the hell are you doing?!" He grabbed Liam by the collar, hauling him up. "You’re the reason the Skywheel malfunctioned? People could die!"

He hurled Liam onto a nearby couch, then seized the joystick—

And yanked it back violently.

The Skywheel car lurched.

Daniel, standing near the door, lost his footing—

And plummeted into open air.
###Chapter 22

"Daniel!" Serena shot up from her seat, her face draining of color.

His fingers gripped the jagged edge of the Skywheel car door as his body swayed dangerously over the void. Crimson streaks appeared where the metal bit into his flesh.

The crowd below gasped in unison as his entire frame dangled precariously outside the carriage.

Serena whirled toward the security team, her voice sharp with panic. "Fix this now! Immediately!"

This wasn't supposed to happen. Those other women were meant to fall, not Daniel. She'd never intended to harm him, only eliminate the competition.

"Daddy!" Emily's tiny hand stretched toward him desperately before Evelyn pulled her back. "You'll get pulled down with him - you're not strong enough."

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn secured the safety harness around Emily's waist before inching toward Daniel on her knees.

Her palm extended toward him. "Take my hand." He remained motionless.

His knuckles whitened around the metal frame as he smirked, voice dripping with sarcasm. "Changed your mind about killing me?"

Evelyn's face paled.

Her jaw clenched. "This isn't the time for your games. If you want to live, grab my damn hand! Emily still needs her father!"

With that infuriating smirk still playing on his lips, Daniel transferred his weight to her outstretched hand, allowing her to haul him back into the carriage.

From her secured position, Emily watched through tear-filled eyes as Evelyn struggled to pull Daniel to safety.

Maybe... just maybe her parents could learn to love each other.

"Restrain him!"

In the control booth, Liam rose from his chair and signaled to the compromised security guards.

Once Ethan was pinned to the couch, Liam calmly resumed his position and followed Oliver's whispered instructions coming through the communication device.

"You bastard! If anything happens to them—" Ethan's threat was cut short as the guards tightened their grip.

Liam's focus never wavered from the controls as he coldly retorted, "You're the one endangering them."

Under Liam's precise adjustments, the Skywheel carriage gradually leveled out and resumed its normal rotation.

"Crisis averted."

Oliver exhaled sharply before turning his attention back to the surveillance feed.

On screen, Daniel shielded both Evelyn and Emily in his arms, his body tense as he monitored the ride's movements - ready to react should anything go wrong again.

Oliver pushed away from the keyboard, crossing his arms as he studied the man's face intently.

His small fingers reached for the nearby notepad, carefully writing the word 'father' before staring at it with unreadable eyes.

"Oliver."

The nurse entered briskly, confiscating both the laptop and notepad. "Infusion time. Your session is over."

The boy extended his needle-marked arm without protest. "Understood."

As the repaired Skywheel carriage touched down safely, cheers erupted from the gathered crowd.

"Daniel!"
###Chapter 23

Tears streamed down Evelyn's face as she rushed toward Daniel, desperate to feel his embrace. But...

His left arm cradled little Emily while his right supported Sophia. There was no room left for her.

In that moment, Daniel, Sophia, and Emily looked like the perfect family - united and inseparable.

Evelyn froze. The bitterness in her eyes grew like poisonous ivy.

Medical staff quickly loaded Sophia and Emily onto stretchers, wheeling them toward the waiting ambulance.

"Daniel, you terrified me!" Evelyn pressed her face against his chest once the ambulance departed. "I cried until I thought my heart would stop. I believed I'd lost you forever..."

Daniel took a deliberate step back.

"Sir!" Ethan Reynolds arrived breathlessly, his face swollen with bruises. "Thank God you're safe! That kid wasn't lying - he actually saved you!"

Daniel's brow arched slightly. "What kid?" Ethan recounted everything he'd witnessed in the control room.

"He looked about Emily's age. I thought he was causing trouble, but he's the reason you're standing here!"

The towering man frowned. "Where is he now?" "I lost track of him when I came to find you, but..." Ethan gestured toward two subdued security guards nearby. "These men were working with the boy. We detained them."

Daniel studied the guards with cool detachment before approaching.

Seeing him advance, the guards began protesting immediately.

"Sir, we helped save lives! We don't need thanks, but why are we being held?"

"We're park employees! We'll lose our jobs if we don't return to our posts!"

Daniel signaled his bodyguards to release them. "How do you know that boy?"

The guards exchanged glances. "We don't. He paid us two hundred dollars to break into the control room."

"Everyone outside was panicking, but the staff inside were just listening to music! We forced the door while the kid operated the equipment."

"Unbelievable - a child handling such complex machinery!"

"Mr. Blackwood."

A medic interrupted. "Your injuries require hospital treatment."

Blood still seeped from Daniel's palm where the metal had sliced deep...

"Get me the security footage," he ordered, jaw tight. "I want that boy identified."

"And detain the park management. I want a full investigation into this incident."

With that, he turned toward the ambulance.

The guards hesitated. "Sir, what about us—"

"Report to Blackwood Enterprises tomorrow." Daniel didn't bother turning around. "You're unqualified for our standards."

"But I'd suggest thanking that boy tonight. He just changed your futures."

The ambulance doors closed behind him.

The guards stared at each other before scrambling to call Liam, their voices giddy with excitement. "Kid, you were right! We hit the jackpot!"

Blackwood Enterprises!

Even a security position there meant life-changing money and prestige.
###Chapter 24

At the other end of the line, Liam sat on a park bench, his eyes locked onto the retreating ambulance. "Congratulations," he muttered, his voice flat.

Even though Evelyn and Emily had been rescued, guilt still gnawed at him.

He never imagined Serena could be so ruthless toward Emily.

If not for him—if he hadn't pushed Emily to reunite with that worthless Daniel—none of this would have happened.

The thought made his stomach twist.

Unaware of his dark mood, the two security guards excitedly delivered their news. "Because of you, we start at Blackwood Enterprises tomorrow!"

"If you ever need anything, just say the word!"

Blackwood Enterprises? Liam's eyes sharpened.

He needed someone on the inside there.

Grandview Medical Center.

Daniel quietly pushed open the hospital room door. Evelyn turned at the sound, her expression tightening when she saw him.

Noticing Emily asleep in bed, she pressed a finger to her lips and stepped into the hallway.

"How is she?" Daniel kept his voice low.

"The doctor said it was an extreme fear response. She took her meds and fell asleep." Evelyn's gaze flicked to his heavily bandaged hand. "How's your injury?"

"Fine." His eyes locked onto hers. "Thank you."

Regardless of her motives, she had risked her life for Emily. He'd seen it himself.

She deserved his gratitude.

"Don't." Her voice was ice. "I'm just the nanny. This is my job. As her father, you should be investigating who did this, not thanking me."

Daniel cut in, tone measured. "The investigation isn't finished. We can't assume it was intentional. It might have been an accident."

Some part of him refused to believe this was planned.

"An accident?" Evelyn scoffed. "You really believe that? What a convenient accident—the Skywheel malfunctioned the second Emily and I reached the top. The door just happened to break off our carriage."

Her voice dropped to a razor's edge. "And the park's rescue team just happened to be off today. The remaining staff just happened to have no training. So many coincidences. Do you actually buy that?"

Her glare could have frozen hell. "Or—are you protecting whoever wanted your daughter to die?"

Her next words struck like knives. "If I hadn't been with her today, do you know what would've happened? She's six years old."

Each syllable carved deeper into him.

He said nothing, his face unreadable.

That silence broke her.

All day's fury erupted as she slammed her palm against the wall. "If you care more about protecting her than your own child, why bother reuniting with Emily at all?"

Her voice cracked. "If you can't keep her safe, give her back to her real mother."

Daniel's eyes flashed.

In an instant, he had her pinned against the wall, his hand at her throat.
###Chapter 25

Evelyn's back slammed against the unyielding wall, a sharp gasp escaping her lips as pain shot through her.

Daniel's fingers tightened around her throat, his gaze glacial. "You're nothing but a servant trying to win my favor by pretending to care for Emily. Know your place."

"I appreciate what you did today," he continued, voice dripping with venom, "but that doesn't give you the right to meddle in matters between me and my ex-wife. No one speaks to me like that—except for Emily's real mother."

His grip tightened. Evelyn's vision blurred, her face flushing crimson as oxygen fled her lungs.

Just as darkness threatened to consume her, he released her. "Remember your position."

Coughing violently, Evelyn crumpled to the floor, clutching her bruised throat.

"Well, well. What do we have here?" Serena's mocking voice cut through the hallway.

Evelyn looked up.

Serena stood above her, clad in a blood-red dress, her stiletto heels clicking against the marble floor. She smirked, tilting her head. "I knew it. Pretty faces hide rotten hearts. You orchestrated this whole rescue act to manipulate Daniel's gratitude. Clever—but not clever enough."

"Serena," Daniel said sharply, his frown deepening.

The air turned frigid.

"I said," Serena repeated, linking her arm with Daniel's, "this maid planned everything. She wanted you and Emily to owe her. Pathetic, really—using a child for personal gain." She pressed a dramatic hand to her chest. "If anything had happened to Emily today… It still terrifies me to think about it."

"Lies!" Evelyn shoved herself upright, nails biting into her palms.

Serena had the audacity to pin this on her?

"Proof?" Serena pulled out a file, flipping it open. "After the incident, I had a hunch. So I checked the call logs and internet history from Silvercrest Manor." She tapped a highlighted number. "See? This number contacted Evelyn last night. And guess where that same signal appeared today? The Skywheel's control room."

Daniel snatched the file, scanning the pages. His expression darkened.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

That number belonged to Liam.

He'd warned her not to take Emily to the amusement park. When disaster struck, he'd rushed to the control room to help.

But she couldn't say that.

Her fists trembled. Rage burned through her veins, but she stayed silent.

Serena smirked, flipping another page. "And here—Evelyn spent hours last night researching amusement park accidents. Convenient, isn't it?"

Evelyn's jaw clenched.

She'd searched for safety precautions—to protect Emily. But how could she prove it?

"Daniel," Serena sighed, feigning sorrow. "I suspected her from the start. I should’ve acted sooner. This is my fault—"

"Evelyn." Daniel hurled the file at her. The papers struck her chest like a physical blow. "Explain."

Her fingers dug into the wall behind her.

Every piece of evidence was real.

She wanted to lunge at Serena, to make her pay.

But she couldn't.

Losing control now would only convince Daniel she was guilty.

So she stood there, silent, while her world crumbled.
###Chapter 26

Evelyn had to keep her composure.

She inhaled deeply and met Daniel's piercing gaze, her voice quivering slightly. "If I told you I researched potential dangers at the amusement park yesterday because I was worried about Sophia's safety... would you believe me?"

Serena scoffed. "Then explain the phone number."

Evelyn clenched her jaw, fighting back the surge of fury. "That number belongs to a friend. He knew I'd be at the park and wanted to ensure I had backup in case of an emergency."

She held Daniel's stare, willing him to see the truth in her words.

Daniel's brow furrowed. "Call him. I'll verify it myself."

"He won't answer." Evelyn's lips trembled. "I won't submit to baseless accusations, and my friends don't owe anyone explanations for me."

She shut her eyes briefly, then spoke coldly. "Everything I've done—whether it was premeditated or simply to appease Mr. Blackwood—you'd know better than me."

A pause. Then, softer: "To me, Sophia matters more than you ever could."

Daniel's frown deepened, but the memory of Evelyn on the Skywheel flashed through his mind—her raw fury when she thought Sophia was dead. The hatred in her eyes still haunted him.

"Who would believe you?"

Seeing Daniel hesitate, Serena stepped between them, blocking their eye contact.

"You and Sophia aren't even related. Why bother being so kind? Unless you're after Daniel's money and status?" Her lips curled in disdain. "I've seen countless gold-diggers like you, desperate to climb the social ladder."

She was relentless, determined to pin the blame on Evelyn before Daniel could uncover the truth.

But Evelyn wasn't backing down.

She lifted her chin, her voice icy. "You're accusing me based on a phone number and search history? Fine. Then let's examine your call logs and browsing records from the past two days. Fair, don't you think?"

If she was going down, she’d drag Serena with her.

Evelyn turned to Daniel. "Mr. Blackwood, would you help me retrieve her records? I suspect they'll be far more... revealing than mine."

Serena paled.

"You think you can implicate me?" she spat, though panic flickered in her eyes. "I would never hurt Sophia!"

She whirled toward Daniel. "You're not actually considering this, are you? You know I'd never—"

Daniel leaned against the wall, unmoved. He pulled out his phone. "I'll have someone look into—"

Serena snatched it from his hand.

"Daniel!" Her voice cracked. "You can't seriously suspect me! I'm her aunt!"

Evelyn smirked. "If you're innocent, why are you so afraid?"

"I—I'm not!"

"Enough." Daniel's voice cut through the tension. He reclaimed his phone with a sharp tug.

Evelyn pressed on. "You're a smart man, Mr. Blackwood. Her reaction tells you everything, doesn't it?"

Daniel's gaze darkened as he studied Serena. "I will find out who endangered Sophia."

Serena's breath hitched. "You don't trust me?"

He didn't answer.

She grabbed his arm, pleading. "Daniel, I love Sophia. Why would I—"

He pulled away, his tone final. "We'll discuss this later."

"But—"

Daniel turned, his expression unreadable. "And who gave you permission to access Silvercrest Manor's private communications without my authorization?"
###Chapter 27

Serena's face drained of color.

She had only intended to gather evidence to pin everything on Evelyn, forgetting that Silvercrest Manor didn't just contain Evelyn's signals—Daniel's were there too.

"Exactly," Evelyn leaned against the wall, a mocking smile curling at her lips. "Though Mr. Blackwood's phone signals are encrypted, if even one or two were intercepted during your surveillance, and that data somehow leaked… The financial fallout could reach hundreds of millions."

Serena went ghostly white.

"Daniel, I—I would never sell your information! I was just… desperate. I needed proof of Evelyn's scheme, so—"

Watching Serena's frantic expression, Evelyn smirked. But before she could speak, Emily's weak voice drifted from the hospital room.

"Auntie…"

The moment her daughter called, Evelyn abandoned the confrontation and rushed inside.

That left only Daniel and Serena in the hallway.

"Daniel…" Serena pouted, trying to soften his suspicion. "I messed up…"

"Save the apologies," Daniel said coldly. "Once the investigation concludes, and if it aligns with Evelyn's claims—proving you're responsible for today—you know what follows."

With that, he turned and strode into the room.

The door slammed shut behind him.

Serena stood frozen, chest heaving with fury.

Her plan had been flawless—or so she thought. Yet not only had the brat survived, but that wretched maid had outmaneuvered her!

Furious, she kicked the bench with all her strength.

Just you wait.

"Were you fighting outside?"

From her hospital bed, the pale little girl glanced between Evelyn and Daniel. "You were so loud."

"Sorry."

Daniel approached, taking Emily's small hand in his. "Daddy's fault."

"Daddy," Emily forced a weak smile. "Don't make me go with that scary aunt again, okay? I almost died today…"

Daniel's chest tightened at her frail state. "Okay. No more forcing you."

"Yay!" She nodded weakly.

"And Auntie is good. She cares about me most. Don't be mean to her anymore, okay?"

Daniel hesitated, then nodded. "Fine."

"Thank you, Daddy." Emily smiled, still pale. She reached out, clasping Daniel's hand in one of hers and Evelyn's in the other, then pressed their palms together.

"From now on, no more fighting! Love each other!"

Daniel frowned, his gaze flicking to Evelyn. Silent.

His hand was warm, rough—enough to make Evelyn's pulse skip.

She instinctively tried to pull away, but before she could, Daniel's larger hand closed over hers, sandwiching Emily's between them.

"I promise."

After Emily was cleared by the doctors, Daniel carried her all the way home, guilt radiating off him. He even stayed for dinner.

Later, he personally tucked her into bed.

Though Emily had always wanted his attention, his sudden intensity was… overwhelming.

For the first time, apart from bathroom breaks, she hadn't left his arms all evening.

She squirmed slightly. "Daddy… I'm really okay."
###Chapter 28

Sophia lay curled up on her pastel pink bed, blinking those enormous doe eyes at the man with earnest intensity. "You've stayed with me forever today. Shouldn't you be working? Just call Auntie Grace to come tell me a story!"

Daniel Blackwood picked up the storybook with a determined glint. "I can tell you a fantastic story." The little girl's mouth fell open in shock.

"That's a lie! I've heard your stories before!" She tugged at his sleeve insistently. "I want Auntie Grace, Daddy. Go on..."

After relentless pleading, Daniel finally stepped out of her bedroom, his shoulders slumped in visible disappointment.

Evelyn Carter waited silently in the hallway, leaning against the wall as she watched him exit.

The moment the door opened, Daniel's stormy expression locked onto Evelyn before he strode past without a word.

Shaking her head, Evelyn pushed the door open and entered the cozy room.

"Mommy." Sophia immediately scooted closer, whispering conspiratorially, "Don't you think Daddy's acting weirdly nice today? It's like he's scared we'll disappear."

"The only one he's afraid of losing is you." Evelyn gently tucked the squirming child back under the covers. "Whatever feelings I had for him died years ago. The only reason I'm still here is because of you three."

Her fingers brushed through Sophia's hair tenderly. "So... don't expect Mommy to suddenly fall for him again, okay?"

Sophia's lower lip trembled as she ducked her head guiltily. "Okay."

Meanwhile, at a bustling night market in Willowbrook's west district...

Liam Carter perched on a plastic stool, soaking in the vibrant chaos surrounding him. The mingled scents of sizzling meats and laughter-filled conversations sent an unfamiliar thrill through him.

Back overseas, Mommy was always working. Endless days trapped in that sterile mansion with only servants and occasional visits from Godfather Nathan for company. Even their rare outings were nothing like this - no raucous crowds, no sticky tabletops under open skies.

This was living!

"Hey kid, I'm Tyler. This here's Dominic." The two hulking security guards flanked him like mismatched bookends. "We owe our promotions to you! How should we address our little genius?"

Liam frowned. "Just call me Liam."

"Liam?" Tyler made a face. "Too plain for a boss like you."

Dominic nodded enthusiastically. "We should call you Boss! We'll follow you forever!"

Liam nearly choked on his orange juice. "I'm six."

"But you fixed that industrial printer when the tech guys couldn't!" Dominic's eyes shone with admiration. "And got us transferred to Blackwood Corp's main office! Most adults can't pull that off!"

Flushed with pride, Liam raised his glass. "Fine. You're my men now. Work hard at Blackwood Group!"

"Cheers!"

Their glasses clinked - beer for the guards, juice for the boy.

Soon, Tyler slumped over the table, snoring into his arms while Dominic staggered off to the restroom.

Liam watched the lively crowd, contentment warming his chest. This was nice. Perfect, even. Well... almost. If only Mommy and his siblings were here too.

The stool beside him scraped against concrete as someone sat down.

Assuming it was Dominic returning, Liam kept staring ahead. "That story about catching the shoplifter was cool. Got any more?"

Silence.

Then a deep, cultured voice rumbled: "What kind of story would you like to hear?"

That voice—

Liam whirled around.

Daniel Blackwood sat beside him, his piercing gaze locked onto the stunned child.
###Chapter 29

"Why?"

Daniel Blackwood's lips curled into a smirk as he noticed the shock on the little boy's face. "Didn't expect to see me here?"

Liam Carter swallowed hard and nodded. "Yeah... definitely didn't."

How the hell had he found him?

"Guess introductions aren't necessary." Daniel picked up a clean glass and poured himself a beer with effortless grace. "You saved my daughter. So why run?"

"I wasn't running." Liam avoided his gaze, fingers tightening around his glass.

Even though he'd mentally cursed this man a hundred times, having him suddenly appear beside him sent an uncomfortable prickle down his spine.

Daniel chuckled. "Really? Because it sure looks like you were."

Liam cleared his throat. "I prefer to stay anonymous when doing good deeds."

"Anonymous? More like a ghost."

His men had combed through every inch of that amusement park, checked every visitor—yet this kid had vanished without a trace.

Liam sipped his orange juice, silent.

Daniel didn’t press. Instead, he refilled Liam’s glass. "How old are you?"

"Six." Same as Emily.

Daniel studied the boy beside him, something like admiration flickering in his gaze. "How’d you know how to operate the Skywheel?"

Liam shot him a look. "Trade secret."

Daniel smirked. "What if I insist?"

He’d seen the security footage—this kid had beelined straight for the control room after Emily’s accident. When he found the door locked, he’d used the two guards like chess pieces, manipulating them without hesitation.

This kid’s quick thinking and adaptability? Better than most adults.

"Why do you care?" Liam took another sip, masking his unease. "Planning to steal my moves and start playing hero too?"

Daniel actually laughed at that. The kid’s deadpan sarcasm was unexpected.

"You talk like you’re forty."

Way too mature for a six-year-old.

Liam frowned, considering.

"Maybe because my dad’s been dead so long, the weeds on his grave were taller than me before I could walk. Forces you to grow up fast."

He said it with a smile.

Something about the words twisted in Daniel’s chest, but he couldn’t pinpoint why.

He turned, studying the boy—Emily’s age, yet worlds apart in experience. He fumbled for something comforting. "Your dad’s probably watching over you. Like a star."

It sounded stupid even as he said it. Wasn’t that what people told kids in movies?

Liam rolled his eyes. "Seriously? That’s the best you’ve got?"

He shrugged. "If that bastard was up there staring at me, I’d never leave the house at night."

"Disgusting thought."

Daniel blinked. Every time this kid mentioned his father, the venom in his voice was palpable.

Was it the absence? The resentment?

For some reason, he thought of Emily—six years old. Six years without him. Had she felt this way too?

He cleared his throat. "Was it hard? Growing up without him?"

Liam’s lips curled into something sharp. "Nah. The world’s better off without scum like him. Even if I’m his kid, I’d have pushed him off a cliff myself if I had the chance."

Daniel stiffened.

Okay. That was... intense.

The conversation hit a wall.

Liam, sensing the awkwardness, sighed and threw him a bone. "Why’re you asking me this?"

Daniel hesitated. "Just wondering... if a kid like you suddenly got a father, what would you want from him?"

It was an odd question, even to himself. Normally, he didn’t bother with small talk—let alone with children.

But something about this boy pulled at him. Like an itch he couldn’t scratch.
###Chapter 30

Daniel sighed, immediately guessing Oliver's question was about Sophia.
Was this bastard trying to make amends with her?

The boy frowned, recalling Sophia's words.
"Oliver, if you go back to Daddy, what would you want him to do? I wish he'd cook for me like Mommy does. Comb my hair, pick my outfits, and tell me bedtime stories too!"

After a moment's hesitation, Oliver removed the girly hair-combing request.
"I want my father to cook for me, choose my clothes, and read me bedtime stories."

Daniel arched an eyebrow. "You still need bedtime stories?"
This kid was mature enough to tell stories himself.

"Of course I do!" Oliver huffed. "I'm still six! Just because I'm smart, clever, adorable, and good-looking doesn't mean I'm not a child!"

Daniel had no rebuttal for that.
"Fine."

He noted the requests in his phone before signaling Ethan to settle the bill.
Glancing at the darkened sky, Daniel stood. "It's late. Should I take you home?"

Oliver looked at Tyler slumped on the table, then Dominic keeping his distance. "Okay."

In the car, Daniel studied him. "You saved my daughter. I owe you thanks. What would you like?"
"Nothing." Oliver waved dismissively. "Just keep employing my brothers here."

He turned to the window. "But do investigate this thoroughly. Punish those responsible. Be a proper father to your daughter."

The words left Daniel speechless. Who knew a six-year-old could silence him?

The car soon reached Oliver's given address.
After bidding Daniel goodbye, the boy entered the apartment complex—only to slip out moments later.

Crossing the street, he unlocked a different door.
Grace slept soundly in the master bedroom as Oliver tiptoed to his room.

Lying on his bed, he called Liam.
"Turns out the bastard isn't completely hopeless."

From his hospital bed, Liam adjusted his IV drip. "Mommy wouldn't have loved him if he was entirely worthless."
"True," Oliver conceded. Then his voice hardened. "But he's still trash compared to Godfather!"

Silvercrest Manor

Midnight silence enveloped the estate.
Evelyn finally emerged from Sophia's room after hours of soothing.

Though usually composed, tonight's events left the girl trembling.
Only the promise of showing old photos tomorrow had lulled her to sleep.

The album Evelyn mentioned still sat in the attic—if it remained there at all.
Taking a steadying breath, she waited until the house slept before creeping to the study.

Dust choked the attic, undisturbed for years.
Her flashlight beam cut through the grime until it illuminated the album's spine.

Brushing off the cover, Evelyn opened it gently.
Her sixteen-year-old self smiled up from the pages—innocent, untouched by heartbreak.

Fingertips traced the photo as emotions swelled.
This was before Daniel, before learning some hearts stay cold no matter how you love them.

Lost in memories, she barely registered the study door swinging open—
###Chapter 31

Thud!

A towering silhouette materialized in the doorway.

Daniel Blackwood's gaze immediately landed on the woman perched precariously on the stepladder.

Evelyn Carter sat with a photo album balanced on her lap, completely absorbed in its contents.

Her pale yellow nightgown clung to her slender frame, while her cascading curls tumbled freely down to her waist.

The dim lighting accentuated the graceful curve of her bare legs, though the sight was undercut by the childish bunny slippers identical to little Sophia's.

His wandering eyes narrowed.

Was this woman seriously trying to seduce him in his own study at this hour?

After nearly dying earlier today, she still had the audacity for such games?

"Explain yourself," he demanded coldly, striding forward.

Startled from her trance, Evelyn fumbled the album.

She lunged to catch it, losing her balance completely.

Daniel reacted instinctively, arms shooting out to break her fall.

Crash!

They landed in a tangled heap on the hardwood floor.

Evelyn gaped at the man pinned beneath her.

This was the closest she'd been to Daniel since returning.

His chiseled features had hardened over the years, the boyish softness replaced by rugged masculinity.

For a heartbeat, she forgot to breathe.

Daniel inhaled sharply. Her floral scent overwhelmed his senses, stirring something primal.

"Are you planning to move?" His voice came out rougher than intended.

Flushing scarlet, Evelyn scrambled off him, nearly tripping in her haste.

She snatched up the album like a lifeline.

Daniel rose smoothly, watching how she cradled the book. "Well?"

"I—the staff mentioned your late wife's album was in the attic," she stammered. "Sophia wanted to see it."

A flawless excuse.

His brow arched as he extended a hand.

Reluctantly, Evelyn surrendered the album.

Daniel flipped through pages of Evelyn Carter's frozen smiles. "I'd forgotten this existed."

Her lips twisted. "Five years is a long time to remember an ex-wife's belongings."

When she reached for it, he pulled back. "I'll give it to Sophia tomorrow."

Evelyn forced a nod and retreated.

Outside, she exhaled shakily.

Had he noticed anything?

Back in the study, Daniel stared at the closed door, expression unreadable.

The lamp burned all night.

Page after page, he studied the woman who'd haunted him.

Here laughing with friends, there posing regally, elsewhere lost in thought.

This vibrant creature bore little resemblance to the quiet ghost of his memories.

Even in death, she'd been considerate—leaving instructions to care for Serena Hart, the half-sister she'd adored.

His fingers traced a photograph.

"Evelyn," he murmured. "What would you have me do about Serena now?"

Every clue pointed to her involvement in today's incident.

But how could he condemn the person Evelyn had loved most?

Morning light found him still seated there, jaw clenched in torment.

Knock knock.

"Auntie!" Sophia bounded in, clutching Evelyn's sleeve. "You promised!"

Before Evelyn could explain, Daniel appeared in the doorway.

"Sophia. With me."

The child hesitated, looking to Evelyn for reassurance.

"Go on," Evelyn smoothed the girl's sleep-tousled hair. "Your father has the album."

In the study, Sophia gasped at the treasure in her hands.

"Mommy was so pretty!" she squealed, flipping pages excitedly.

Daniel stilled. "She isn't now?"

Sophia shook her head vigorously. "Mommy says she used to be beautiful, but now she's all—" The child made a scary face.

Daniel's grip tightened on his desk.

"Show me," he said hoarsely. "What does your mother look like now?"
###Chapter 32

Evelyn blinked, realizing her slip of the tongue.

She couldn't bring herself to meet Daniel's gaze, turning her face away. "Mommy, right now, she's—"

Her words froze when she spotted Sophia standing at the study entrance.

The little girl's voice died in her throat.

Daniel turned, his displeasure evident as he addressed the woman in the doorway. "Did you need something?"

"Yes."

Evelyn's expression remained blank. "The staff said breakfast is ready. They're wondering when Sophia will be coming down."

"Eat first if you're hungry."

His irritation was palpable. "Sophia and I will join you when we're finished here."

"Understood."

With a polite smile, she turned and left without hesitation.

Once the door closed, Daniel refocused on Sophia. "You were telling me what your mother looks like now?"

Sophia hesitated, then lifted her chin. "Mommy... she's ugly now."

She struggled to recall Evelyn's original appearance. "Her face is covered in scars, always wrapped in bandages. Only her eyes are visible."

A shudder ran through her small frame. "When the bandages come off... the scars are everywhere."

Memories flooded back—nights spent trembling in fear after glimpsing her mother's disfigured face. Liam would hold her close, whispering, "Sophia, she's our mother. The person who loves us most in this world."

Back then, she hadn't understood. But after learning the truth from Oliver, everything became clear.

The man standing before her was responsible for her mother's suffering.

Sophia's gaze turned icy. "Daddy, if Mommy's ugly now... would you still want her?"

Daniel exhaled sharply. "No matter how she looks, she's still my wife."

His hand gently stroked her hair. "Did she send you back alone because of her appearance? Because she was afraid?"

Sophia nodded. "Mommy said she never wants to see you again. If not for me... she'd have nothing to do with you."

Daniel's eyes darkened.

Three years of marriage—he'd been a neglectful husband. She'd loved him passionately, while he'd given nothing in return. Yet he refused to believe she'd betray him, or abandon their unborn child during that storm.

There had to be more to the story.

But with Evelyn hiding behind her scars, and Sophia too young to understand, uncovering the truth felt impossible.

"Next time you speak to her," he said finally, "tell her I have something important to say."

Sophia pressed her lips together, remaining silent.

Recognizing her distress, Daniel lifted her into his arms and carried her downstairs.

In the dining room, Evelyn was texting Liam. She quickly pocketed her phone when they entered.

"Auntie, you should eat too." Sophia placed salad on Evelyn's plate. "You've gotten too thin."

Evelyn smiled, continuing to serve the child. "You need food to grow. Don't worry about me."

Their tender exchange resembled that of mother and daughter, their bond unmistakable.
###Chapter 33

Daniel's brow furrowed as he took in the scene before him.

After breakfast, little Sophia slid off her chair with a bounce. "I'm going to my room!"

The child practically skipped up the staircase, her tiny feet barely touching each step.

Evelyn remained seated, watching the girl's pigtails swing with each movement. A soft sigh escaped her lips.

Children's emotions were like summer storms - intense but fleeting. Already, Sophia seemed to have forgotten yesterday's turmoil.

As Evelyn rose to follow, Daniel's voice stopped her. "Wait."

She turned. "Mr. Blackwood? Did you need something?"

"Yes." He cleared his throat awkwardly. "I want to cook for Sophia."

Last night's conversation with Liam echoed in his mind. The boy's wish for a father who could cook, dress him, and tell bedtime stories.

Though Sophia was a girl, the sentiment remained. He owed her this much after everything.

A week had passed since she came into his life, yet he'd given her nothing - no gifts, no special moments. This would be his first attempt.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "You...want to cook? For Sophia?"

Daniel gave a single firm nod. "Is that a problem?"

"Of course not." She gestured toward the kitchen. "I'll teach you tomato scrambled eggs. Simple, and Sophia loves them."

Given Daniel's privileged background, complex dishes were out of the question.

Without another word, he followed her into the cramped kitchen space.

His broad shoulders seemed to fill the entire room, making the air feel suddenly thick. Evelyn inhaled sharply before opening the refrigerator.

No tomatoes. No eggs.

"We'll need groceries first," she announced, turning toward the door.

Daniel fell into step beside her. "I'll drive. There are other things I'd like to get for Sophia - your input would help."

Resigned, Evelyn accompanied him to the local market.

Pushing a cart behind Daniel's imposing figure, they'd barely entered when a familiar voice caught Evelyn's attention.

Grace was arguing with Liam, who sat regally in another shopping cart like a tiny king holding court.

"Chicken again today! Your godmother makes the best roasted chicken!"

"No! We've had chicken every day this week! And yours isn't even that good!"

Grace was mid-retort when Liam suddenly fell silent, his eyes widening.

Following his gaze, Grace's jaw dropped. "Evelyn?!"
###Chapter 34

"Miss Thornton."

Evelyn flashed Grace a knowing wink, playing the part of casual acquaintances perfectly. "Out for some shopping too?"

Grace's brows knitted together just as Daniel, standing across from her, gave Liam a quick once-over. "Fancy seeing you again."

With Evelyn present, Liam didn't dare speak freely. He offered Daniel an awkward smile instead. "Yeah, small world."

Grace's jaw nearly hit the floor. What fresh madness was this?

Since when was Evelyn Carter chummy with someone like Daniel Blackwood?

And how did Liam know him?

She forced a stiff smile. "Looks like we've got quite the reunion here..."

"Hello there." Daniel finally noticed the woman pushing Liam's shopping cart. "You're this boy's mother?"

Grace blinked. "???"

His actual mother was standing right beside him! "She's not my mom," Liam cut in. "She's my godmother. My real mom's working double shifts and can't take care of me right now, so I'm staying with her."

The boy's words made Grace swallow whatever protest she'd been about to make. Clearing her throat, she exchanged a few stiff pleasantries with Evelyn before hastily steering Liam away.

Daniel's gaze followed them until they disappeared around a corner.

"How'd you meet such a young kid?" Evelyn pushed her cart forward, feigning nonchalance.

"That boy saved you and Sophia yesterday." Daniel exhaled softly. "Remarkable child with a strong moral compass."

"I see..." Evelyn's grip on the cart handle relaxed slightly.

She'd been worried Liam might pull another stunt like reuniting Sophia with Daniel - completely derailing her plans. Another surprise like that might just give her a heart attack.

"He's had a rough go of it," Daniel continued as they walked, noticing Evelyn's interest. "Said his father died when he was born, just him and his mother scraping by. Can't believe she'd pawn him off on a friend like that, even if she is working."

He couldn't explain why, but something about the boy reminded him painfully of Sophia. If he hadn't found his daughter, would she have ended up just as lost and alone?

"He..." Evelyn's knuckles whitened around the cart handle. "Said his father was dead?"

"Yeah." Daniel recalled Liam's words from yesterday. "Claimed the grass on his father's grave was already two meters tall when he was born."

Evelyn turned away abruptly, hiding the flush creeping up her cheeks as she fought back laughter. "We're done here. Should we head home?"

But instead of leaving, Daniel guided her toward the mall's third-floor clothing department.

"I want to get some things for Sophia."

Evelyn nodded and immediately veered toward the children's section. If Daniel wanted to spoil her daughter, who was she to stop him? Sophia would be the one benefiting from new clothes either way.

Like a hummingbird darting between flowers, Evelyn flitted through the racks with practiced ease - plucking a blouse here, a dress there. She knew Sophia's exact measurements and which styles would suit her daughter's vibrant personality best.
###Chapter 35

Daniel Blackwood felt a flicker of surprise.

Had it really been less than a week since Evelyn Carter started caring for Emily?

Yet she already understood the little girl so well.

He leaned back on the sofa, watching her sort through children's outfits with practiced ease. The image of Evelyn's face flashed in his mind—bright, determined, always moving.

If she were still here, she'd be just like Evelyn—buzzing around Emily like a devoted bee, anticipating her every need.

The realization unsettled him.

Evelyn's care for Emily went beyond mere duty. She didn't just tend to the child—she knew her.

Yesterday on the Skywheel, she'd shielded Emily without hesitation, ready to sacrifice herself.

At that moment, Daniel had thought—even if she had ulterior motives, did it matter?

As long as she kept Emily safe.

"Sir?"

A sales associate approached cautiously. "Your wife has excellent taste. Would you like to select something for her as well?"

Daniel's gaze sharpened.

The man flinched but pressed on, gesturing toward the women's section. "She'd look stunning in our new collection."

Against his better judgment, Daniel followed.

He returned with two designer outfits just as Evelyn finished choosing Emily's clothes.

"These are for you."

He handed her the bags in the car, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn blinked. "Mr. Blackwood?"

"Consider it gratitude." His voice was ice. "For saving Emily yesterday. And for the cooking lessons."

He turned toward the window. "I see how much you care for her. But I can't give you what you're after. Take these instead."

Understanding dawned slowly.

He still didn't trust her. Still believed this was all some scheme.

A bitter smile touched her lips. "How generous."

She had returned with plans, yes—but not like this. Never like this.

If not for Liam's meddling, she wouldn't be playing nursemaid in Daniel's home, enduring his suspicion.

The ride home passed in heavy silence.

Emily's delighted shrieks broke the tension. She dragged Evelyn to try on every outfit immediately, demanding praise after each change.

Evelyn laughed, watching the girl twirl. So easily pleased.

Her phone rang during the sixth costume change. Grace's voice crackled with urgency.

"Evelyn! Have you seen the news?"

She massaged her temples. "What now?"

"You and Daniel—shopping together—photos everywhere! Serena Hart's live-streaming her meltdown! The internet's calling you a homewrecker!"
###Chapter 36

The moment Evelyn ended her call with Grace, she immediately opened Twitter.

The trending hashtag #SerenaHartCryingLive dominated the platform.

With a tap, the live stream filled her screen. There sat Serena, tears streaming down her cheeks as she played the victim. "These are all vicious lies," she sobbed dramatically. "Daniel and I share an unbreakable bond. I trust him completely. What you saw wasn't the truth. Please stop spreading these horrible rumors. He must be going through something difficult - he would never betray me like this."

Evelyn's lips curled in disgust at the performance. No wonder Serena had won acting awards. The woman could turn on tears like a faucet.

Daniel would never cheat? Then how exactly had their relationship begun?

"Mommy, what's so interesting?" Emily emerged from the dressing room in her final outfit, noticing Evelyn's dark expression as she stared at her phone.

Evelyn quickly locked her screen. "Nothing important, sweetheart."

She knelt to admire her daughter's sunflower-yellow top paired with whimsical overalls. "You look absolutely adorable."

Emily's attention instantly shifted. Twirling before the mirror, she beamed. "Daddy has amazing taste!"

A bittersweet smile touched Evelyn's lips. She couldn't bring herself to reveal she'd actually selected every piece.

When they exited the dressing area, Evelyn's gaze fell on the two elegant outfits Daniel had chosen for her.

A sharp pang struck her heart. For three long years, she'd loved Daniel with every fiber of her being.

Not once in those years had he ever noticed her, let alone bought her clothes. Now, as merely Emily's caretaker, she received more consideration than she'd ever dared hope for as his wife.

The painful truth crystallized - his coldness toward her had been deliberate.

Shaking off the thought, she settled Emily before heading to the kitchen. Grace's message buzzed in her pocket: [Evelyn, have you decided how to handle this? Regular people like us get crushed in internet wars!]

Her reply was calm: [I have a plan. Don't worry.]

Pocketing her phone, she tied on an apron and turned to Daniel, who sat absorbed in documents. "Mr. Blackwood, shall we begin?"

Daniel rose with a frown, his imposing frame dwarfing the modest kitchen space as he stood beside her.

Evelyn began demonstrating basic techniques with practiced ease, but noticed Daniel staring intently at her profile.

His gaze held an intensity he'd never shown Evelyn Carter before. Back then, he'd barely glanced her way.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice turned icy.

He blinked, clearing his throat. "Yes?"

"Shall we proceed to the next step?"
###Chapter 37

Evelyn offered Daniel a soft smile as she handed him the ceramic mixing bowl.
"Whisk these eggs."

Daniel's lips pressed into a thin line as he accepted them.
When their fingers brushed, Evelyn jerked her hand back like she'd been burned.

"Mr. Blackwood." She gestured to the kitchen island. "Let's keep ingredients here. It's better if you take them directly from the counter."

Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Considering you're engaged, frequent physical contact seems... inappropriate."

Daniel's brow furrowed. What was wrong with her today?
Physical contact? They'd barely touched.

Under his questioning stare, Evelyn maintained her polite distance while demonstrating the recipe steps.

An hour later, Emily bounded downstairs, eyes widening at the spread. "Daddy cooked? I want extra!"

The child's delight warmed Daniel's chest. As he served Emily, he offered Evelyn a portion. "Try it."

Evelyn's smile tightened. She transferred Daniel's serving to Emily's plate before taking a fresh portion for herself.

The deliberate avoidance made Daniel's jaw tense. Even Emily sensed the shift, glancing between them with confusion.

An uncomfortable silence settled over the dining table.

After lunch, Emily dragged Evelyn upstairs for naptime while Daniel retreated to his office.

"Sir!" His assistant intercepted him at the elevator. "Mrs. Blackwood and Ms. Hart are waiting. They saw the trending videos."

Daniel's steps faltered. "What videos?"

The assistant swallowed hard. "Footage of you grocery shopping with... the housekeeper. The internet thinks you're cheating on Serena."

Daniel snatched the phone, stomach dropping at the headlines.

"Daniel Blackwood!" Eleanor's cane thundered against the floor from inside his office. "Get in here!"

He returned the phone with a terse order for tea before facing the storm.

Eleanor occupied his chair like a displeased monarch, Serena sniffling behind her with red-rimmed eyes.

"Grandmother." Daniel kept his tone even. "To what do I owe this visit?"

Eleanor's cane struck the floor again. "Don't play dumb! Five years Serena's waited for you, and this is how you repay her? Flaunting some maid in public?"

Daniel set down the tea service. "She was merely assisting with errands."

"Since when do you run errands?" Eleanor scoffed. "Not one young servant in your household since Evelyn died, and suddenly this girl appears? Fire her immediately!"

Serena dabbed her eyes. "The entire fashion industry is laughing at me, Daniel..."

Daniel's fingers curled into fists. The trap was closing.
###Chapter 38

"She did nothing wrong."

"Causing trouble for her superiors is the ultimate offense!"

Daniel Blackwood's voice remained steady as he frowned. "She hasn't caused me any trouble."

Eleanor Blackwood slammed her cane against the floor. "She's disrupted Serena! Serena is the future lady of Silvercrest Manor—her rightful mistress!"

Daniel turned his icy gaze toward Serena. "Do you share this opinion?"

Serena's face paled. She bit her lip, feigning distress as she stepped back. "I've explained to Grandmother countless times... Those are just baseless rumors online. We shouldn't act on speculation—"

"Speculation?" Eleanor's glare sharpened. "Should I wait until that maid gets her claws into you? Until she's carrying your child before we take action?"

Her cane struck the floor again as she leveled Daniel with a frigid stare. "One last chance. Will you dismiss her or not?"

"No."

Eleanor's lips curled. "Then give me one valid reason she must stay. If it's justified, I'll relent. Otherwise, you're clearly bewitched by that woman."

Daniel's jaw tightened. "I have my reasons. Just not now."

He needed the right moment for Sophia to be formally acknowledged by the family—not as some sudden reappearance, but with the dignity she deserved. Eleanor's upcoming birthday banquet would be perfect.

But he couldn't reveal it yet. Eleanor couldn't keep secrets. The entire Blackwood clan would know within hours, complicating everything.

"Reasons you won't state are no reasons at all!" Eleanor's cane cracked against the marble. "I don't care about your schemes. Either remove that woman or set a wedding date with Serena immediately! Five years engaged, and you humiliate her with a maid?"

Daniel's voice dropped to subzero. "The maid stays. The wedding won't happen. Push me, and I'll dissolve the engagement right now."

Silence swallowed the room.

Eleanor gaped. "You wouldn't dare."

"I dare anything."

"Fine!" Her face drained of color. "Keep your harlot. But don't expect my blessing—or attendance at my birthday!" She stormed out, her butler scrambling after her.

"Daniel..." Serena approached, fingers brushing his sleeve. "I tried reasoning with her—"

"Did you?" His laugh held no warmth. "An eighty-year-old who barely checks her email. Yet by afternoon, she's seen morning gossip about me and Grace at the mall? Remarkable timing."

Serena stiffened. "You're accusing me?"

"Call it... skepticism." He sat, his stare glacial. "I intended to wait until the banquet to end our engagement publicly. Fewer explanations needed with witnesses. But perhaps today works better."

Panic flashed in Serena's eyes. "The photos just surfaced! Ending it now makes it seem like you're leaving me for her."

Daniel smirked. "Do I look like I care?"

"What about Evelyn?" The name slipped out desperately. "Would she approve?"

His fingers stilled.

Seeing his hesitation, Serena pressed on. "Evelyn's will asked you to marry me. If she sent Sophia back, she's watching. If she thinks you left me for a maid... would she ever return to you?"

Evelyn's face flickered in his mind—her trusting eyes, the one person he'd failed. His throat tightened.

"Daniel," Serena softened her tone, pouring tea. "I won't fight the breakup. But not now. Agreed?"

The cup steamed between them, the silence heavier than any answer.
###Chapter 39

Daniel didn't even glance up.

"Get out," he said coldly. "I need space."

"Fine." Serena exhaled sharply before storming out of the office.

Outside, in the hallway near the CEO's suite, Tyler and Dominic were on their break. They quickly dialed Liam.

"Boss, you won't believe what just happened," Tyler whispered. "Eleanor Blackwood barged into Mr. Blackwood's office and caused a scene. She even mentioned calling off the engagement!"

Liam's voice sharpened with interest. "What else?"

"We didn't catch everything, but after she left, Serena and Mr. Blackwood were arguing about breaking it off. Looks like they're done for."

"Perfect." Liam grinned. After praising the two bodyguards, he hung up.

He paced excitedly around Silvercrest Manor before impulsively ordering an extravagant feast.

An hour later, Grace stared at the lavish spread in disbelief. "Where did you get the money for this?"

Liam shrugged. "Online trolling."

Grace frowned. "You're a troll now?"

"Yep." He smirked. "Oliver and I took a job spreading rumors this morning." Then, he transferred the earnings to Evelyn.

(When I realized Serena was plotting something, I had Oliver set up a troll network. We're making money off her. Here's the payment and proof she hired us. Take a look.)

Evelyn scanned the transaction details on her phone—multiple payments from Serena for smear campaigns. She sighed.

(So you two helped spread lies about me?)

(Mom, don't see it like that.)

Liam panicked, thinking she was upset. He set down his fork and typed frantically. (Serena paid someone to take compromising photos of you. She was going to hire hackers anyway. At least this way, we control the narrative—and profit from it. I know money isn't an issue for you, but why let her waste hers? Sometimes you have to play dirty to win.)

His fingers flew across the screen. (If you're really against it, we'll shut it down right now!)

At Silvercrest Manor, Evelyn lounged on the balcony, the sea breeze tousling her hair.

After a pause, she smiled.

(I'm not angry. I'm impressed.)

The online hate didn't faze her. Six years ago, Serena and Daniel had destroyed her reputation with far worse—accusing her of cheating and driving her to suicide. Compared to that, this was nothing.

Maybe Liam and Oliver understood that. Maybe that's why they didn't hesitate.

(Mom, as long as you're okay with it.)

Liam finally relaxed.

(But Serena sent another payment. She wants the rumors to keep trending. Should we?)

(Do it.)

Evelyn's eyes glinted. (If she wants chaos, give her chaos.)

Daniel wasn't a fool. Sooner or later, he'd uncover the truth. And when he did, Serena's smug facade would crumble.

Evelyn wanted to see if he'd still love her then.

(Got it, Mom. We'll be careful. If it gets to be too much, just say the word, and we'll stop.)

(Okay.)

As the conversation ended, Evelyn leaned back, watching the swaying trees. She exhaled slowly, the weight of the past mingling with the promise of revenge.
###Chapter 40

Evelyn's phone buzzed again.
She glanced at the screen. Nathan Pierce's name flashed across it. Frowning, she answered.

"Nathan." His deep voice resonated through the receiver. "I saw the news in Willowbrook."

A heavy sigh followed. "Why did you become Daniel Blackwood's maid?"

Evelyn shrugged, though he couldn't see it. "It's complicated."

Before returning to the country, she had meticulously planned ways to get close to Daniel.

But Liam had already sent Emily to Daniel's side before she could act. Becoming his maid was her only option.

Everything had veered off course from her original plans. Yet, she could still adapt.

"I noticed Daniel's team is handling the online rumors," Nathan said, his tone serious. "But whoever's behind them is formidable. His people are struggling. Do you need my help?"

Evelyn exhaled softly. "No."

Six years ago, Nathan had pulled her from the sea, saving her and her three children. She'd already burdened him enough.

This revenge was hers alone.

Nathan understood. Silence stretched between them before he finally spoke. "I just don't want to see you hurt again."

"I'm used to it," she replied, deftly changing the subject. "How's Oliver doing?"

"Great." A chuckle escaped him. "I think he's addicted to hacking. Spends all day glued to his computer. Don't worry—I'm keeping an eye on him."

Blackwood Enterprises Tower.

The office air was thick with tension.

Daniel scowled at the video looping on his screen—the one of him and Evelyn shopping. Despite his resources, it kept spreading like wildfire.

Ethan wiped his brow discreetly. "Sir, we can't delete it. The video's encrypted with a virus. Our team can't crack it."

Daniel's eyes narrowed. Unbreakable?

Blackwood employed top-tier programmers. If they couldn't stop it...

He yanked the keyboard toward him and began typing furiously. Within minutes, he traced the source to a remote computer.

Years ago, when he was with Evelyn Carter, she'd been obsessed with hacker films. She'd gushed about their skill and charm, while he'd scoffed.

Still, he'd secretly studied hacking to impress her. But before he could show off, she vanished.

Now, after six years of rust, his fingers flew across the keys. He breached the first firewall effortlessly.

Across the ocean, in a hospital room, an alarm blared.

Oliver jolted awake and lunged for his laptop.

His firewall had been breached.

Teeth gritted, he reinforced his defenses. His opponent was skilled—more than anyone he'd faced before.

Sweat beaded on his forehead as he typed furiously. This was a real challenge.

Daniel leaned back, coldly observing the screen. "Ethan, coffee."

The hacker had noticed him and was fighting back hard.

Good. He wanted to see who dared target him.
###Chapter 41

Ethan entered with two steaming cups just as Daniel's fingers flew across the keyboard in a furious rhythm.

The lines of code flashing on the screen might as well have been hieroglyphics to Ethan.

He set one cup down carefully. "Sir, it's been years since you've personally handled cybersecurity matters."

Daniel gave a curt nod and grabbed the coffee. He drained it in one scalding gulp.

No one had challenged his skills like this in over a decade. The last time he'd felt this level of rage was... he couldn't even remember.

The empty cup hit the desk with a sharp clink as Daniel's fingers resumed their assault on the keyboard.

Meanwhile, across the ocean, Oliver's forehead glistened with sweat as he fought through the fifth firewall layer. He'd known his opponent was skilled, but this? This was something else entirely.

Hacking had always been his pride, yet now he could barely maintain his defenses against this relentless attack.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The emergency alerts blared as his system warned of an impending breach—not just his IP address, but his camera and microphone were being targeted.

With a final desperate swipe, Oliver initiated a complete system wipe just as the hacker's fingers closed around his digital throat.

The screen went dark.

Daniel's fist came down hard on the desk when the connection severed. "Damn it!"

He'd been milliseconds away from uncovering his adversary's identity. Instead, all he got was the bitter taste of scorched earth tactics—the coward had nuked his own system.

In a sterile hospital room thousands of miles away, Oliver gasped for air like a drowning man. Every file, every byte of data—gone.

The blonde nurse peeked in, concern etching her features. "Oliver? That alarm was—"

"I need air," he interrupted in flawless German, his small hands gripping the laptop. "Take me to the café. The one two blocks east."

She hesitated. "Mr. Pierce expressly—"

"Please." The word carried the weight of a child who'd seen too much. Those wide, knowing eyes always got him what he wanted.

"...One hour," she conceded, wheeling him out into the golden afternoon.

The café's lemonade couldn't wash away the metallic fear in his mouth. As his rebooted laptop flickered to life, a single file remained amidst the digital ashes.

His blood ran cold at the message blinking ominously:

[Next time, I won't miss. - Daniel Blackwood]
###Chapter 42

Just because Daniel couldn't find him, he thought threats would work?

Oliver smirked as he plugged his external drive into the laptop. Within moments, an anonymous email was on its way to Daniel's inbox.

The notification pinged. Daniel opened the attachment to find nothing but a silent video clip.

There sat Serena, oversized sunglasses perched on her nose, staring intently at lines of code. Her brows knitted together in concentration.

Then suddenly - realization struck. Her fingers flew across the keyboard in rapid-fire succession, attempting decryption.

"Wait..." Ethan blinked at the screen. "Sir, are you saying Ms. Hart was the hacker?"

"Impossible." Daniel took a measured sip of coffee. "She barely knows basic computer skills. Besides, those weren't actual decryption methods. The hacker I faced was professional. This can't be her."

Ethan nodded along, though confusion still clouded his features.

"Let's pay Serena a visit." Daniel set down his mug with finality, already striding toward the door.

Ethan scrambled after him. "But sir, didn't you just say it wasn't her? Why—"

"Look closer," Daniel cut in, jabbing the elevator button. "That footage was never made public. Either she staged it for attention, or someone hacked her surveillance."

Realization dawned on Ethan. "You think they breached Ms. Hart's system?"

"Worse." The elevator doors slid shut, shadows crossing Daniel's face. "Whoever sent this is sending a message. Serena's involved somehow."

"Brilliant deduction, sir."

"Fetch Evelyn. We'll go together." Daniel massaged his temples. She deserved answers after everything.

Meanwhile, at Serena's penthouse...

The socialite lounged in silk pajamas, sipping tea while scrolling through hate comments targeting Evelyn with her manager.

[Gold-digging trash! Know your place!]
[Homewreckers deserve to rot!]
[Why hasn't Mr. Blackwood fired that maid yet?]

"Perfect." Serena's manicured nail tapped the last comment. "Amplify this one. I want ten thousand comments just like it."

She slammed her platinum card on the marble table. "Money's no object. That pathetic servant needs to learn her place."

The manager hesitated. "One thousand or ten thousand, Ms. Hart?"

"Ten! And make them vicious!" Serena's lips curled. "I want her crushed beyond recovery."

Just as the manager reached for her phone, the doorbell chimed.

"Finally!" Serena stretched lazily. Her celebratory feast had arrived.

"I'll get it!" The manager hurried to the door—only to freeze at the unexpected visitors.
###Chapter 43

"Mr. Blackwood!"

The manager's voice wavered as she faced the man whose presence alone commanded the room. She raised her volume, hoping to alert Serena inside, but Serena was too absorbed in scrolling through online gossip to notice.

"Is Serena here?" Daniel's icy gaze swept past the manager as he stepped inside.

Behind him, Evelyn studied the small apartment with quiet intensity. Memories flooded her mind.

"Evelyn, thank you for this place! It's perfect!"

"You’re amazing! I thought you’d forget about me after your wedding!"

"Evelyn..."

The image of Serena twirling around the apartment, giddy with excitement, flashed before her. She never expected Serena to still be living here after all these years.

Back then, when Evelyn had just married Daniel, she’d used her design earnings to buy this apartment, hoping Serena would move to Willowbrook to keep her company.

Instead, she’d been met with betrayal and manipulation.

"Evelyn, come on." Ethan’s voice snapped her back to reality.

She pressed her lips together and followed Daniel inside.

"Stop!" The manager recognized Evelyn instantly—the woman seen shopping with Daniel. That flawless face was unforgettable.

She blocked Evelyn’s path. "You can’t go in."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why not?"

"As a maid, you should know Mr. Blackwood is Serena’s fiancé. She’s still upset about today. He’s here to comfort her. Your presence will only make things worse."

Evelyn smiled. "If you think he’s here to cheer her up, how do you know he didn’t bring me to apologize?"

"You’re not the type to apologize!" The manager squared her shoulders. "Don’t think I don’t know you’ve been trying to sabotage their relationship from the start!"

Ethan frowned, ready to intervene, but a glance at Daniel stopped him. The man was watching Evelyn with an intrigued expression, as if waiting to see what she’d do next.

Ethan swallowed his words.

Evelyn tilted her head. "If you think I’m trying to break them up, then why are you so desperate to keep me out? Seems like Serena isn’t as secure in their relationship as you claim."

The manager’s face darkened. "Don’t flatter yourself! You’re nothing compared to Serena!"

"Then why are you so afraid of me entering?" Evelyn stepped around her. "What exactly are you worried I’ll do?"

The manager faltered, speechless.

By the time she recovered, Evelyn had already slipped past her and entered Serena’s room.

"Is that my food?"

Hearing the door close, Serena set down her mouse. Before she could turn, her manager’s panicked voice rang out—

"Serena! Mr. Blackwood is here!"

Daniel’s here?!

Serena’s blood ran cold. Her screen displayed all the evidence of her schemes against Evelyn. There was no time to delete it.

Footsteps approached.

In desperation, she slammed the laptop shut.
###Chapter 44

The screen had just gone dark when Daniel appeared in the doorway.

"Daniel." Serena rose abruptly, her smile strained. She positioned herself protectively in front of the computer.

"What brings you here so unexpectedly?"

Daniel's brow furrowed slightly. His gaze shifted to Ethan. "Power it back on."

Serena moved to block Ethan's path. "Why would you need to access my private files?" Her voice carried forced lightness as she turned to her manager. "Would you mind escorting our guests downstairs for tea?" The tremor in her words betrayed her.

Daniel remained unmoved by the doorway. "Tea won't be necessary. Either Ethan turns it on, or you do."

Her fists clenched. His sudden arrival left no time to prepare.

The computer held everything - her correspondence with the hired trolls, the surveillance photos of Daniel and Evelyn shopping together.

If he saw those...

"Could Ms. Hart be concealing something interesting?"

A cool female voice cut through the tension. Serena's head snapped up.

Evelyn stood beside Daniel - the very maid Serena had orchestrated the online smear campaign against.

Why was she here?

Though Serena had fabricated the rumors about Daniel and the maid, she knew better than anyone that Evelyn Carter held his heart.

He'd never shown interest in the maid before. Why bring her now?

Dread coiled in Serena's stomach.

"Ethan." Daniel's voice turned glacial.

Ethan maneuvered around Serena and booted up the system. "Sir, I've found something."

Daniel's piercing stare locked onto Serena as he approached.

Exactly as predicted. The screen displayed meticulous plans for that morning's orchestrated scandal.

A humorless chuckle escaped Daniel. The sudden drop in temperature could've frozen the room solid.

Serena's face drained of color.

Evelyn observed from the doorway, arms crossed. She'd been tending to Emily when Ethan summoned her, claiming Daniel wanted her presence at Serena's.

She'd assumed the madman wanted her to apologize.

Instead, he'd brought her to witness Serena's downfall firsthand.

Evelyn knew Daniel would uncover the truth eventually - just not this swiftly.

Less than twenty-four hours, and he'd pieced together the entire scheme. Now here he stood in Serena's home, collecting damning evidence.

The man's intellect surpassed her estimations.

After reviewing the files, Daniel settled into a chair with lethal grace. His crossed legs and icy stare pinned Serena in place.

"Explain."

Serena's teeth worried her lower lip. Then inspiration struck. She called her manager inside.

Crack!

Her palm connected violently with the manager's cheek, sending the woman sprawling.

"What in God's name are you playing at?" Serena shrieked. "I explicitly told you to handle this discreetly from home! When I saw those fabricated headlines today, I knew they had to be your doing!" Her finger jabbed accusingly. "How dare you betray me like this!"
###Chapter 45

The slap left the manager utterly stunned.

She collapsed onto the floor, staring blankly at Serena. "Serena, you're the one who ordered me to do this!" Her voice trembled with disbelief. "Why am I suddenly the villain here?"

"Since when did I ever give you such instructions?" Serena's hand struck again, the sharp sound echoing through the room. "I specifically told you not to escalate this! Yet you went behind my back!"

Tears welled in Serena's eyes as she turned to Daniel. "Daniel, Evelyn, I'm so sorry for failing to control my manager. You have every right to despise me. I'll accept whatever consequences come my way."

She wiped her tears dramatically. "Thank you for exposing her. If you hadn't arrived when you did, I'd never have known she was using my computer for such despicable acts!"

Evelyn barely suppressed a scoff at the pathetic performance.

Daniel's brow furrowed slightly. "You truly had no idea she was using your computer this way?"

"Of course not!" Serena clutched her chest as if wounded. "You know I'm technologically hopeless. That computer might as well be a paperweight—I only use it for emails!"

"Daniel, please." Serena inhaled shakily, her gaze pleading. "I'll have the company terminate her immediately."

The manager shot to her feet, finger jabbing at Serena. "You ungrateful witch! I built your career from nothing! Now you're throwing me under the bus? Every scandal was your idea! Every headline came from your scheming mind!"

She whirled toward Daniel. "Mr. Blackwood, I swear I didn't—"

"If not you, then who? Me?" Serena delivered a vicious kick, sending the woman sprawling.

Clutching Daniel's sleeve, Serena whispered brokenly, "We've known each other for years, Daniel. You know my character. I'd never exploit our connection for publicity. I don't need cheap tricks to stay relevant..."

The lies would've been convincing—if not for the damning evidence Evelyn possessed. Neil's transaction records clearly showed payments originating from Serena's personal account.

A knowing smile curved Evelyn's lips as she helped the manager up. "Just one question."

The woman blinked up at her warily.

"Do you have access to Ms. Hart's bank account passwords?"

The manager paled, clearly anticipating accusations of embezzlement. "N-no! Never!"

"Excellent." Evelyn turned to Daniel. "Mr. Blackwood, I suggest verifying the payment trail. If the transfers came from the management company or this woman's account, she's guilty. But if they originated from Ms. Hart's personal funds..."

Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Then at minimum, she was complicit."

Daniel shook off Serena's grasp like she was contaminated. "Ethan."

"Already on it!" Ethan vanished through the doorway.

The venomous glare Serena shot Evelyn could've melted steel. This meddlesome bitch would pay—but first, she needed damage control.

Fresh tears spilled as Serena sniffled. "Daniel, before you arrived, we were already fighting about this very issue..."
###Chapter 46

"The fight started because she hacked into my bank account and stole my money."

Serena lowered her gaze, voice trembling with hurt. "I didn't want to tell you at first. It's humiliating. I only gave her my password because I thought she needed help. I never imagined she'd betray me like this..."

Her nails dug into her palms. "But now Evelyn's using this to question my innocence? I'm devastated. I knew nothing! I was just trying to be kind by sharing my resources, and now I'm being punished for it!"

"Lies!" The manager's face flushed crimson. "I never had your password!"

Serena's laugh was razor-sharp. "Admit it and you'll face criminal charges. Wire fraud carries a ten-year sentence."

The woman's mouth opened and closed like a stranded fish.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "How convenient that you're completely blameless, Ms. Hart. Though frankly, you needn't bother defending yourself. Given how Daniel dotes on you, even if you orchestrated this, he'd never hold you accountable."

"I. Did. Not. Do. This!" Serena's scream cracked the air. "Why should I take responsibility for crimes I didn't commit?"

The shouting match escalated until Daniel massaged his temples from the sofa.

"Evelyn." His voice sliced through the chaos. "Enough."

The command froze Evelyn mid-sentence. After a beat, her lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Of course."

Naturally. Serena would always be his priority. Whether she arranged paparazzi ambushes or spread malicious rumors that got Evelyn crucified online - forgiveness came effortlessly. Evelyn could be publicly shamed by millions, but the moment she raised her voice to Serena, she was silenced.

The irony burned. Though she was the one being reprimanded, the real victim was Daniel - CEO of Blackwood Enterprises, whose reputation was taking the hit. Yet his only concern was protecting Serena.

If this wasn't love, what was?

This was how she'd lost to Serena last time too. Privilege bred audacity.

The air grew thick with tension.

The apartment door swung open. Ethan entered clutching a dossier, hesitating when he saw Daniel.

Serena seized the moment to slap her manager again. "Happy now? Your schemes have ruined my credibility!"

Ignoring the theatrics, Daniel snatched the folder. "Well?"

"Forensic accounting confirms it." Ethan's gaze darted between Daniel and Serena. "The payment originated from... Ms. Hart's manager's corporate account."

The revelation stunned the room.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. This didn't add up. Liam's records clearly showed Serena's personal account. How did it suddenly become a company transaction?
###Chapter 47

The revelation didn't just stun Evelyn. Serena was equally shocked.

How? She had personally transferred the money from her own account to the scammers. How did it suddenly become the company's funds?

But now wasn't the time to dwell on that.

Serena quickly composed herself. She spun around and delivered another sharp slap to her manager's face. "At least you still have some conscience left! Thank goodness you used the company account—otherwise, I'd never be able to prove my innocence!"

Finally catching on, the manager had no choice but to play along. "Of course I wouldn't involve your personal account in something like this..."

A smug smirk curled Serena's lips as she turned to Evelyn. "Does this satisfy you now?"

Evelyn frowned, her gaze flickering between them. Something wasn't right. Liam would never give her false records.

Her eyes slowly shifted to Daniel standing nearby.

If it wasn't Liam, then it had to be Daniel. He must have instructed Ethan to claim the transactions were made through the company.

This entire charade was just to clear Serena's name.

"Since the matter is settled," Daniel said coldly, his expression unreadable, "tell the scammers to stop immediately."

The manager and Serena exchanged a glance.

With trembling hands, the manager picked up Serena's spare phone from the table and dialed.

"Shut everything down," she ordered.

"Why?" The voice on the other end sounded annoyed. "We haven't fulfilled Ms. Hart's request yet—"

Hearing them mention Serena, the manager quickly covered the speaker, her face paling. "Just do as I say! No more questions!"

She hung up abruptly and set the phone down. "It's done, Mr. Blackwood."

Daniel's gaze lingered on the phone for a moment.

Serena quickly moved to block his view. "Daniel, don't worry. I'll report this to the board. This irresponsible manager will be fired immediately."

"Not irresponsible," Evelyn cut in, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Just too responsible."

Everything made sense now.

Daniel hadn't brought her here to expose Serena. He'd orchestrated this whole scene to protect her.

He'd pretended to confront Serena, but his real goal was to show Evelyn just how far he'd go for the woman he loved.

Pathetic.

She checked her watch. "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Hart, Emily will be waking up from her nap soon. I should go."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked out, not sparing either of them another glance.

Behind her, Serena's lips curled in triumph.
###Chapter 48

The records showed the company's account instead of hers. Evelyn didn't understand why, but it didn't matter. She had won.

Serena was just a lowly maid. How dare she challenge her? The girl had clearly overestimated herself.

"Evelyn." Daniel's deep voice snapped her back to reality.

She quickly masked the triumph in her eyes, softening her expression as she turned to him. "Yes, Daniel?"

His response was ice-cold.

After a long pause, his sharp gaze locked onto hers. "Don't let this happen again. Watch yourself."

With that, he strode away. Ethan lingered for a moment, his eyes boring into Evelyn before following.

Back in the car, Daniel leaned against the leather seat, rubbing his temples.

"Ethan."

"Yes, sir?"

"How long have you worked for me?"

Ethan hesitated before starting the engine. "Six years, sir."

Daniel exhaled, eyes still closed. "You have a fiancée, don't you?"

A small smile tugged at Ethan's lips. "Yes. We met in university. Been together eight years now. We're planning the wedding."

"Then she's not just your girlfriend anymore."

Daniel's voice turned dangerous. "Does she know... how much you care for Evelyn?"

The car swerved violently.

Ethan pulled over, his face pale as he met Daniel's gaze in the rearview mirror. "Sir, I—"

"Was it really the company that transferred the money?"

Daniel still hadn't opened his eyes, but his words struck like a hammer.

Ethan clenched his jaw. There was no hiding it now. "I'm sorry. Let me explain."

Daniel finally looked at him, his piercing stare making Ethan's blood run cold.

"I only helped Ms. Hart because I felt sorry for her."

"Sorry for her?"

"She's your fiancée." Ethan swallowed hard. "If she weren't desperate, why would she go after a maid? Why resort to spreading rumors?"

Daniel smirked. "Her paranoia is her own doing."

"Sir, you don't give her any security."

Ethan braced himself. "And... ever since Sophia came back to Silvercrest Manor and Evelyn started caring for her, your attitude toward Ms. Hart has changed completely."

He hesitated before adding, "Sometimes, it seems like you treat Evelyn—a maid you barely know—better than your own fiancée."

A beat of silence.

"None of the other maids at Silvercrest have ever gotten this kind of attention from you."

Daniel arched a brow. "Is that so?"
###Chapter 49

Daniel's curt nod was all the confirmation Ethan needed.

"You've worked with Ms. Carter for years, yet never once bought her clothes. But today, you handpicked two outfits for Evelyn."

Ethan hesitated before continuing. "No servant in Blackwood Estate would dare defy you—except her. She's contradicted you repeatedly, yet you haven't dismissed her. And—"

"Enough." Daniel's voice turned glacial as he cut him off. "I'll maintain proper boundaries from now on."

Leaning back, he closed his eyes with finality.

"Ethan, this is your first mistake in all your years serving me. Consider it forgiven—but don't repeat it."

Relief flashed across Ethan's face. "Then you're letting it go?"

He meant Serena.

A humorless smirk curved Daniel's lips. "I have my own plans."

The Skywheel incident report wasn't ready yet. He couldn't prove Serena's involvement, but he wouldn't forget that morning's events so easily.

"But—" Ethan started, only to freeze when Daniel's eyes snapped open.

The atmosphere plunged below freezing. Ethan immediately silenced himself and started the car.

Evelyn had been in a foul mood since returning from Serena's apartment. Even little Sophia noticed her uncharacteristic gloom.

"Auntie, can you bake cookies? Cookies make everything better!"

Clutching her stuffed bunny on the sofa, Sophia peered up with round, cautious eyes.

With a soft sigh, Evelyn ruffled her hair. "Alright, sweetheart. I'll make some now."

She retreated to the kitchen, grateful for the distraction. Keeping her hands busy helped quiet her turbulent thoughts.

From the living room, Sophia covertly texted her brothers:

[Mommy's upset. Who did it?]

Liam responded instantly: [Probably Oliver.]

[Why?]

[Because Oliver coded that spam bot that insulted Mommy!]

[That's awful!]

Oliver finally chimed in: [...]

Sophia typed determinedly: [Don't worry, Ollie. I'll cheer Mommy up!]

Tucking her phone away, she launched Operation: Smile Revival—bringing Evelyn sketchbooks, performing silly dances, even offering her treasured candy stash.

But adult emotions were frustratingly complex. Though Evelyn smiled, the sadness lingered in her eyes.

By bedtime, Sophia had exhausted every trick in her six-year-old playbook. Defeated, she trudged to bed.

As Evelyn tucked her in, her phone buzzed. A single message from Oliver:

[I'm sorry.]

Her throat tightened. She knew exactly why he'd sent it—that bot attack had been his doing. The apology hung heavy between them, unspoken words thickening the air.
###Chapter 50

Evelyn couldn't fault Oliver for what happened.

He'd only been trying to help her separate Daniel from Serena faster.

None of them had expected Daniel's devotion to Serena would be this unshakable.

With a heavy sigh, Evelyn typed her reply: [I don't blame you. Stay safe.]

This was the first message Oliver had sent since she'd returned to Willowbrook.

The last time he'd reached out was during the Skywheel incident, and that had been an emergency.

Oliver had been against her decision to come back. He'd given her the silent treatment for weeks.

His desperate pleas still haunted her.

"Mom, please don't go. We'll find another way. We don't need him."

"I can't watch you go back to that man. I won't let you carry his child again."

"I'd rather die than see you suffer because of him. Stay away from him, please..."

"Don't make me spend my last days watching him destroy you. I can't bear it."

The memories made her chest tighten. She closed her eyes against the pain.

Her children had paid the price for her weakness.

Sophia had been frail since birth. Oliver's leukemia diagnosis at five had shattered them.

Liam's bone marrow wasn't compatible. Sophia's constant medications made hers unusable.

Nathan had searched everywhere with no success.

Returning to Daniel had been her only option.

Oliver's reply came quickly: [I will. Take care of Liam and Sophia. But most of all, take care of yourself. If it gets too hard, come home. My illness isn't worth your pain.]

Tears pricked her eyes at his maturity. She'd been back nearly a week.

She'd thought she was making progress driving Daniel and Serena apart. Today proved how wrong she'd been.

To Daniel, Serena would always be irreplaceable.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have fabricated evidence to protect her when the truth was undeniable.

Making him choose her over Serena seemed impossible.

Just like six years ago, when she couldn't make him love her.

Burrowing under the covers, Evelyn finally let the tears fall as she reread Oliver's message.

She'd failed as a mother. If she'd been stronger, Sophia might be healthy. Oliver wouldn't be sick.

With trembling fingers, she typed: [Promise me you'll take your meds.]

Eventually, the tears stopped. Her throat burned from crying.

Wiping her face, Evelyn slipped downstairs for water.

The kitchen was dark. She didn't bother with lights, navigating by the dim glow from the hallway.

The sharp scent of tobacco hit her first.

Then she saw the ember glowing in the darkness.

Before she could react, the lights flicked on.

Daniel lounged on the sofa, cigarette in hand.

His gaze locked onto her swollen, red-rimmed eyes.

"You've been crying." His voice cut through the silence like a blade.
###Chapter 51

Evelyn turned away without acknowledging him.
Daniel Blackwood was the last person she wanted to face right now.

She strode past the sofa, heading straight for the kitchen to pour herself a glass of water.

"Get me one too," Daniel's deep, detached voice carried from the living room.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, cursing him silently. Yet she still filled another glass and placed it on the coffee table with forced politeness.

She hadn’t forgotten her role—she was the maid, and he was the master of Silvercrest Manor.
A servant serving her employer was the most mundane thing in the world.

"Why were you crying?"

The moment she set the glass down, Daniel flicked ash from his cigarette into the tray with practiced elegance.
His piercing gaze locked onto her face, as if trying to peel back the layers of her thoughts.

Evelyn wiped her nose, straightening her posture. "No reason. I just felt like it."

She met his eyes briefly. "Mr. Blackwood, if that’s all, I’ll retire for the night."

She turned to leave.

But as she passed him, his arm shot out, yanking her onto his lap.
The sharp scent of whiskey clung to him, flooding her senses.

"Was it Serena? Did she upset you?" His voice was low, smooth, as he pinned her against the sofa.

The sudden closeness made her skin prickle. She struggled, but his grip was unyielding.
When she finally shoved him back, she was left breathless, sprawled across the cushions.

"You're drunk."

"I’m not." Daniel didn’t touch her again, just leaned back with a cold smirk.

"What’s there to be upset about? Even if Serena was wrong, you came to me with unrealistic expectations too."

"I lost more today," Evelyn scoffed, amused by his twisted logic.

She glared at him. "But you’ll still defend her, won’t you? She’s your fiancée. You’ll excuse every flaw, even help cover her tracks. Meanwhile, I’m just some nobody dragged into this mess—secretly photographed, branded a homewrecker. Don’t I have the right to be angry?"

Daniel’s brow furrowed slightly. He pulled her upright, then grabbed the water glass and drained it in one gulp.

"Serena... matters to me. She mattered to my wife, too."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She hadn’t expected him to bring her up.

"Is that so?" She forced a smile.

Was Serena that important?

Yes. Once, she’d been everything. Evelyn had trusted her like a sister, shared every secret.
Until Serena stole her husband. After that, she became a living reminder—never trust too easily.

"Yes."

Daniel’s gaze turned distant, his voice thick with alcohol. "Serena was my wife’s younger sister. The person she loved most. My wife... she was the kindest, brightest soul I’ve ever known."

His eyes drifted past Evelyn, lost in memory. "The first time I saw her, she was standing under the cherry blossoms at university. So beautiful, I couldn’t look away..."
###Chapter 52

Daniel's drunken confession about their first meeting made Evelyn's stomach churn. Every word dripping from his lips tasted like poison to her.

He never realized their true first encounter wasn't beneath cherry blossoms. It was on a rain-slicked road where he lay broken and bleeding.

Years ago, a speeding car had left Daniel crumpled on the asphalt. Abandoned by the roadside, it was Evelyn who found him. She'd stayed by his hospital bed for thirty endless days while he hovered between life and death.

She'd fallen for him then, but crushed those feelings instantly. A man like him would never look twice at someone like her. So when his eyes finally fluttered open, she vanished without a trace.

Fate played its cruel joke when they met again years later. This time, she threw caution to the wind and pursued him recklessly. Their wedding day should have been her happiest memory.

Instead, he'd coldly informed her, "I don't love you."

No promises of future affection. Just a transactional agreement to make her Mrs. Blackwood. How foolish she'd been to consider that romantic.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms as she glared at Daniel. She'd sacrificed everything for this man - her career, her dignity. All because he'd casually remarked, "We should start a family."

Three beautiful children later, his gratitude came in the form of betrayal with her own sister, Serena. Then came the staged accident on Harborview Bridge. The forged will accusing her of infidelity. The demand that he marry Serena to "honor her memory."

Even now, oceans away, those nightmares left her shaking. If not for Oliver's medical needs, she'd have ripped Daniel's chest open long ago to see if he even possessed a heart.

This heartless monster now dared wax poetic about their love story? While she stood there as a stranger - just another faceless maid in his employ.

Perhaps this charade soothed whatever remained of his conscience.

"I don't understand," Evelyn's voice dripped venom. "If Mrs. Blackwood meant so much, why shackle yourself to Serena? Because she's your dead wife's sister?"

Daniel shook his head. "The will requested I care for Serena. Marriage seemed the surest way to honor that."

Evelyn's laugh was sharp enough to draw blood. "So you became engaged out of obligation? How noble."

His brow furrowed. "After my wife's death, our engagement provided Serena protection."

"Bullshit." Evelyn stood abruptly. "No woman would will her husband to her sister. And if protection was your goal, why not name her your ward? Declare her your sister-in-law under your care? The world would accept that."

Daniel's dark eyes studied her silently.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "Stop lying to yourself, Mr. Blackwood. You wanted Serena. Don't drape your desires in your late wife's memory."
###Chapter 53

Evelyn Carter spent a restless night.

Vivid dreams of Daniel Blackwood haunted her. The way her heart raced when they first met. The joy she felt during their wedding photoshoot. The whirlwind of their actual ceremony...

In every dream, she kept demanding answers from Daniel.

Why? How could their love be erased so completely?

Morning light revealed tear-stained pillows. Some heartbreaks never fade, no matter how many years pass.

"Mommy." Sophia Carter stood by the bed clutching a tissue. She gently dabbed Evelyn's cheeks. "Did Daddy upset you again?"

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut and pulled Sophia close. The child's warmth reignited her strength.

For six years, her triplets had been her reason to keep going. Nothing would ever make her abandon them.

"Don't cry, Mommy."

Sophia patted Evelyn's back soothingly. "Oliver, Liam, and I will always be with you. Always."

The words pierced Evelyn's heart. She held Sophia until Ethan Reynolds knocked.

"Evelyn? You awake?"

Frowning, Evelyn released Sophia and opened the door.

"What?"

"If you're up... could you make Daniel some hangover soup?" Ethan shifted uncomfortably. "He's got an important meeting, but he overdid it last night. The staff aren't in yet."

"Fine."

She grabbed a robe and headed downstairs.

In the kitchen, she prepped ingredients for the soup while starting breakfast for Sophia.

Ethan lingered in the doorway, clearly wanting to say more.

"Out with it," Evelyn said without turning from the stove.

He hesitated before meeting her profile. "About yesterday at Serena's... I lied."

Evelyn's knife stilled briefly before resuming chopping. "Which part?"

"The bank transfer. It came from Serena's personal account." Ethan studied Evelyn's puffy eyes. After her dramatic exit yesterday, he owed her this truth.

"So why say it was company funds?"

The answer was obvious - Daniel's orders.

"Serena's his fiancée." Ethan exhaled heavily. "Future lady of Blackwood Estate. Some truths are better left unsaid. Besides, the scandal's buried now."

His gaze turned pleading. "As staff, we sometimes swallow pride for our employers. You understand?"

Evelyn turned off the burner with a sharp twist.

"So because I'm staff, I should just take Serena's abuse? Is that it?"
###Chapter 54

Six years ago when Evelyn Carter ruled this household, no one ever treated her with the respect she was owed.

Ethan Reynolds hesitated before answering. "True." He crossed his arms. "But that's merely your interpretation."

Evelyn rummaged through the kitchen cabinets until she found a spoon and tray. The porcelain felt cool against her fingertips as she scrubbed them clean.

"I've endured enough humiliation in this lifetime." Her voice carried the weight of years of suppressed anger. "I refuse to swallow another ounce of it."

With the tray in hand, she brushed past Ethan without another glance, her heels clicking sharply against the marble stairs.

Ethan remained rooted in place, watching her retreating figure. His dark eyes clouded with unreadable emotions.

Who would choose suffering if given an alternative? But back then, winning Serena Hart's favor had been a matter of survival. Once she became the lady of Blackwood Estate, it would've been too late.

Master Bedroom

Daniel Blackwood was propped against the headboard when Evelyn entered, his phone casting blue light across his haggard features. The aftermath of last night's drinking left him with a pounding headache that made even sitting up a challenge.

His memories of the previous evening were fragmented at best. When the door opened, he looked up to see Evelyn's frosty expression. The sight of her triggered something in his foggy mind.

She approached without warmth, thrusting the soup toward him. Daniel's gaze immediately caught on her swollen, red-rimmed eyes.

"Crying again?" The question slipped out before he could stop it.

Evelyn's lips twisted into a bitter smile. She met his stare head-on. "How original, Mr. Blackwood. You asked me the exact same thing last night in the parlor. Should I expect you to pin me against the wall again? Or perhaps you'd prefer to recount how you met your precious wife this time?"

Daniel's brow furrowed. The memories were still elusive. "I... told you about my wife?"

"Every sordid detail." Evelyn set the tray down with unnecessary force when he made no move to take it. "How you only got engaged to Ms. Hart because of her. How your saintly wife remembered her sister in her will even while dying pregnant." Her voice turned razor-sharp. "Though some might say you killed her to be with your mistress."

The words had festered inside her for years. She'd dreamed of throwing them in his face, of watching him squirm when confronted with his own lies.

His reaction crushed those expectations.

Daniel's expression remained impassive. "You overstep your bounds, servant. My family affairs are none of your concern."

He wouldn't justify himself to staff, yet her accusations clawed at him. For six years, he'd carried Evelyn Carter's memory like a sacred relic. He wouldn't tolerate anyone tarnishing it—least of all this insolent maid.

"Of course." Evelyn's laugh held no mirth. "Just a lowly servant with no right to defend herself. Even when photographed without consent and publicly shamed, I should endure it silently. After all, your beloved fiancée Serena Hart owns this house now."

She turned on her heel before he could respond, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the frame.

Daniel stared at the closed door, his headache worsening. The meeting reminder on his phone pulled him from his thoughts. He reached for the abandoned soup, taking a reluctant sip.

The flavor exploded across his tongue—familiar and impossible.

His entire body went rigid. The porcelain bowl slipped from suddenly numb fingers, shattering against the hardwood floor.
###Chapter 55

This couldn't be happening! The soup tasted exactly like Evelyn Carter's recipe!

Daniel Blackwood's high-profile career demanded constant socializing. During their marriage, he'd often stagger home drunk. Every time, without fail, Evelyn would prepare this exact hangover remedy.

She'd always added a distinctive blend of spices that made it unmistakable. Six years had passed since Daniel last tasted her cooking.

Yet here it was - identical in every way to Evelyn's signature soup.

Daniel threw off the covers and bolted downstairs without another thought.

In the kitchen below, Evelyn was preparing oatmeal for Emily. So focused was she that she didn't hear his rapid footsteps approaching.

She only noticed his presence when his shadow fell across her workspace.

Daniel spun her around, gripping her chin with bruising force. His piercing gaze bore into her. "Where did you learn to make that soup?"

Evelyn startled at his sudden aggression. Instinct made her struggle, but his grip only tightened.

"I taught myself," she answered evenly.

"Lies." His voice rasped from last night's excess. "The flavor profile is identical. What's your connection to Evelyn Carter? Did she send you?"

With each word, his conviction grew.

An internationally renowned jewelry designer returns to Willowbrook. Abandons her career. Takes a maid position at Silvercrest Manor without complaint.

She treats Emily like her own. Shares Evelyn's name. Decorates identically. Now this - the same exact soup recipe.

If not for her different eyes, he might suspect plastic surgery. But he knew better.

Evelyn had always looked at him with warmth. This woman's gaze held only polite detachment. No resemblance whatsoever.

Daniel studied every microexpression as Evelyn's pulse raced.

A simple bowl of soup had nearly exposed her!

She bit her lip, forcing calm into her voice. "Mr. Blackwood, I don't understand. I found the recipe online."

Deliberately slow speech masked her panic. "Perhaps Evelyn Carter posted it. I follow her social media."

Daniel's grip faltered.

True. Evelyn had loved sharing life's little joys. The realization made him release her with visible disgust.

His expression turned glacial. "I forgot - you specialize in imitation."

Of course. She'd copied Evelyn from the beginning to gain his notice. This was just another calculated move.

His voice dropped to a warning. "Stop trying to be her. No one replaces Evelyn Carter."

As he turned away, Evelyn caught something unexpected in his posture - a fleeting vulnerability.
###Chapter 56

Evelyn let out a hollow laugh, shaking her head as she pushed away the tangled thoughts.

How could Daniel possibly feel lonely? She was the one who'd been drowning in solitude all these years.

Turning back to the stove, she focused on preparing Emily's oatmeal.

The polished metal surface caught her reflection unexpectedly. Her delicate features looked almost ethereal in that moment - high cheekbones, full lips, flawless skin. Yet the beauty brought no joy, only emptiness.

For days, Evelyn made herself scarce around Daniel. First, because of their last encounter - she couldn't muster the energy to fake pleasantries anymore. Second, he'd started questioning her connection to Evelyn Carter. The less visible she was, the better.

The entire Silvercrest Manor staff noticed her avoidance.

"You're forgetting your station, Evelyn," one senior maid scolded. "The Blackwoods pay your wages. That attitude won't fly here."

"Never seen a servant act so bold in all my years," another chimed in. "You'll be out on the street before you know it."

"Don't think you're the only one who can care for little Miss Sophia," a third warned.

Evelyn didn't realize Daniel had orchestrated these comments. But no amount of pressure would change her stance.

Sophia sensed something amiss with her "Mommy." She asked Liam what was wrong.

"Probably still upset about that last incident," Liam explained matter-of-factly. "Realized splitting up that cheating scumbag and his mistress isn't so easy. She'll snap out of it - women's moods change like the weather."

But a week passed with no improvement.

Evelyn treated Daniel like invisible air. Beyond essential communication, she spoke not a word to him. Her obedience became almost robotic, unsettling in its perfection.

In his study, Daniel stared blankly at financial reports, Evelyn's impassive face haunting his thoughts. The numbers blurred together unread.

She performed her duties impeccably, cared for Sophia flawlessly. Yet the moment he entered a room, her expression turned to stone.

Even Sophia had asked, "Daddy, did you make Mommy mad?"

Him? Make her angry? More like the opposite! He was master of Silvercrest Manor - she was merely staff. Even if he had offended her, she had no right to behave this way!

No woman had ever dared ignore Daniel Blackwood. The audacity burned. Was this some new tactic? Had she truly given up, or was this another game?

The unfamiliar discomfort gnawed at him until he finally snatched up his phone. "Ethan, send Evelyn to bring me coffee."

A pause. "Sir... you've already had two cups tonight. A third might-"

"Then have her make tea!" Daniel ground out between clenched teeth. "Just keep her occupied!"

If she refused to speak to him, he'd force the interaction himself.
###Chapter 57

Evelyn knocked lightly before entering with a steaming cup of tea. Daniel was seated at his desk, his phone pressed to his ear.

His cold gaze flickered toward her as she stepped inside, but he didn’t pause his tirade. "How many years have you worked here? Do I need to remind you about basic professionalism? Your bad mood isn’t my concern. If this happens again, consider your resignation."

A faint smile curved Evelyn’s lips. Though his words were directed at his employee, she knew they were meant for her.

This was the third time he’d summoned her—first for coffee, then tea, and now this. He didn’t need this much caffeine. No, this was about her indifference toward him.

Daniel Blackwood was used to deference, to people bending to his will. Her sudden disregard must have pricked his pride.

She set the cup down and turned to leave.

"Stop." His commanding voice halted her just as her fingers brushed the doorknob.

She hesitated but didn’t turn around.

"I’m tired." He leaned back in his chair. "Massage my shoulders."

Evelyn didn’t move. "Mr. Blackwood, I’m Sophia’s caretaker, not yours. The contract clearly states I answer only to her. The coffee and tea tonight were courtesies. Don’t mistake kindness for obligation."

Daniel’s jaw tightened.

He had insisted on that clause, back when he suspected her of scheming. Now, she was throwing his own words back at him.

Taking advantage?

"Goodnight." She didn’t wait for a response, slipping out before he could react.

The study door clicked shut.

Daniel glared at the empty space she’d left behind, irritation simmering. He tried to focus on his emails, but her words echoed in his mind, sharp and mocking.

Frustrated, he abandoned his desk and stalked into the sprawling gardens of Silvercrest Manor.

The estate’s grounds were vast—manicured hedges, a glistening artificial lake, winding cobblestone paths. Once, Evelyn had filled these gardens with vibrant blooms.

Six years had erased every trace of them.

The night air soothed him slightly. Moonlight bathed the quiet landscape, turning it into something ethereal.

Then he heard it—a soft, melodic voice drifting through the stillness.

"You have to take care of yourself when I’m not there. Be good for me, okay? I’d be so sad if anything happened to you."

Daniel’s steps slowed. He followed the sound until he spotted Evelyn perched atop a small hill, phone pressed to her ear.

Even from a distance, the tenderness in her expression sent an unexpected jolt through him.

The night was so silent he could hear every whispered word.
###Chapter 58

"I've missed you terribly. It's been too long."

"You know I love you. Why would you even ask?"

"Alright, enough teasing. Next time we meet, I'll bake your favorite cookies, I promise."

"And no one else gets a taste. Only you."

Daniel's expression darkened. That playful lilt in her voice, the intimate words—who was she speaking to? Another man?

No wonder she'd been so distant with him, barely sparing him a glance.

She must have moved on to someone else. This woman who once seemed so fixated on him had clearly shifted her attention. He should be relieved.

So why did it bother him so much? Why did it feel like a slow-burning anger was tightening in his chest?

Finally, Evelyn ended the call with a quiet sigh.

Liam, that cheeky little troublemaker, had been staying with Grace, acting all independent—cooking for her, even cleaning up sometimes. Yet he still called, whining about how lonely he was, how much he missed her, demanding cookies like a spoiled child. It had taken ages to calm him down.

As she lowered her phone, she caught sight of a tall figure standing near the cobblestone path.

The night was dark, but she'd recognize that silhouette anywhere. She used to know every angle of him, every shift in his posture.

She considered turning away, pretending she hadn't seen him—but he was blocking the only path back to Sophia’s room.

Evelyn steeled herself and walked forward, determined to breeze past him without a word.

But the moment she was within reach, Daniel’s hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

In one swift motion, he pinned her against the stone pillar, his grip unyielding.

"Who was that?" His voice was dangerously low, his eyes like ice.

"Mr. Blackwood." She tilted her chin up, meeting his gaze defiantly. "Who I talk to is none of your business."

"None of my business?" His fingers tightened slightly. "Weren’t you so determined to get close to me before? Changed your mind that easily?"

For a second, she was too stunned to respond. Then she let out a sharp laugh, twisting against his hold.

The more she struggled, the firmer his grip became.

"Let go!" She bit her lip, pushing against him with all her strength—but it was useless. He was too strong.

"Daniel Blackwood!" she snapped, finally breaking.

Her wide, furious eyes glared up at him, cheeks flushed, lips parted in frustration.

Something about the way she looked at him—the defiance, the fire—made his breath catch.

Maybe it was the moonlight. Maybe it was the way her pulse fluttered beneath his fingers.

Before he could stop himself, he leaned down and kissed her.
###Chapter 59

Daniel's intoxicating cologne enveloped her.

Evelyn remembered how she used to yearn for his kiss during their marriage. Three long years, and he never once initiated.

She'd always been the one to make the first move—whether in daily life or behind closed doors.

She used to think he was simply reserved. Now, the truth was painfully clear.

He wasn’t passive. He was only passive with her.

Here she was, his maid for barely two weeks, and he had no hesitation pressing his lips to hers.

The realization sent ice through her veins.

Slap!

Her palm connected with his cheek before his mouth could fully claim hers. The sharp sound echoed through the moonlit garden.

Daniel’s head snapped to the side. When he turned back, his eyes were black with fury.

"You dare hit me?" His voice was dangerously low.

Evelyn flexed her stinging fingers, meeting his glare without flinching. "You crossed a line, Mr. Blackwood. Did you expect me to thank you?"

A mocking smile curled her lips. "Or are you sober now?"

Silence. The air between them turned glacial under his murderous stare. She didn’t back down.

"Isn’t this what you wanted?" He finally spoke, voice dripping with disdain. "Playing hard to get once is clever, Evelyn. Twice is just pathetic."

Her nails bit into her palms. "Your arrogance is astounding."

"Then enlighten me." He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, smirk razor-sharp. "You impersonated my wife. Volunteered to be my maid. Butter up my daughter daily. Sabotage my relationship with Serena—"

His finger jabbed toward her. "Don’t think I don’t see through your little game."

Evelyn shut her eyes. Drew a steadying breath.

"Sabotage?" She laughed coldly. "Serena’s the one picking fights. But of course, you’d blame me."

She didn’t deny the rest. Yes, she wanted his attention.

But this? Him twisting everything to paint her as some scheming seductress? It only proved one thing—Daniel Blackwood was utterly, blindly in love with Serena Hart.

His hand shot out, gripping her wrist. "Deny it."

She recoiled until her back hit the ivy-covered wall.

"If you care so much about your fiancée," Evelyn hissed, "why kiss me? Do you get off on betrayal?"

First he’d cheated on her with Serena. Now he was cheating with her. The irony was almost laughable.

Daniel’s grip tightened. "Say that again," he warned, voice deadly.

She tilted her chin up. "Daddy? Auntie?"

A sleepy voice shattered the tension.

Little Emily stood in the doorway, rubbing her eyes. Her strawberry-blonde curls were tousled from sleep.

"Why are you still awake?" she mumbled, padding over to clutch Evelyn’s skirt. "I had a bad dream. Will you tuck me in?"

The child’s presence was a lifeline.

Evelyn turned to Daniel, voice steel. "Move."
###Chapter 60

"I'm taking Emily back to her room."

Evelyn bent down and scooped the sleeping child into her arms. She brushed past Daniel without a glance, marching determinedly toward Silvercrest Manor's grand entrance.

The heavy oak door slammed shut behind her.

Daniel remained rooted in place, his stormy gaze fixed on the closed door. After a long moment, he pulled out his phone with sharp movements. "Ethan. Bring the car around."

"Mr. Blackwood?" Ethan's voice crackled with sleep through the receiver. "It's nearly midnight. Where—"

"The office." Daniel's clipped tone brooked no argument.

"But you just transported all your files here this afternoon—"

"Change of plans. Got a problem with that?"

Evelyn's face flashed in his mind—those piercing eyes, the way her lips had parted in shock when he'd nearly kissed her. The memory sent an unfamiliar heat through his veins.

The sleek black sedan glided through Willowbrook's neon-lit streets. Daniel stared blankly at the passing cityscape, fingers drumming against the leather seat.

Five years. Five years he'd loved Evelyn Carter with every fiber of his being. So why did the sound of her laughing on the phone with someone else make him want to punch through a wall?

The car pulled up to Blackwood Tower's illuminated facade. Before Daniel could exit, two familiar figures came barreling through the revolving doors.

"Mr. Blackwood! Let me get those for you." Tyler Walsh reached for the stack of files in Ethan's arms.

Dominic Shaw adjusted his earpiece. "Working late again, sir?"

Daniel's gaze sharpened. "That boy from the amusement park—you're still in contact?"

Tyler blinked. "You mean our—"

"Boss," Dominic cut in sharply, hefting the documents. "Yes, we just video-called him."

"Good." Daniel straightened his cuffs. "Bring him to me. I want to talk."
###Chapter 61

Daniel and Tyler exchanged uneasy glances before turning to Dominic with awkward smiles. "Mr. Blackwood, it's nearly eight in the evening. Our boss is just a child—he should be asleep by now."

"Perhaps we could—"

Daniel's icy stare cut Tyler off mid-sentence. "Didn't you say he was chatting with you both online?"

The two bodyguards sighed before reluctantly dialing Liam's number to relay Daniel's request.

"Fine." Liam's voice dripped with cold amusement as he perched on Grace's balcony.

Sophia had just called, furious about how the bastard had fought with their mother. And now he wanted to meet? Perfect.

Time for some payback.

Liam dashed to the kitchen, grabbing a Sprite bottle and a pineapple from the fridge. He juiced the fruit, mixed it with soda, and added his special ingredients. The fizzy concoction went into a thermos before he headed downstairs.

The black Maserati arrived within minutes.

Daniel's sharp features appeared in the open car door, his expression unreadable. "Get in."

Liam climbed in, flashing an innocent smile. "Uncle Daniel, isn't it late for visits?"

"Do I need permission?" Daniel's gaze remained fixed ahead.

"Of course not."

Liam pretended to sip from his thermos, then offered it with exaggerated enthusiasm. "Want some? My special recipe!"

Ethan's grip tightened on the wheel. The hygiene-obsessed Mr. Blackwood sharing a cup with a random kid? Impossible.

Then Daniel drained the entire drink in one gulp.

Ethan's jaw dropped. Liam's eyes widened. That much would land anyone in the ER tonight!

Did this man have a death wish?

"Not bad." Daniel handed back the empty cup. "Got more?"

Liam blinked. "Uh... no?"

"Pity." Daniel turned to the window.

"Uncle Daniel..." Liam studied his profile. "You seem upset."

"You could say that."

Daniel's mind churned—memories of Evelyn's radiant smile on their wedding day clashing with the cold fury in her eyes when she'd slapped him earlier.

Everything had spiraled since Sophia returned. He'd never confided in strangers before, yet here he was, spilling his troubles to a six-year-old.

Liam frowned. According to Sophia, Daniel had hurt their mother. So why did he look so... tormented?

"Want to hear a story?" Daniel's voice softened unexpectedly.

For reasons he couldn't explain, he trusted Liam implicitly. Maybe because the boy had saved Sophia?

The urge to connect with this child was undeniable.
###Chapter 62

Daniel Blackwood felt like he was losing his mind.

"Want to hear a story?" Liam Carter blinked innocently, putting on his best behaved expression. "Tell me!"

Daniel gave a bitter smile. He signaled Ethan Reynolds to pull over at Harborview Bridge - deserted at this hour, with barely any passing vehicles.

Stepping out, Daniel leaned against the railing, staring at the dark waters below. "This is where my wife disappeared. She left me... then had her accident."

"When I got here, all I found were shattered railings and chaos. No trace of her." His voice cracked. "People said she died. I never believed them. Not without seeing her body."

His knuckles whitened against the railing. "Two weeks ago, I got proof. She's alive. More than that - she bore our daughter. The girl you saved at the amusement park."

Liam pressed his lips together, eyeing the now-repaired barrier. "She... fell from here?"

Daniel nodded grimly. "Hard to tell now, isn't it? Six years changes everything. Makes people forget."

A heavy silence settled between them.

Six years. Long enough for the world to forget Evelyn Carter. Even her own parents had started pushing him toward Serena Hart lately.

Yet Evelyn remained etched in his heart. Suddenly, her face flashed before his eyes - that same stubborn tilt of her chin.

The memory made him inexplicably angry. Was he finally forgetting her too? After six years of refusing every woman except... that other Evelyn. The one he kept breaking his own rules for.

Liam's small hands gripped the railing where his mother once stood. After a moment, he turned with startling intensity. "Did you ever love her?"

The question hung between them.

If Daniel loved his mother, why was Serena still in the picture? If he didn't, why give her three children?

Liam knew the truth - after being pulled from the sea, his mother delayed critical surgeries because of her pregnancy. She endured unbearable pain until he, Sophia and Oliver were born safely.

Sometimes Liam wondered if they'd been her burden. Without them, she might never have returned to this wretched city. Never crossed paths with this man again.

"How could I—"

Daniel's reply was cut short by a searing pain in his gut. He doubled over, sweat beading on his forehead.

"Sir!" Ethan sprang from the car, supporting Daniel's swaying frame. "What's wrong?"

"Home," Daniel gritted out between clenched teeth.

Liam's blood ran cold. If Daniel went home now, his mother would discover his prank. She'd be furious.

"We should go to the hospital!" Liam blurted, grabbing Ethan's sleeve. "Look how much pain he's in!"

Ethan hesitated, then nodded, helping Daniel into the backseat. As the car veered toward Grandview Medical Center, Liam exhaled in shaky relief. Crisis averted.

Then Ethan made a call.

"Evelyn? Are you awake? Sir's in bad shape - we're en route to Grandview from Harborview Bridge. Have the driver bring you there immediately. His stomach condition may be flaring up again."

Liam's stomach dropped. His mother would be waiting at the hospital. Now what? Jump out of a moving car?
###Chapter 63

"Daddy seemed fine during dinner."

Sophia clutched Evelyn's hand tightly as they waited in the grand lobby of Grandview Medical Center. Her small face was pinched with worry. "Why did he get sick so suddenly?"

"Maybe he ate or drank something afterward," Evelyn replied coolly.

Her gaze drifted toward the hospital entrance, brows knitting together. Daniel had always had an iron stomach. Even with all the business dinners and late-night drinks, she'd never known him to have digestive issues before.

And now, in just six years, it had become a chronic condition?

What had Serena been doing all this time? How had she let his health deteriorate like this?

Before she could dwell further, a sleek black Maserati pulled up at the entrance.

"It's Daddy!" Sophia immediately released Evelyn's hand and sprinted forward, her little legs carrying her as fast as they could.

Watching her daughter's frantic concern, an odd tightness gripped Evelyn's chest.

She strode forward as well.

Ethan jumped out from the driver's seat and yanked open the back door. "Evelyn, help me!"

Without hesitation, she moved to assist, supporting Daniel on one side while Ethan took the other.

Daniel's face was ashen, his features twisted in pain.

Despite the agony, he managed to turn his head slightly toward the car. "Liam... look after Sophia."

Liam.

The name made Evelyn freeze.

Her eyes snapped toward the backseat.

A small boy in a yellow shirt and denim overalls shrank back slightly, then peeked up at her. "H-Hi..."

Evelyn's breath caught.

What was Liam doing out this late? Why wasn't he in bed?

Her gaze sharpened as she turned to Sophia. "Stay in the car with him. Get to know him properly." She emphasized the last word.

Sophia blinked at Liam, startled. "Um... hi. Nice to meet you."

Liam didn't respond.

Seeing Daniel sway dangerously, Evelyn didn't waste another second. She snatched the keys from Ethan and tossed them to Liam. "Stay here. Don't move. Understood?"

Her tone wasn't that of a stranger speaking to a child—it was the stern command of a mother scolding her own.

Ethan frowned, puzzled, but said nothing as they hurried Daniel inside.

Outside the emergency room...

Ethan slumped onto a bench, accepting the tissue Evelyn handed him and wiping the sweat from his brow. "Don't worry. This happens sometimes."

"How long has he been like this?"

Ethan sighed. "About five or six years. After what happened with his wife, he drank nonstop. Ruined his stomach."

Back then, Daniel had locked himself away, drowning in alcohol day after day. No matter how Serena begged or yelled, he wouldn't stop.

Once, he drank until his stomach hemorrhaged. The doctors said only his previously robust health had saved him.

Every time Ethan remembered, his chest ached.

He'd never met Daniel's first wife. What kind of woman could drive a man like Daniel to self-destruction?

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the emergency room doors, her expression unreadable.

So after her "death," Daniel had turned into a drunkard?

Was it grief?

Or celebration that he and Serena were finally free of her?

Her eyes turned to ice.

Either way, she had only one thought:

He deserved it.
###Chapter 64

The emergency room doors swung open abruptly.

A stern-faced doctor emerged. "I need a complete list of everything Mr. Blackwood consumed today. Every single item."

Ethan's expression darkened. "What are you implying?"

"He's been dosed with a strong laxative."

Evelyn froze. She didn't need to ask—she already knew exactly who was responsible.

Before she'd returned, her mischievous son had deliberately sought out the doctors, complaining about severe constipation.

She exhaled sharply. This was ridiculous.

"And," the doctor added icily, glaring at Ethan, "you're aware of his fragile digestive system. Who allowed him to have iced drinks at night?"

Ethan stiffened. It was Liam who had handed Daniel that drink—but it had been laced with a laxative...

He inhaled deeply. "Evelyn, stay with Daniel. I need to question the staff who prepared dinner tonight."

But as he spoke, another realization struck him. Everyone had eaten the same meal. Why were Evelyn and Sophia unaffected? Even he felt fine. Only Daniel had suffered.

If dinner wasn’t the culprit, then it had to be what Daniel drank. Earlier, in the study, Evelyn had served him coffee and tea. Later, Liam had given him that iced drink.

Which meant...

Ethan’s gaze sharpened on Evelyn. "Was it the boy? Did he drug Daniel?"

How could a child that young harbor such malice? He had no reason to harm Daniel—if anything, he’d saved Sophia before.

Unless... it wasn’t Liam.

Unless it was her.

"It was me." Evelyn sighed, resigned. She wouldn’t let her son take the blame. "I was still angry about what happened before, so I slipped it into his drink."

Ethan’s face twisted with fury. "How could you? Daniel has done nothing but show you kindness! He tolerates your indifference, asks about your well-being—and this is how you repay him?" His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "I’m disgusted by you."

He shoved past her and stormed out.

Evelyn rubbed her temples, exhaling in frustration. She needed to deal with her son, still waiting in the car.

But before she could move, the ward door creaked open again.

Ethan stood there, his expression glacial. "He wants to see you."

She hesitated, then stepped inside.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled the room.

Daniel lay against the pillows, his face still unnaturally pale. "So. You’re the one who poisoned me?"

Evelyn swallowed. "Yes."

She braced herself. He’d fire her. Demand retribution.

But instead, Daniel turned to Ethan, his voice eerily calm. "Call the doctor."

"Why?"

Those dark, fathomless eyes locked onto Evelyn. "Tell him to bring laxatives. Enough for Ms. Carter to take right now."

A pause. Then, a chilling smile.

"Actually, no need. You must have leftovers, don’t you? Swallow them. Here. In front of me."
###Chapter 65

Evelyn's pockets were empty of any laxatives.
She lowered her gaze. "I didn't bring them with me."

"Ethan." Daniel's voice cut through the air like winter frost. "Go back to Silvercrest Manor and fetch the remaining laxatives."

Then his expression shifted, a dangerous glint in those piercing dark eyes as they locked onto Evelyn. "Where did you hide them?"

Evelyn bit her lower lip. She couldn't comprehend why this man was suddenly so insistent—so disturbingly eager—to force her to take the same laxatives he'd ingested.

Her brows knitted together. "Mr. Blackwood, it's too much trouble for Ethan to go all the way back. We're at Grandview Medical Center. Why not just ask a doctor to—"

"Yes!" Ethan clearly had no desire to make the trip either, cutting her off mid-sentence. "Sir, let me call a nurse instead—"

"I said I want her to take her share." Daniel's glacial stare silenced Ethan instantly. His tone could have frozen hell itself. "Is that unclear?"

Ethan stiffened. His face darkened like storm clouds rolling in.

He turned his bleak gaze to Evelyn. "Where. Are. They?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply through her nose. She had no laxatives—this entire situation was absurd. But she had to improvise.

"Bottom drawer of my nightstand."

They were just multivitamins she'd bought recently for Sophia. But under these circumstances, they'd have to do.

"Ethan." Daniel's flat command needed no elaboration.

"Leaving now." Ethan practically bolted from the private ward.

The door clicked shut, sealing Evelyn alone with Daniel in the suffocating silence. Her throat constricted uncomfortably.

"I'll... get some water." She edged toward the exit.

"Use mine."

Daniel nodded at the steaming cup on his bedside table.

Evelyn's tongue darted over parched lips. "I'd prefer a fresh bottle—"

"Problem with sharing?" One dark brow arched.

How could she say yes? She forced a smile. "Just concerned about hygiene."

"Not an issue." His unblinking stare pinned her in place. "Drink."

Evelyn's fingers twitched. After three heartbeats of hesitation, she grabbed the cup and took a cautious sip.

Warmth spread through her, easing the tension in her shoulders.

"There are laxatives in that water." Daniel's murmur curled around her like smoke.

Evelyn recoiled, nearly dropping the cup. Her wide eyes flew to his face.

Since when? He'd just woken up!

Daniel's lips curved at her horrified expression. He adjusted his position on the bed. "Joke."

Evelyn gaped.

Since when did the human glacier develop a sense of humor? The Daniel Blackwood she knew could freeze hell with a glance.
###Chapter 66

"You begged to share my bed, claimed you wanted to be mine, yet you recoil from my touch." Daniel's icy stare pinned Evelyn in place. "You drugged me, refused to drink what I offered. What game are you playing, Evelyn?"

His gaze burned through her. She ducked her head, fingers twisting in the hospital sheets.

"Clever plan, poisoning me. But laxatives?" A dark chuckle rumbled from his chest. "Amateur mistake."

Evelyn's throat tightened. She gnawed her lip until copper flooded her tongue.

"Your target wasn't me." Daniel's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "So tell me, what do you really want?"

Was it about impersonating Evelyn Carter? Or just attachment to little Emily? Neither explanation held water. There had to be more.

Evelyn stayed mute. This man dissected lies like a surgeon. One slip and he'd unravel everything - her identity, her motives, Liam's existence.

The heart monitor beeped in the sterile silence. Daniel waited. Evelyn counted each breath.

The door burst open. Ethan stormed in, waving a candy-colored bottle. "Sir! Found these on her nightstand!"

"Children's vitamins?" Ethan glared at Evelyn. "You filled them with laxatives? What if Emily mistook—"

Daniel popped two tablets into his mouth. Chewed. Swallowed.

Ethan's jaw hit the floor. "Sir! You just got your stomach pumped!"

"Orange flavor." Daniel took two more.

Ethan gaped. "Since when do laxatives come fruit-flavored?" Then realization dawned. His head snapped toward Evelyn. "These aren't drugs. Where'd you hide the real thing?"

Daniel recapped the bottle. "Put these away. For Emily."

"But—"

"If she confessed to drugging me," Daniel's gaze never left Evelyn, "why hide evidence?"

Ethan's protest died.

"Evelyn." Daniel's voice cracked like a whip despite his pallor. "You're protecting someone."

Her head jerked up. "I used my only pill on you. There are no others."

She couldn't risk him discovering Liam. One slip about the boy, and her entire facade would crumble.

"Pathetic lie." Daniel's lips curled. "Who is that child to you?"
###Chapter 67

Evelyn gasped. "None!" She denied it instantly, afraid that Daniel would discover her connection with Liam.

Daniel said nothing, merely studying her with that piercing gaze that made her pulse race. The silence stretched between them, thick with tension.

Finally, she lifted her chin. "I'm not related to him—honest. I just..." She exhaled sharply, her eyes flicking to Ethan standing beside Daniel.

"It's because of Mr. Reynolds. He said he wanted to find out who drugged you. He claimed if it wasn't me, it'd be the other boy outside."

At the mention of Liam, Evelyn forced indifference into her voice. "I think the boy was just playing a prank. He wouldn’t handle your anger well. He’s just a kid."

"So you confessed to protect him?"

"Mhm."

"Ah." Daniel's lips curved, amused. "Who knew Ms. Carter had such compassion for a stranger’s child?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Yes, my fatal flaw. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have worked so hard to become your maid at Silvercrest Manor and nearly gotten assaulted by you, right?" She deliberately emphasized the word assaulted.

Ethan’s eyes widened comically. He gaped at Evelyn, then at Daniel, as if the world had tilted sideways.

Daniel—chaste, untouchable Daniel—had assaulted Evelyn? The man who barely touched his own fiancée, Serena?

And from Daniel’s lack of denial, it seemed true. Ethan’s mind reeled. Had he misjudged Evelyn? If she wasn’t the threat, why was Daniel the one crossing lines?

His shock must have been obvious because Daniel’s jaw tightened. "Leave."

"Right away!" Ethan spun on his heel.

Before shutting the door, he shot Evelyn a look. "Good luck."

Evelyn and Daniel exchanged glances. What was that about?

Once alone, the air between them grew charged. Evelyn cleared her throat. "Mr. Blackwood, if there’s nothing else, I should go—"

"I know you have an agenda." Daniel’s voice was low, unreadable. "I won’t force you to confess."

His gaze darkened. "Many have tried to use me. You’re the first to succeed. Whatever your plan, remember this—Sophia and Evelyn Carter are my only lines. As long as you don’t endanger Sophia or slander Evelyn, you can stay."

He could replace her. But Sophia adored her. After the Skywheel incident, he was certain Evelyn would never hurt his daughter.

Strangely, she cared more for Sophia than he did.

That’s why he let her stay.

Evelyn smirked. "Just those two? What about your fiancée, Ms. Hart?"

Daniel stiffened. Then he chuckled. "You really dislike her."

"Obviously. The feeling’s mutual."
###Chapter 68

Daniel's lips curved into a smirk. "Quite accurate."

His piercing gaze then shifted to Evelyn. "Strangely enough, I couldn't care less what you do to Serena. I'm rather curious to see who comes out on top."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. So that's why he hadn't mentioned Serena earlier - he'd been waiting for her to bring it up.

He wanted to witness a showdown between her and Serena? She highly doubted that.

More likely, Daniel was trying to create some healthy competition for Serena, perhaps feeling he'd spoiled her too much?

After all, this was the same man who'd once been willing to sacrifice Evelyn - pregnant with triplets - for Serena's sake. What wouldn't he do now?

The bitter irony wasn't lost on her. Back then, Daniel's obsession with pleasing Serena had destroyed her. Now, history repeated itself.

A wry smile played on Evelyn's lips despite the ache in her chest. "Obviously, I'm no match for Ms. Hart."

Some things never changed. Six years ago or now, Serena would always have the upper hand.

"Don't be so sure." Daniel massaged his throbbing temples, eyes closed. "It's late. Take Sophia home to rest."

Evelyn nodded curtly and turned on her heel. Not a second longer would she spend in this man's presence.

Her hand was on the doorknob when his voice stopped her. "Have the boy stay at Silvercrest Manor tonight. Servants can return him tomorrow."

She stiffened. "Mr. Blackwood, after what he did... aren't you angry?"

"Should be," Daniel admitted flatly. "But strangely, I'm not. The kid... grows on you."

Evelyn's pulse stuttered. "Understood."

She exited without looking back.

The door clicked shut.

Daniel exhaled sharply, reaching for the water glass. Only after swallowing did he realize - Evelyn's lips had touched the same rim.

He set it down abruptly. An indirect... His thoughts trailed off as memories surfaced - that near-kiss at the manor, the inexplicable pull he'd felt toward her.

Since Evelyn Carter left, no woman had caught his attention. Yet that night, this other Evelyn had captivated him completely.

The desire to close the distance between them, to claim her lips... it unsettled him.

Daniel's bitter laugh echoed in the empty room. What was happening to him? He'd sworn eternal devotion to Evelyn Carter.

Not only was she alive, she'd even returned his daughter to him. So why was he fantasizing about a woman he'd known barely a month?

Summoning Ethan moments later, Daniel didn't wait for pleasantries. "Bring tomorrow's files from the office."

Ethan blinked. "Sir, you can't possibly mean to work through the night? Your condition-"

One icy glare silenced him. "Leaving now!"

Ethan practically sprinted from the room, already typing furiously on his phone:

[What did you DO to Daniel? He's so pissed he's pulling an all-nighter!]
###Chapter 69

Evelyn Carter brought Liam and Sophia back to Silvercrest Manor, shooting Grace a quick text to let her know Liam was with them.

"Wow, the jerk's place is actually decent." Liam's eyes darted around the manor's elegant interior as they entered. "We were crammed in that tiny apartment overseas while he got to live like this alone?"

Evelyn frowned. "Liam, mind your words!" Thankfully, the staff had already left for the day. If anyone had heard him...

"I checked. It's just us in the house right now."

Grinning mischievously, Liam hooked his pinky finger around Evelyn's. "Don't worry, Mommy. I'll behave."

Sophia rolled her eyes dramatically, plopping onto the sofa with crossed arms. "If you really meant that, Daniel wouldn't be in the hospital with Mommy taking the blame."

Her voice grew sharper. "I know you and Oliver hate him, but this isn't the time for revenge! We still need his help for Oliver's treatment."

Liam's lips pursed at Sophia calling Daniel "Daddy." "Since when did you two get so close?"

"It's not about being close!" Sophia's cheeks flushed. "We genuinely need his help right now!"

Seeing her sister's reaction, Liam sighed. "Fine. I messed up. Won't happen again."

He'd only meant to prank Daniel—who knew the guy had such a weak stomach?

"Enough." Evelyn took a deep breath, preparing the guest room. "You're staying here tonight. Tomorrow, I'll have someone take you back."

"Mhm." Liam climbed obediently onto the bed. "Night, Mommy!"

His dark eyes sparkled with innocence, but Evelyn wasn't fooled. "Stay put. No wandering around, understand?"

"Yes!"

He pouted under the covers. "Mommy, I'm your son. Stop treating me like some criminal."

Evelyn gave him a pointed look. "That's because your 'ideas' always end in disaster."

Among her three children, Liam was the cleverest—and the most unpredictable.

"Relax!" He snuggled into the pillows. "I'll sleep like an angel. It's almost ten—gotta keep my perfect sleep schedule!"

Only when his eyes closed did Evelyn exhale, switching off the lights.

The moment the door clicked shut, Liam's eyes flew open. He ducked under the blanket and dialed Oliver.

Across the ocean, afternoon sunlight streamed through a hospital window. Oliver answered, amused. "Shouldn't you be asleep?"

"Ollie," Liam whispered, "Guess where I am right now!"

A pause. Then, dryly: "Let me guess. The scumbag's house?"

Liam deflated. "How'd you know?"
###Chapter 70

Daniel Blackwood gave nothing away—that was precisely why he wanted Oliver Carter to guess his location.

"First, you just got back recently. There aren't many places you could be." Oliver's voice still carried the lightness of youth, but his reasoning was sharp. "Second, you're making me guess, so it must be somewhere I'd never expect. And third, you sound way too excited about this—meaning you just had to tell me."

A pause. Then, with chilling accuracy: "You're at that bastard Daniel Blackwood's house, aren't you?"

Liam groaned. "You ruin everything."

"Then stop playing stupid games." Oliver's chuckle was soft. "Why are you there?"

Liam bit his lip and recounted the night's events.

"That was reckless." Oliver's tone turned serious. "Thank God Mom handled it. If she hadn't, that snake might've connected you to her. Daniel's paranoid—he would've tracked your every move after that."

"I know, okay?" Liam huffed. He'd already agonized over this on the way to Grandview Medical Center that night. But what was done was done—Daniel had swallowed those laxatives. It wasn't like Liam could've pumped his stomach.

Oliver sighed, recognizing his brother's stubbornness. They exchanged a few more words before shifting topics.

"So what's your plan now?"

A wicked grin spread across Liam's face. "I'm sending you Daniel's IP. Hack into his study's surveillance system."

Oliver frowned. "You're going in there?"

"Not just going in." Liam's eyes gleamed. "I'm copying every important file I can find."

He leaned forward. "I don't know business like you do. But if I send you the documents, you'll know which ones matter."

"You're planning to—"

"Insurance." Liam's voice dropped. "Mom and Emily are too soft. We've been back for months, and what have they accomplished? Mom says she hates him, but we both know she still cares."

A heavy sigh. "So it's on us, Oliver. If they fail, we'll use his own company against him."

Oliver didn't love the idea—but Daniel Blackwood's business files? That was tempting. After a long pause, he relented. "I'll try."

The call ended. Moments later, encrypted data flashed across Oliver's screen. Within an hour, he'd breached Silvercrest Manor's firewall—no small feat, given Daniel's own hacking skills. The surveillance feeds froze.

[Go now.]

[Got it.]

Liam, who'd been napping while waiting, bolted upright. He darted to the study, fired up Daniel's computer, and inserted a flash drive. Files began copying—slowly.

Bored, he clicked a folder labeled [Eternal Regret]. Expecting company secrets, he instead froze.

The woman in the photos... was his mother. Dozens of them. His hands shook over the mouse.

Did that bastard actually... care about her?
###Chapter 71

Daniel Blackwood's study door finally creaked open after nearly an hour. Oliver Carter slipped out silently, his small frame barely making a sound against the thick carpet.

He tiptoed back to the guest bedroom, sliding under the covers with practiced stealth. His fingers flew across his phone screen: [Oliver, reactivate surveillance now.]

A quick reply came: [Done. What took so long?]

Even with massive files, it shouldn't have required that much time. Liam Carter hesitated, his thumb hovering over the screen before typing: [Found something unexpected. Copied files about Mom. Sending everything tomorrow.]

[Understood.] Oliver's response was characteristically blunt, oblivious to his brother's turmoil. [System's live again. Get some sleep.]

Liam shoved the phone under his pillow, wrapping his arms around himself. The darkness of the room pressed in as he stared at the ceiling.

His entire life, he'd believed Daniel to be the villain of Mom's story - a cheating liar who'd discarded her without remorse. But the digital trails he'd uncovered tonight painted a disturbingly different picture.

A heavy sigh escaped him. Nothing made sense anymore.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Evelyn Carter arranged Liam's return. Grace Thornton stood barefoot at the doorway, her wild bedhead bouncing as she spotted the arriving car.

"You little demon!" She lunged, grabbing Liam's ear with maternal fury. "Sneaking out at night? Thank heavens you went to Evelyn! If you'd gotten kidnapped, how would I face your mother?"

Her teeth worried her bottom lip. "Swear on your life, Liam Carter. Never again."

Liam studied Grace's sleep-rumpled appearance and the genuine fear in her eyes. "I swear," he relented, letting her keep her grip. "Won't happen again."

"Better not." Grace yanked his sleeve. "Now march your butt inside. We're getting two more hours of sleep."

Daniel barely glanced up when Ethan Reynolds entered the Blackwood Enterprises office. "The boy's home safe, sir."

A noncommittal grunt was his only response.

Ethan shifted uncomfortably. "Forgive me, but after what he did to you - the hospital stay - why show him such kindness?"

"Perhaps I see something worth nurturing." Daniel's gaze flicked to the folders in Ethan's hands. "What else?"

"The Skywheel investigation report." Ethan placed a thick file on the desk. "Confirmed sabotage. The hired lackeys aren't talking yet, but we'll crack them."

Daniel flipped through pages with clinical detachment. "And?"

Ethan produced a second dossier. "Found the paparazzo who photographed you and Evelyn. Same puppet master pulling both strings." His finger tapped the twin files meaningfully. "Our analysis suggests one orchestrator."

Daniel's brow furrowed as he aligned the documents, his fingers tracing invisible connections between them.
###Chapter 72

Daniel Blackwood finally waved his hand dismissively. "You may leave now."

Ethan Reynolds gave a curt nod before turning on his heel. The door clicked shut behind him with finality.

Daniel's piercing gaze remained fixed on the two investigation files spread across his desk. His fingers drummed an impatient rhythm against the polished mahogany surface.

A bitter laugh escaped his lips moments later.

When placed side by side, both documents pointed to one undeniable name: Serena Hart. The evidence was irrefutable.

She wanted Emily dead. She sought to eliminate the very people who had shown her nothing but kindness.

Daniel squeezed his eyes shut.

Serena. Evelyn Carter's beloved sister. Even in her final moments, Evelyn had made Daniel promise to look after her younger sibling.

And now he had to choose between that promise and protecting his own daughter with Evelyn.

"You've left me with an impossible choice, Evelyn," he murmured to the empty study.

Blackwood Estate.

Serena Hart had been waiting in the grand foyer for thirty excruciating minutes, clutching an ornate velvet box to her chest.

"Has Eleanor Blackwood risen yet?" she demanded, eyeing the leisurely staff with growing irritation.

The maid barely glanced up from her polishing. "Madam takes her time in the mornings. If you find the wait unbearable, Ms. Hart, you're welcome to return another day."

Serena's nails dug into the box's velvet covering. She forced a saccharine smile. "I'll wait as long as necessary."

She would see the old woman today, no matter what.

Another half hour crawled by before Eleanor Blackwood made her grand descent, leaning heavily on her cane while two maids hovered at her elbows.

Spotting Serena, Eleanor's lips curled into a knowing smirk as she settled into her throne-like armchair. "To what do I owe this... early visit, Ms. Hart?"

"Granny Eleanor!" Serena sprang up eagerly, nearly tripping in her haste. She thrust the velvet box forward like a peace offering. "This is from Vincent Delacroix's private collection - each piece is one-of-a-kind. I had to pull countless strings to acquire this before its official release."

Eleanor's brow arched as she lifted the lid. The diamond necklace inside made her breath catch - just for a second - before her expression smoothed into practiced indifference.

"A thoughtful gift," she conceded, snapping the box shut.

Serena wrung her hands. "I'd planned to present this at your birthday gala, but..." She let the sentence hang.

Eleanor's grip tightened on her cane. "But?"

"But Daniel intends to publicly dissolve our engagement that very night." Serena's voice cracked perfectly on cue. A single tear traced her cheek. "Five years as his fiancée, and he'd humiliate me before all of Willowbrook's elite. How am I to show my face afterward? What respectable family would have me now?"

Her shoulders shook with carefully calculated sobs as she awaited the old matriarch's reaction.
###Chapter 73

"Ridiculous!"

Serena's tears only fueled Eleanor Blackwood's anger. The elderly woman smashed her teacup onto the table with enough force to make the china rattle.

"When Daniel insisted on marrying you to fulfill Evelyn's dying wish, this family objected. Yet he wouldn't listen!"

Five years of grudging acceptance flashed across Eleanor's face before her expression darkened again. "And now he wants to break the engagement? Does my grandson think this is some childish game?"

Her gaze lingered on the jewelry box before softening as she turned to Serena. "Don't fret, child. You've always been dutiful to me. That maid must have bewitched Daniel into saying those foolish things. I won't let him cancel the wedding."

Serena bit her quivering lip, eyes glistening with manufactured grief. "You're too kind, Grandmother Eleanor..."

Dabbing at nonexistent tears, she brightened suddenly. "Since you're so generous, I must return the favor. These are just small tokens—I remember Vincent Delacroix has another collection coming soon. I'll acquire it for your birthday, shall I?"

Eleanor's face transformed instantly, wrinkles smoothing into a pleased smile. "Naturally, naturally! Leave this matter to me."

"Thank you!" Serena executed a perfect bow before straightening. "I won't take more of your time. Please enjoy the gifts."

The butler escorted her out. When he returned, curiosity got the better of him. "You never approved of Ms. Hart."

"True." Eleanor's eyes closed, conjuring an image of Evelyn Carter.

She'd despised Evelyn too when Daniel first brought her home, constantly urging him to divorce the girl. Yet against all expectations, Daniel only loved Evelyn more fiercely—so much that her disappearance nearly destroyed him with grief.

However much Eleanor disliked Serena, she had to admit Evelyn had been infinitely superior. At least...

Her eyes snapped open, landing on the jewelry box. At least Evelyn never schemed like this.

But a maid? Unthinkable. However distasteful, Serena remained the lesser evil.

At five o'clock, Evelyn Carter emerged from the market with grocery bags when two familiar bodyguards blocked her path.

"Mrs. Blackwood requests your presence."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the bags. Eleanor's personal guards. This couldn't be good.

"May I store these first?" She gestured calmly to her purchases.

Permission granted, she loaded the groceries into her trunk with deliberate movements. Leaning into the driver's window, she kept her voice low. "I have an unexpected meeting. Return without me—I'll take a cab later."

The driver's gaze flicked to the waiting bodyguards. "Should I alert Mr. Blackwood?"
###Chapter 74

"Unnecessary."

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile as she turned toward the two towering bodyguards. "Shall we?"

Her effortless poise left both guards momentarily speechless. Even the driver blinked in surprise.

Since when did maids carry themselves with such regal confidence?

"Move out."

Before the stunned men could react, Evelyn had already glided past them toward the waiting sedan. She slipped inside with the grace of a seasoned socialite.

The bodyguards scrambled after her, the car peeling away before the driver could process what happened.

Fumbling for his phone, he dialed Ethan Reynolds. "Mr. Reynolds—"

Meanwhile, Eleanor Blackwood waited impatiently in the restaurant's private dining room.

The door swung open to reveal Evelyn's composed figure. She took the seat opposite the matriarch without hesitation. "Good afternoon."

"So you're Evelyn Carter."

Eleanor's critical gaze swept over the younger woman's striking features. "I see the appeal now. That face could tempt any man."

No wonder Daniel was reconsidering his engagement to Serena. This maid possessed dangerous beauty.

Evelyn's fingers curled around the teacup as she took a measured sip. "Did you summon me just to compliment my appearance, Mrs. Blackwood?"

"Don't flatter yourself!" Eleanor's cane thumped against the floor. "I've never encountered such audacity!"

The older woman produced a check with a dramatic flourish. "How much is my grandson paying you? Five thousand? Six?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Something like that."

"Pathetic." Eleanor slid the check across the table. "One million. More than you'd earn in a lifetime of servitude."

Her wrinkled lips twisted in distaste. "Take it and disappear."

Amusement flickered in Evelyn's eyes as she examined the check. "How flattering. I didn't realize I commanded such value."

"It's not you who's valuable!" Eleanor snapped. "It's my future granddaughter-in-law's happiness!"

The matriarch's bejeweled fingers clenched around her cane. "If not for Serena's tears, I wouldn't have believed those photos were real. My Daniel, keeping a scheming wench like you close—"

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the necklace glittering at Eleanor's throat. "What an exquisite piece."

She'd recognized the imitation the moment she entered. Only one authentic version existed worldwide, but this counterfeit was remarkably convincing.

"Of course it's exquisite!" Eleanor preened, touching the pendant. "My future granddaughter-in-law sourced this specifically for me. One of a kind!"

Her triumphant smirk returned as she glared at Evelyn. "A lowly maid like you could never hope to touch such finery. Don't delude yourself into thinking you could join our family."

The cane pointed accusingly. "Take the money and crawl back to whatever gutter you came from!"
###Chapter 75

Evelyn picked up the check and examined it with cool detachment. "One million is quite the sum."

"Obviously," Eleanor Blackwood scoffed. "Take it and be grateful. Don’t claim I didn’t give you fair warning."

"You're right." Evelyn tucked the check into her bag without hesitation.

"But that counterfeit necklace around your neck—surely it's worth far less than a million, isn’t it?"

At the mention of a fake, Eleanor stiffened momentarily before her lips curled into a sneer. "You conniving little wretch. Just because you overheard me say my future granddaughter-in-law gave it to me, you dare call it fake?"

She glared down at Evelyn with undisguised contempt. "A lowly servant like you wouldn’t know real jewelry if it slapped you in the face. My future granddaughter-in-law has impeccable taste. She would never buy fakes!"

Eleanor’s eyes darkened with warning. "You’ve taken the money. Consider that your agreement. Find an excuse and leave Silvercrest Manor within three days. If you don’t… don’t expect mercy from me."

With that, she rose, her servant immediately at her side, and swept toward the exit.

Evelyn watched her go, then called out sweetly, "Oh, Granny? Don’t forget to settle the bill. Places like this are far too expensive for a mere servant like me."

Eleanor paused at the door, her shoulders tensing. "Disgraceful," she muttered before storming out.

Alone in the private dining room, Evelyn ordered another coffee and sipped it slowly. By the time she returned to Silvercrest Manor, night had fallen.

When she stepped inside, she found Daniel and Sophia in the living room. Daniel was absorbed in paperwork while Sophia worked on a puzzle sprawled across the rug.

The moment Sophia spotted Evelyn, she abandoned her puzzle and rushed over. "Mommy! Where were you? I was so worried!"

Evelyn crouched to stroke her daughter’s hair. "I’m fine. Just went to make some extra money."

"Extra money?" Sophia blinked up at her. "But Daddy already gives you money. Who else pays you?"

"People connected to your daddy." Evelyn smiled, then gently nudged her. "Go upstairs for a bit, sweetheart. I need to talk to your father."

Sophia pouted. "No, you two should go upstairs. I don’t want my puzzle to fall apart!"

Evelyn sighed. She didn’t want Sophia overhearing this conversation, but she did want the staff to hear every word. Staying downstairs would serve that purpose better.

Before she could argue further, Daniel’s deep voice cut in. "My study."

He shut his documents, stood, and strode toward the stairs without another glance.

Evelyn exhaled in frustration.

Daniel might be a scoundrel, but he still doted on his precious daughter from their past life.

Sophia grinned triumphantly and gave Evelyn a little push. "Go on, Mommy! Talk to Daddy!"

Reluctantly, Evelyn followed Daniel into his study and closed the door behind her.

He sat behind his desk, every inch the cold, commanding CEO. His sharp gaze pinned her in place. "Speak."

Evelyn drew a steadying breath and pulled the check from her bag, placing it on the desk.

"Mr. Blackwood, your grandmother severely underpays me. I demand a raise."

Daniel picked up the check, his expression unreadable. "A raise?"
###Chapter 76

"Yes."

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "Considering my value in the Blackwood family is a million dollars, asking for a raise isn't unreasonable, is it?"

"It isn't." Daniel set the check aside and leaned back, adjusting into a more relaxed position. His piercing eyes never left her face. "You brought this check just to negotiate a raise?"

Though he was seated and she stood, his presence dominated the room, making Evelyn feel small beneath his scrutiny.

She nodded. "Of course." Her expression remained blank. "My ambitions are modest. I just want Mr. Blackwood to increase my salary. A million dollars is excessive for a mere servant. It doesn’t sit right with me."

Daniel rose smoothly and closed the distance between them. "Is that so?"

"Obviously."

His fingers caught her chin, tilting her face up until she had no choice but to stare into those dark, fathomless eyes.

"You're not refusing this money out of guilt," he murmured, his voice low and velvety, wrapping around her like smoke. "You just don’t want to leave me."

Even now, when she swore she felt nothing for him, that voice still sent an unwanted shiver down her spine.

Evelyn jerked her head away. "Mr. Blackwood, haven’t you already figured out my motives?"

A smirk curled his lips as he backed her against the wall, his body pressing into hers. "Motives aside, that doesn’t mean you don’t still feel something for me."

Her pulse spiked the moment his skin brushed hers. It had to be the lack of contact—too long without a man’s touch. That was the only explanation.

"You're blushing." His hand slid to her waist, fingers tightening possessively. His breath was warm against her ear. "You missed this."

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut and twisted, but his grip was unyielding.

He’d learned from yesterday’s slap. This time, he left no room for escape.

Biting her lip, she willed her traitorous heartbeat to slow.

"You’re mistaken, Mr. Blackwood. My reasons for staying have nothing to do with you—or money. Didn’t your background check reveal I was a jewelry designer overseas? My annual income exceeded ten million. A paltry million means nothing to me."

Daniel stilled, his expression darkening before he abruptly released her. "Evelyn, what exactly are you after?"

"You’ll find out when the time comes."

Without waiting for a response, she strode to the door. Pausing, she threw him a cool smile. "I already promised I won’t harm Emily or speak ill of your ex-wife. Stop questioning me."

Then she was gone, the door clicking shut behind her.

Daniel remained frozen, staring at the empty space she’d left. His palms still burned where they’d gripped her waist.

Again. He’d done it again.

Gritting his teeth, he returned to his desk and pulled up the file on his computer. Photos of Evelyn Carter filled the screen, each one scrutinized with a conflicted gaze.

He shouldn’t have touched her.

Not when he barely knew her.

Not when Evelyn Carter was still alive in his mind.

After a long moment, he snatched up his phone. "Ethan, bring tomorrow’s documents. I’m working late."

Half an hour later, Ethan arrived, files in hand. "Sir, these are—"

Daniel ignored him, flipping open the first folder.

A faint smudge of lipstick marked the cuff of his white sleeve.

Ethan recognized the shade—the same deep red Evelyn had worn today.

Which meant…

His mind flashed back to the last time Daniel had worked through the night. It had been after he’d crossed the line with Evelyn.

Was he punishing himself again?

With a quiet sigh, Ethan ventured, "Sir, perhaps I should find another nanny for Emily?"
###Chapter 77

"Not yet."

Daniel exhaled sharply, his fingers drumming against the armrest. "Emily still needs her. We can't replace all the staff at once."

Ethan studied Daniel's expression, his brows knitting together. He suspected it wasn't just Emily who couldn't let go of Evelyn. Daniel was just as attached.

For nearly six years after Evelyn Carter vanished, Daniel had kept his distance from women. If Evelyn hadn't survived, Ethan might have considered Evelyn—the maid—a decent alternative. At least Emily adored her, and Daniel didn't seem to despise her.

But...

Ethan inhaled deeply, steeling himself. He had to say it. "Sir, you still have to bring the missus home."

Daniel lifted his gaze, lips curving into a humorless smile. "Are you giving me orders now?"

The ice in his voice sent a chill down Ethan's spine.

"Actually, I just remembered—I'm off the clock."

Without another word, Ethan bolted from the study, slamming the door behind him.

Alone again, Daniel stared at the photos on his screen, his chest heavy.

How could she send their daughter back and then disappear? Evelyn Carter... Where was she? Was she even alive? Why had she left without a word, only to end up in that accident?

"Daniel, what brings you here unannounced?"

The next morning, Eleanor Blackwood sat primly on the sofa in the Blackwood Estate, her smile tight as she regarded her grandson.

"Did someone talk?"

"Obviously." Daniel's voice was flat as he pulled a check from his pocket and placed it on the coffee table. "A million dollars, Grandmother. You're feeling generous."

Eleanor's face paled at the sight.

She'd expected Daniel to confront her about that maid, but she hadn't anticipated Evelyn handing over the check.

Her laugh was brittle. "I wasn't—she's under your roof, after all."

"None of my staff are worth that much." Daniel's gaze hardened. "She's just a maid. She means nothing to me. And she certainly shouldn't matter to you."

He slid the check toward her. "If you've got money to burn, donate it. But don't interfere behind my back again."

Eleanor's grip tightened on her cane. "I'm doing this for you! That maid—what does she have besides a pretty face? Serena is refined, accomplished. You're throwing away your engagement for a servant? Did you expect me to stay silent?"

Daniel leaned back, unimpressed. "Serena told you I ended things because of Evelyn?"

"Of course not!" Eleanor scoffed. "Serena is too dignified to complain. She only mentioned it in passing—said this would be her last birthday as my granddaughter-in-law. I had to pry the truth out of her!"

Her cane struck the floor. "The press caught you shopping with that maid, and two days later, you call off the engagement. You expect me to believe that's a coincidence?"

Daniel smirked. "Since when did you become so observant, Grandmother?"

Eleanor huffed. "I've always been sharp!"
###Chapter 78

"Fine, I'll play along. You actually considered using a million dollars to make Evelyn leave me based on Serena's words, but..."

"Listen carefully, Eleanor. Even if Evelyn didn't exist, even if she took the money and disappeared, I would still call off the engagement with Serena. This changes nothing. Save your money—it's useless."

Daniel rose from his seat, ready to leave.

"Daniel Blackwood!" Enraged, Eleanor snatched the teacup from the table and hurled it at him.

Crash!

The porcelain shattered at his feet, tea splattering across his trousers.

Daniel paused but didn't turn around.

Eleanor clenched her jaw. "What is wrong with you? Years ago, you defied everyone to marry Evelyn Carter into this family. She was here for years and didn't even give you an heir before that accident took her!"

"After her death, you rejected every woman we introduced. You chose Serena as your fiancée. Five years later, you're breaking it off? Are you planning to wait another six years before marrying? All I want is grandchildren—is that too much to ask?"

Daniel finally turned, his gaze icy. "If grandchildren are all you care about, you'll get them. My decision about Serena is final. Stop wasting your time."

With that, he strode out, leaving Eleanor seething.

How? How would he give her grandchildren? Evelyn had been dead for six years, and in all that time, he hadn't so much as glanced at another woman. He and Serena lived apart—they didn’t even share a bed! Where were these supposed grandchildren coming from?

The thought made Eleanor's blood boil.

Her butler handed her a mirror. "Madam, anger will only age you faster."

Eleanor caught sight of the necklace around her throat—the one Serena had gifted her, hoping she’d help eliminate that maid.

Instead, not only had she failed, but Daniel had outright warned her off!

The frustration lingered all morning.

By noon, after a nap, she felt slightly better—until a servant knocked. "Madam, Ms. Hart has been waiting downstairs for half an hour."

Grudgingly, Eleanor descended.

"Eleanor!" Serena sprang up, beaming. "How did it go? I heard Daniel came to see you this morning. What did he say?"

Eleanor sighed. "Serena, it's not that I won't help, but Daniel is—"

"Eleanor."

Before she could finish, Serena produced another velvet box. "I brought you another piece from Vincent Delacroix's collection. It matches the necklace you're wearing. Do you like it?"

Eleanor's eyes flickered to the box. She cleared her throat. "Let me... think of another approach."
###Chapter 79

"Grandmother, you're simply wonderful!"

Serena Hart eagerly handed the velvet box to Eleanor Blackwood. "Look at this, Grandmother. It's one of Vincent Delacroix's designs—part of the same collection as the necklace you're wearing. Isn't it exquisite?"

"It is stunning." Eleanor admired the piece, but then, unbidden, the words of Evelyn, the maid, echoed in her mind.

'That counterfeit around your neck probably isn't even worth half a million, is it?'

Eleanor's expression darkened slightly as she studied Serena with a hint of unease. "Serena, darling... this necklace isn’t... fake, is it?"

Vincent Delacroix had risen to fame overseas in recent years, his reputation second only to the legendary designer Moon. His abrupt departure from the industry had only driven the value of his pieces higher—what once sold for a million now fetched ten times that.

Eleanor had seen the headlines, which was why she’d given Evelyn a million on Serena’s behalf.

But that maid’s remark had lodged itself in her mind like a thorn. Every time she recalled it, discomfort prickled at her.

Could this necklace truly be... counterfeit?

No matter how well-off Serena was as Daniel’s fiancée and a rising star in entertainment, gifting jewelry worth over ten million seemed excessive.

Serena laughed lightly, brushing off the question with practiced ease. "Oh, Grandmother, don’t be silly! Of course it’s genuine. I had to pull strings just to secure this at auction."

She leaned in, her voice honeyed. "Besides, you’re far more experienced with fine jewelry than I am. You’d know instantly if something were amiss, wouldn’t you?"

Eleanor hesitated. The craftsmanship seemed flawless, but doubt lingered.

"I adore Daniel," Serena pressed on, her tone dripping with sincerity. "I only want the best for you."

Eleanor exhaled, forcing a smile. "I was merely curious, dear. I didn’t mean to imply anything."

Serena relaxed. "Good! Because for your birthday, I’m arranging something even more spectacular—Vincent’s rarest piece. It should arrive soon."

That reassurance eased Eleanor’s suspicions. "You spoil me too much."

"Grandmother!" Serena beamed. "We’re practically family. Nothing is too extravagant for you."

The moment she stepped out of Blackwood Estate, Serena yanked out her phone, her smile vanishing.

"Eleanor’s getting suspicious. We can’t risk another fake—especially not for her birthday. Get me the real thing."

A scoff came through the line. "She’s nearly eighty! What does she know? And Delacroix’s pieces cost a fortune—enough to buy a mansion. Are you sure you want to waste that on an old woman?"

Serena bit her lip.

Even with Daniel’s wealth and her own rising fame, dropping ten million on jewelry—for an elderly woman, no less—was absurd.
###Chapter 80

The realization struck her like lightning—Eleanor Blackwood was her final chance to stay by Daniel's side.

Serena clenched her jaw so hard it hurt. "Find them for me."

"No need." The woman on the phone exhaled sharply. "Vincent Delacroix didn't create many pieces to begin with. We've already purchased all the counterfeit versions of his unowned collections. The remaining authentic sets belong to private collectors. I heard Nathan Pierce of Pierce Corporation owns one set. I'll inquire."

"Fine."

Silvercrest Manor.

The relentless rain from last night left the morning air bitingly cold. Evelyn spent hours reorganizing Emily's wardrobe, carefully packing away summer clothes.

Though Emily had only been with Daniel for a few weeks, her new wardrobe already surpassed everything she'd owned in the past year.

Evelyn's back protested as she straightened up, muscles screaming from hours of bending. She collapsed onto the bed just as her phone buzzed.

Nathan Pierce's name flashed on the screen.

"Remember all those items you left with me before moving abroad?"

Evelyn frowned. "Of course."

"There's a particular set called Celestial Dreams. Someone made an offer today—ridiculously low, but they name-dropped. Claimed to represent the fiancée of Blackwood Group's CEO in Willowbrook. Said it's for Eleanor Blackwood's birthday. Wanted your approval."

A slow smile spread across Evelyn's lips. She recalled the necklace around Eleanor's neck yesterday.

She'd deliberately called it fake, knowing it would trigger Eleanor's paranoia.

So Serena couldn't maintain the charade anymore? Now she needed the real thing?

Evelyn shifted against the pillows. "Nathan, you know this collection's history. Should we sell?"

"Doesn't bother me." His chuckle rumbled through the phone. "But here's the kicker—they don't want to pay market value. Proposed two million plus a publicity stunt. They want me to announce Celestial Dreams sold for millions, making their fakes more believable."

Evelyn stilled. Clever.

First, it solved the ownership issue. Once Nathan announced the sale, Serena could spin whatever tale she wanted.

Second, this was purely about manipulating Daniel through Eleanor. If the marriage happened, authenticity wouldn't matter.

Same old Serena—always finding loopholes when cornered.

After a long pause, Evelyn sat up, watching leaves dance outside her window. "Sell it. And ship me something."

Nathan caught on instantly. "The real Celestial Dreams?"

"Don't be ridiculous." Her fingers traced the duvet's embroidery. "I crafted the originals myself. Just send materials."
###Chapter 81

The call with Nathan ended abruptly. Evelyn Carter collapsed onto the plush bedding, exhaustion weighing her eyelids down. Before she knew it, sleep claimed her.

Dreams came swiftly.

She found herself reliving that fateful spring day when she first encountered Daniel Blackwood. Golden sunlight filtered through cherry blossom petals as they danced in the breeze.

Perched beneath the flowering branches, sketchpad in hand, she'd been capturing the scene when a sudden gust scattered pink petals everywhere. That's when she saw him - a striking figure in white, his aristocratic features sharp against the soft backdrop.

He sat reading under a distant tree, his brow occasionally furrowing in concentration. Without realizing, her pencil began tracing his angular jawline and piercing gaze.

"Interesting." His deep voice startled her as he appeared behind her shoulder. The sudden interruption made her hand jerk, smearing charcoal across his portrait.

Mortified, she froze between salvaging her artwork or acknowledging his presence.

Daniel's low chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "You've made me rather unattractive." His large hands, elegant yet powerful, plucked the pencil from her grasp. He scrawled a phone number across the margin. "Fix it. Then contact me. I'm buying this."

"What should I call you?" she'd asked, meeting his intense gaze.

"Daniel," he'd replied with a mysterious smile.

"Daniel..." The name slipped from her lips as she jolted awake.

Darkness enveloped the room, broken only by pale moonlight casting eerie shadows. She touched her cheeks, surprised to find them damp.

A sudden click shattered the silence.

Evelyn gasped as light flooded the room, revealing Daniel lounging in an armchair near the doorway. His long legs were crossed with effortless grace, the sharp planes of his face accentuated by the overhead lighting.

"You were dreaming," he stated, his voice devoid of warmth.

She quickly schooled her features, wiping away residual tears. "Just a nightmare."

His lips curled into a mocking smile. "About me?"

"Don't flatter yourself, Mr. Blackwood." She swung her legs off the bed, avoiding his penetrating stare. "We're hardly close enough for that."

As she moved toward the door, he rose with panther-like grace, blocking her path with one outstretched arm. "Then why were you calling my name?"

The accusation made her pulse stutter. Under the harsh lighting, her pale complexion turned nearly translucent.

Daniel studied her with growing frustration. Awake, she maintained icy distance. Yet in sleep, she'd whispered his name with heartbreaking tenderness. This contradiction infuriated him.

"Must've been your imagination," she deflected, ducking under his arm.

He caught her wrist. "I know what I heard."

Evelyn yanked free. "Even if I overslept during work hours, docking my pay would be more appropriate than invading my privacy." Her voice turned steely. "First, it's disrespectful. Second..." She met his gaze squarely. "Should Serena hear about this, explanations would be... complicated."

Daniel's fingers gripped her chin, forcing eye contact. His gaze turned glacial. "Since when do you care about her opinion?"

"That's your concern, not mine." Her expression remained impassive. "After all, she's been your fiancée for five years."

His grip tightened momentarily before releasing. "Not anymore."
###Chapter 82

Daniel's voice cut through the air like ice. "I'm ending my engagement with Serena at Grandmother Eleanor's birthday banquet in three days."

Evelyn froze.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. "Ending the engagement?"

Why now? Was it because of Sophia? Or had he discovered Evelyn Carter was still alive?

It made no sense. Six years ago, he'd been willing to kill her just to be with Serena.

So why break it off now, after Sophia appeared?

There had to be another reason.

Unless...

Evelyn bit her lip, studying Daniel's face carefully. "Is this... because of me?"

Lately, Daniel had been finding excuses to touch her. If not for Sophia, the only explanation was that he'd developed feelings for her. That he'd grown tired of Serena.

Daniel gave a low chuckle. Instead of answering, he turned the question back on her. "What do you think?"

His tone suggested she was being presumptuous.

But to Evelyn, it sounded like confirmation. Was he admitting it without saying the words?

The realization left her with conflicting emotions.

This wasn't how she'd planned things. Yet the outcome remained the same.

What shocked her was how quickly it had happened.

Daniel's fickleness disgusted her. The man was utterly faithless. A complete cheat!

Remembering how she'd once fallen for him made her stomach churn.

She pushed his arms away and turned toward the door. "I need to make dinner for Sophia!"

Daniel watched her go without protest or pursuit.

The next morning, Evelyn was finishing breakfast when her phone exploded with notifications.

[EXCLUSIVE: Eleanor Blackwood Hospitalized Before 80th Birthday!]

[PRAYERS NEEDED: Blackwood Matriarch Still in Resuscitation!]

[Devoted Daughter-in-Law Serena Hart Keeps Vigil Outside OR]

Frowning, Evelyn opened the news app—just as rapid footsteps descended the stairs.

Daniel appeared, fully dressed, his expression grim. He headed straight for the door.

Pausing at the threshold, he glanced back at Evelyn. "Keep Sophia home today."

Against her better judgment, Evelyn asked, "Is Grandmother Eleanor...?"

Daniel smirked. "She's fine. Healthier than you, actually."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "But the news—"

"She's faking." Daniel checked his watch. "The butler warned me yesterday. Eight hours on an ER gurney? I almost feel sorry for her."
###Chapter 83

After Daniel left, Evelyn woke up and made her way downstairs.

She was still wearing her pink bunny pajamas. She fidgeted in her seat at the dining table.

"Why did Daddy leave so early?" Sophia frowned. "Mommy?"

"Hmm?"

Evelyn glanced around. Confirming they were alone, she exhaled sharply before speaking in a hushed tone. "If Mommy isn't here someday, you have to take care of yourself. Understand?"

Sophia froze, her fork hovering over her pancakes. "Mommy, why wouldn’t you be here? Are they making you leave?"

Evelyn ignored the question. "I just want you to learn to be strong."

Sophia’s lower lip trembled.

"I don’t want to be strong!" she protested, shoving a bite into her mouth. "If I’m strong, you and Liam and Oliver won’t baby me anymore!" Her small fists clenched. "I don’t want to grow up!"

Evelyn sighed, watching her daughter with weary affection.

She pulled out her phone and checked the tracking number Nathan had sent for the jewelry materials.

The package was en route from Europa to Willowbrook via express delivery.

It would arrive tomorrow—just in time. Eleanor Blackwood’s birthday gala was in two days. That left Evelyn with only one day to finalize everything.

She closed her eyes briefly, then turned to Sophia with a soft smile. "We haven’t painted together in forever, have we?"

Sophia’s eyes lit up instantly. Like Evelyn, she adored art.

But back in Europa, Sophia would lose herself for hours in the studio, forgetting to eat or sleep. Worried for her health, Evelyn had banned her from painting.

Now, at the mere mention of it, Sophia nearly toppled off her chair in excitement.

"Really? You’ll let me paint again?"

Evelyn nodded. "Finish your breakfast first. I’ll ask Daddy to set up a studio for you later."

She still needed to tweak the final details of Celestial Dreams.

"Okay!" Sophia scarfed down the rest of her food. "I’ll text Daddy right after!"

"Slow down," Evelyn chuckled, ruffling her hair. "I’m heading back to the apartment later. Want to come?"

The design drafts Liam had secretly shipped back would finally be put to use.

Grandview Medical Center

Daniel had just stepped off the elevator when Serena rushed toward him, her face streaked with tears.

"Daniel! Where have you been?" She grabbed his arm, her voice trembling. "Grandmother was in there all night! I’ve been so scared—"

He looked down at her with icy disdain before pulling away.

Near the ER doors, the butler stood guard. His expression darkened at the sight of Daniel. "Sir, this isn’t the best time."

Daniel smirked. He raised his voice. "Grandmother, I’m here. You can stop pretending now."

The hallway fell silent.

After a long pause, the ER doors creaked open.

A bleary-eyed doctor cleared his throat and launched into a rehearsed speech. "Mrs. Blackwood suffered from acute stress—"

"I know." Daniel shoved past him and strode inside.

Eleanor Blackwood lay on the hospital bed, her face pale against the stark white sheets. She feigned weakness as she looked up at him.

"Daniel... you came."
###Chapter 84

"I ended up in the hospital because you made me furious. Why haven't you fired that maid yet?"

Daniel pulled a chair beside Eleanor Blackwood and sat with effortless grace. "How much is Serena paying you to act like this? Is it really worth it?"

Eleanor stiffened at his words. "Daniel, what are you implying? Do you think I'm pretending to be sick? This is all your fault!"

He waved a dismissive hand. "If you were truly ill, I'd bring in the best specialists from abroad. But you're not."

His gaze shifted to Serena, who lingered by the door. "Your eyes are swollen from crying. Was it worth the performance?"

Serena lowered her head, biting her lip. "I was just worried about Eleanor..."

Daniel scoffed and turned back to his grandmother. "At your age, the worst thing you can do is tempt fate by pretending to be sick. Why would you willingly stay in a hospital if you're not ill? Aren't you afraid of bad luck?"

Eleanor paled.

"Enough. I know exactly how your health is. Have you forgotten I arrange weekly check-ups for you? Your last one was three days ago. High blood pressure and cholesterol—that’s all. Did you really think I’d fall for this?"

Eleanor’s face drained of color. She pressed her lips together. "I’m doing this for your own good! If you’d just listen to me and fire that maid, I wouldn’t have to resort to this at my age!"

Daniel sighed, his expression softening. "Eleanor, I’ve told you before—I won’t fire Evelyn."

"Why not?"

"I have my reasons. You’ll understand after your birthday."

Eleanor huffed. "I think you’re lying to me..."

Serena stood frozen by the door, watching as Daniel effortlessly pacified Eleanor. A bitter wave of frustration crashed over her.

Her plan had failed—again. Eleanor was her last resort.

If even Eleanor couldn’t sway Daniel, what else could she do?

Her fingers curled into fists. She despised that stupid little girl, Emily, and Evelyn—that wretched woman!

Just then, her phone buzzed. The moment she saw the caller ID, her eyes sharpened.

She slipped into the stairwell, ensuring no one followed. Once alone, she answered.

"Perfect," she hissed. "You’re sure that woman took the girl out of Silvercrest Manor? They’re back at that rented house on the outskirts?"

Her lips twisted into a cold smile. "If they’ve left the manor, make sure they never return."

In the rented house on the city’s edge, Evelyn sifted through a pile of sketches until she found Celestial Dreams.

She tugged it free, carefully replacing the others.

Then—

"Mommy!"

Emily’s panicked voice cut through the silence. "I can’t open the door!"

Evelyn’s heart lurched. She grabbed the sketch and rushed out.

Emily’s eyes were red with unshed tears. "I heard footsteps outside. When I went to check, the door was locked!"

She tugged at the handle desperately. "It won’t open!"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. Someone had locked them in.

Why?

She yanked out her phone.

No signal.

Of course.
###Chapter 85

"Sorry. The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

Liam Carter stood in the foyer of the rented house, his small fingers gripping the phone tightly as he tried to reach Evelyn again. No signal.

He attempted to contact Sophia through her necklace—still nothing.

His chest tightened.

Thirty minutes ago, Evelyn had called him, asking for help to retrieve a sketch from their rented house. He had rushed over from Grace Thornton's place immediately. Now, suddenly, he couldn't reach either of them?

Something was wrong.

His small brow furrowed.

Whether they were at Silvercrest Manor or on their way here, there was no place in Willowbrook where the signal would be completely blocked.

Unable to wait any longer, he grabbed the spare key and headed upstairs.

As he approached, he spotted a guard stationed at the entrance—a burly man with a sharp glare fixed directly on him.

Liam acted fast.

He veered toward the neighbor's door, pretending to knock while discreetly dialing again.

Still no connection.

His instincts screamed.

Evelyn and Sophia were inside. Someone had locked them in and cut off all communication.

This had Serena Hart written all over it.

His jaw clenched as he dialed Tyler Walsh. "Do you know where Daniel Blackwood is? Is he at the office?"

"No. Reception said he's at Grandview Medical Center—his grandmother's sick. Boss, what's going on?"

Liam flagged down a cab. "Emergency. I'm sending you the address. Get here and watch the place. If anything happens, call me immediately. Have Dominic meet me at Grandview. I need to find Daniel Blackwood now."

The urgency in his voice made Tyler snap to attention. "Got it. On my way."

Liam hung up, exhaling sharply as the cab sped off.

The driver glanced at him through the rearview mirror, curious. "You're pretty young to be running errands alone. How old are you?"

Liam barely spared him a glance, but the man looked harmless—just a chatty middle-aged guy.

"Six," he muttered.

"You live around here?"

"Yeah."

"Be careful, kid. It's been dry lately. There've been a few fires in this neighborhood. If you're home alone, keep an eye out."

Liam froze.

"Fires? Recently?"

The driver nodded. "Yeah, just last week."

His blood ran cold.

"Drive faster. Please."

The driver didn't question it—just pressed harder on the gas.

A ten-minute trip took five.

The cab screeched to a halt outside Grandview Medical Center. Liam didn't wait for change—just bolted inside.

Dominic Shaw was already waiting in the lobby.

"Boss, what's the situation?"

"No time."

Liam sucked in a breath, demanded Eleanor Blackwood's room number, then grabbed Dominic's arm.

"Carry me. Ninth floor. Now."

Hospital elevators were too slow.

Every second counted.
###Chapter 86

Liam didn't question Dominic as the bodyguard hoisted him onto his back and sprinted up the stairs.

Young and strong, Dominic made it to the ninth floor in minutes.

The moment they arrived, Liam's phone rang.

"Boss," Tyler's voice crackled through the line. "The house you told me to watch—it's on fire. There are too many guards. I couldn't get close, but I've already called it in. What now?"

Liam's vision nearly darkened.

Disaster didn't wait.

Guards at the door, flames inside. If he went after Daniel now, would he even make it in time?

Liam stormed into Eleanor Blackwood's hospital room, jaw clenched. "Tyler," he ordered, "document everything. Get clear footage of every single person guarding that door."

They would pay. Every last one of them.

Meanwhile, inside the ward...

Eleanor, still bedridden, fixed Daniel with a stubborn glare. "Daniel, if you don't give me a proper explanation today, you're not leaving."

"Grandmother, don't blame Daniel," Serena interjected, dabbing at her eyes with a tissue. "It's all my fault..."

Tears streamed down her cheeks, but her eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

The fire should have started by now.

As long as she and Eleanor kept Daniel here, within ten minutes, that wretched Evelyn and her daughter would suffocate.

In half an hour, they'd be nothing but ashes.

The thought made her nearly giddy. She forced another sob. "I just... I don't have the fortune to be your granddaughter-in-law..."

Daniel exhaled sharply, irritation flickering. Serena's hatred for Evelyn was no secret. She wanted her gone—but dragging Eleanor into it was too far.

Evelyn was just a maid. Why did Serena feel so threatened?

"Daniel!" Eleanor snapped. "Look at how heartbroken Serena is! The least you could do is hand her a tissue. Even if you're calling off the engagement, is basic decency too much to ask?"

Daniel's brow furrowed. With a sigh, he reached for the tissue box.

Before Serena could take it—

BANG!

The door burst open.

Liam charged in, his gaze landing instantly on Daniel offering tissues to Serena.

Rage ignited in his chest.

His mother and sister were burning alive, and this worthless father was comforting their murderer?

Liam lunged forward, snatching the tissues away. "Mr. Blackwood!" he snarled. "Why are you coddling her? Do you realize your daughter and my mother are about to die in that fire?"

Daniel stiffened. "What did you say?"

Sophia and Evelyn weren't home. How could they—

"No time!" Liam's grip on Daniel's wrist tightened. "If you want them alive, come with me now! Bring backup! Any later, and it'll be too late!"

Serena shot to her feet. "Who are you?" she demanded. "What kind of nonsense are you spewing?"

This brat was ruining everything.

Liam's glare could have melted steel. "You." He pointed at her. "I'll deal with you later."

Then he turned back to Daniel, desperation sharpening his voice.

"Are you coming or not? We have to save them!"

Daniel stared at him, unmoving.
###Chapter 87

The acrid scent of smoke choked the air.

Evelyn's lungs burned as thick black clouds filled every corner of the apartment. Flames licked at the walls, devouring stacks of sketches—her life's work—in seconds.

She had no time to wonder who wanted her dead. Survival was the only thought in her mind. Sophia had to make it out alive.

Wrapping her daughter in a soaked blanket, Evelyn's hands moved swiftly. She found a length of rope and secured it around Sophia's small frame. "Remember the emergency drills Uncle Nathan taught you?"

Sophia clung to her, tears streaking her soot-covered face. "But I won't go without you! I'd rather stay—"

"Listen to me." Evelyn's voice was firm despite the tremor in her chest. "I'm lowering you to the balcony below. An elderly couple lives there—kind people. Get inside, call Oliver, then the police. Don’t leave their apartment until help arrives. Do you understand?"

She couldn’t risk Serena’s men spotting Sophia. If Serena was willing to kill, she wouldn’t hesitate to finish the job.

"Mommy..." Sophia sobbed as Evelyn carried her to the window. "I should've listened to Oliver. I never should've let you come back."

She had hoped for reconciliation. A family. Instead, she was watching her mother fight for her life—again.

Evelyn smoothed Sophia’s hair with trembling fingers. "I would’ve come regardless. Now go. I’ll be right behind you."

Sophia wiped her eyes and gripped the rope. Slowly, she descended.

Nathan’s training had been brutal, but Sophia had always been the quickest learner. She moved with precision, her small hands steady despite the terror.

Evelyn watched from the window, coughing violently, her throat raw from shouting for help. She couldn’t draw attention—not until Sophia was safe.

The fire roared louder.

Heat seared Evelyn’s skin as the flames closed in. The crackling of burning wood mixed with her ragged breaths.

Finally, the rope went slack. Sophia had made it.

Evelyn slumped against the wall, exhaustion dragging her down. The toxic air burned her lungs. Her vision blurred.

Was this how it ended?

She had underestimated Serena. Once her closest friend, now her executioner. And Daniel—she had thought him the villain. But Serena? She was worse.

They deserved each other.

Darkness crept at the edges of her sight. Then—a crash.

The door splintered open.

Daniel burst through the flames, his face twisted in panic. He scooped her into his arms without hesitation.

This had to be a hallucination.

Yet his embrace felt real. Familiar. Warm.

Tears spilled down her cheeks.
###Chapter 88

Only in Evelyn's dreams did Daniel ever show her such tenderness.

She had loved him for years, yet he'd never once returned her feelings.

But in this dream, she could feel his concern wrapping around her like a warm embrace.

"You'll be fine."

That deep, familiar voice kept repeating the words as she drifted between consciousness.

Evelyn's lips curved into a bitter smile. If only she could stay asleep forever...

When she finally woke, morning light streamed through the hospital windows. The sharp scent of antiseptic hit her before she even opened her eyes.

She forced her heavy eyelids apart, blinking against the sterile brightness.

The ICU.

Her gaze immediately landed on the figure in the adjacent bed—a man with an oxygen mask covering half his face. Even unconscious, his sharp features commanded attention. The sunlight softened the usual harshness of his expression, making him look almost vulnerable.

Daniel Blackwood.

"Miss Carter, you're awake!" A nurse hurried to her side. "Don't move. I'll fetch the doctor."

"Wait." Evelyn's voice came out hoarse as she pointed to Daniel. "What happened to him?"

The nurse hesitated. "Your husband was stabbed confronting the men outside the fire. Despite his injury, he carried you through the flames to safety."

A pause. "He lost significant blood. The wound became infected, compounded by smoke inhalation. His condition is... precarious."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

Why? Why risk himself for her now?

Six years ago, when she'd been his wife, he'd discarded her without hesitation for Serena Hart.

Now? He'd nearly died saving a mere maid.

Was she finally worth something to him? Or had she simply meant nothing before?

The questions cut deeper than any blade.

The doctor arrived, performing a swift examination before approving her transfer to a standard ward.

As the nurse wheeled her out, Evelyn's eyes lingered on Daniel's still form. Without thinking, the words slipped out:

"If you don't wake up soon, Daniel Blackwood, Evelyn Carter will disappear from your life forever."

The threat tasted hollow even as she said it. What power did her name hold over him?

The elevator doors began closing when suddenly—

"Stop!" Another nurse came running. "Mr. Blackwood's awake. He's demanding to see the woman who just spoke to him."
###Chapter 89

Evelyn was wheeled back into the ICU once again.

The room buzzed with medical staff. A pale man in a hospital gown sat rigidly on the bed, his eyes burning with barely contained rage.

"Bring her here."

Though his voice was weak, the command carried undeniable authority.

Evelyn slid off her bed with care. Leaning on the nurse for support, she approached him slowly.

"Mr. Blackwood, you wanted to see me?" Her voice made Daniel's jaw tighten.

He turned sharply. His gaze was like ice shards piercing through her.

"Was that you earlier?"

"Yes."

"Explain yourself." Flames seemed to dance behind his eyes. "Do you know Evelyn Carter's whereabouts?"

Evelyn folded her arms, meeting his glare without flinching. "I don't. I only said it to shock you awake."

She tilted her head. "Seems it worked rather well."

"You—!"

Daniel lunged forward. IV needles tore from his skin, sending crimson droplets spraying across the floor. Monitors crashed down as he closed the distance between them.

His hands locked around Evelyn's throat, slamming her against the wall.

"You're lying! You know where she is!" His entire body trembled with fury. "Tell me!"

Though gasping for air, Evelyn's stare remained glacial. "I. Don't. Know. I just needed you conscious." She flicked her eyes to the frozen medical team. "Are you all going to let him strangle me?"

The doctors sprang into action, grabbing Daniel's arms. Yet five grown men couldn't budge the enraged patient.

Daniel kept Evelyn pinned, his grip unrelenting. "I've warned you about my boundaries. No one jokes about Evelyn Carter. No one uses her against me." His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "No one even speaks her name carelessly."

The raw intensity might have convinced strangers of his devotion. But Evelyn knew better.

She laughed, the sound choked but mocking. "You protect her from others? How about from yourself, Mr. Blackwood? Haven't you hurt her enough?"

Daniel went rigid.

Evelyn pressed on. "I had no ill intent. Yet you accuse me of harming her?" She gave a bitter smile. "Funny. Evelyn willingly returned Sophia, yet stays hidden. Could it be... she's hiding from you?"

The words struck like a physical blow. Daniel's hands slackened.

Was that why? Because she remembered his betrayals?

As Daniel faltered, the doctors finally wrestled him back to bed. He lay motionless, staring blankly at the ceiling while they reattached his IVs.

The nurse rushed to Evelyn's side. "Are you okay? He looked ready to murder you."

Evelyn rubbed her throat. "Did he?"
###Chapter 90

Evelyn offered the nurse a weak smile before being wheeled back to her room from the ICU.

"True." The nurse sighed. "I'd always heard Mr. Blackwood never stopped loving his ex-wife, but I thought it was just gossip. I mean, he got engaged to her sister right after her death. How deep could that love really be? But now... it seems he genuinely did."

Evelyn leaned against the bed frame, listening. A bitter smirk curled her lips.

This was exactly the image Daniel wanted—everyone believing he was still hopelessly devoted to Evelyn Carter. He had spun his lies so well, even he seemed convinced.

He claimed no one was allowed to speak ill of Evelyn or hurt her.

Yet, in the end, he had been the one to destroy her the most.

She exhaled, closing her eyes briefly before lifting her head. "How long was I out?"

"Two days."

"Did anyone come to see me?"

The nurse adjusted the IV drip. "Yes. A little boy and his godmother visited."

She smiled warmly. "That boy is quite the charmer. If I had a daughter, I'd want him as a son-in-law someday!"

Evelyn chuckled softly. "Anyone else?"

"Oh, right. There was also a little girl with her great-grandmother," the nurse added, inserting a needle into Evelyn's arm.

Evelyn stiffened. "A little girl... and her great-grandmother?"

"Mm-hmm. The old lady looked stern, but she doted on that child like she was the most precious thing in the world."

Evelyn's vision nearly darkened. Who else could it be but Eleanor Blackwood?

Which meant the Blackwoods now knew about Emily.

Once the family found out, even if Evelyn executed her plan perfectly, taking Emily back would be nearly impossible.

Just as despair threatened to swallow her, a petulant little voice echoed down the hallway.

"Why did you separate them? I like Daddy and Aunty together! I want to see them both at the same time!"

A doctor responded helplessly, "Little Princess, rules are rules. The woman isn’t critical anymore, so she had to be moved."

"Hmph!" Emily's voice carried clearly.

Evelyn sighed in relief. At least her daughter was unharmed. She had managed to protect her that day. Maybe she wasn’t such a terrible mother after all.

"Aunty!"

Moments later, Emily burst into the room, her white chiffon dress fluttering as she sprinted toward the bed. She grabbed Evelyn’s hand eagerly.

"Are you better now? Great-Granny told me you woke up, so I came right away!"

Evelyn tensed. "Great-Granny..."

"She's been staying with us these past few days," Eleanor Blackwood's icy voice cut in from behind Emily.

The older woman still wore the necklace Serena had given her. Her sharp gaze pinned Evelyn in place.

"You saved Emily, so the Blackwoods owe you gratitude. But in your current state, you're in no condition to care for her. The butler will settle your payment. Find another job once you're discharged."
###Chapter 91

"Great-Granny!"

Sophia's small hands clutched Evelyn's finger tightly, her lips trembling. "I told you I only want Aunty Evelyn! If you make her leave, I'll never forgive you!"

Eleanor Blackwood's aristocratic features hardened before she forced a practiced smile. "Darling, you're a Blackwood heir. You can't become attached to household staff."

Her icy gaze shifted to the butler. "Take Miss Sophia to the gardens. I need a private word with Ms. Carter."

Sophia's grip tightened like a vise around Evelyn's arm. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks. "No! Aunty stays with me! Anyone who separates us is my enemy!"

The elderly matriarch's expression darkened at the child's defiant words. For years, Daniel had kept women at arm's length, making Eleanor fear she'd never see the Blackwood lineage continue. Then this miracle great-granddaughter appeared.

Yet this precious child clung to a servant like a lifeline. Worse, Daniel himself showed unusual interest in the woman - rushing into burning buildings for her, fighting off assailants. The last woman who'd inspired such reckless behavior was Evelyn Carter herself.

Eleanor's jaw tightened. History would not repeat itself.

"Remove her," she commanded the butler.

When the servant hesitated, Evelyn gently pried Sophia's fingers loose. "Go play, sweetheart. I'll see you soon."

Sophia's wails echoed through the hospital corridor as the butler carried her away. The door clicked shut, sealing Evelyn inside with the family's most dangerous predator.

"You've bewitched my entire household," Eleanor hissed, settling into an armchair like a queen holding court. "First my great-granddaughter, now my grandson. I won't tolerate a gold-digging servant turning them against their own blood."

Evelyn met the accusation with calm defiance. "Your imagination runs wild, Mrs. Blackwood."

"Does it?" The older woman's cane struck the floor with a crack. "That child would choose you over her own family. And Daniel...he hasn't risked his life for anyone since-"

"Since you drove his last love to suicide?" Evelyn's quiet interruption hung between them like a guillotine blade.

Eleanor's face purpled with rage. "You'll leave tonight. Name your price."

Evelyn smiled, the expression not reaching her eyes. "I don't want your money."

"Then what do you want?" The question came out as a snarl.

The door burst open before Evelyn could answer. Daniel stood framed in the doorway, his stormy gaze sweeping from his grandmother to Evelyn. Sophia squirmed in his arms, her tear-streaked face lighting up at the sight of her beloved caretaker.

"Great-Granny was being mean to Aunty!" the child accused.

Daniel's voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "We'll discuss this at home, Grandmother."

Eleanor rose with regal poise, though her knuckles whitened around her cane. The battle lines had been drawn - and for the first time in her reign over the Blackwood dynasty, she faced opponents who wouldn't crumble under her threats.
###Chapter 92

"My heart belongs only to Sophia."

"You care for her?" Eleanor Blackwood scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "Don't make me laugh! You're just using that child. Before I knew of Sophia's existence, I never realized how calculating you could be. Manipulating a little girl's affection to secure your place in Silvercrest Manor."

She narrowed her eyes. "Playing the doting caretaker while seducing Daniel behind the scenes. Such a pretty face masking such ugliness beneath!"

Evelyn had anticipated this confrontation. A soft chuckle escaped her lips. "Your imagination is quite vivid, Eleanor. Pity none of it's true."

Her gaze dropped to the necklace around the older woman's throat. "More gifts from Serena, I see?"

This piece matched the previous fake from the same counterfeit collection.

Eleanor's hand flew protectively to the jewelry. "Serena has exquisite taste. Far superior to yours!" She lifted her chin. "More importantly, she's Sophia's real aunt by blood. You could never measure up. Given the choice, I'd welcome Serena into our family without hesitation."

She leveled a cold stare at Evelyn. "As for you - name your price. We both know you're only here for the Blackwood fortune. One million not enough? State your demands, but don't overreach."

From her hospital bed, Evelyn studied the poorly crafted necklace with amusement. "Greed does have its limits. Even million-dollar necklaces lose their charm when they're... inauthentic."

Eleanor's face flushed crimson as she tucked the necklace beneath her collar. "Enough games! What will it take to make you leave?"

Evelyn closed her eyes briefly before meeting Eleanor's glare. "I'll go. But I don't want your money. Just one condition."

"Which is?"

"I leave after your birthday gala."

She'd known this arrangement couldn't last. First, it deviated from her original plan. Second, living under Daniel's watchful eye increased the risk of exposure - he'd already suspected something in the ICU earlier.

But she couldn't depart until after the gala, when Daniel would publicly acknowledge Sophia as his heir. Only then would the child be safe.

Once Sophia's lineage was officially recognized, Serena would think twice before acting. Any harm to the girl would immediately point to her aunt. Even Serena wasn't foolish enough to invite that scrutiny.

Eleanor's lips curled in triumph. "Agreed." Then, with malicious delight: "Serena's presenting me with Vincent Delacroix's rarest jewel at the gala. You should stay - witness true luxury firsthand. Perhaps then you'll reconsider your accusations."

Evelyn smiled. "I look forward to it."

She was eager to see how far Serena would take this charade. More importantly - it was time to settle their unfinished business.
###Chapter 93

The moment Eleanor Blackwood stepped out, little Sophia burst into Evelyn's hospital room. She locked the door behind her and threw herself into Evelyn's arms, tears streaming down her face.

"Mommy, I don't want to leave you! Please don't listen to Great-Grandma. I'll figure something out—I won't let them take you away!"

Evelyn sighed, shaking her head. "Sweetheart, don't waste your energy on this."

She gently cupped Sophia's face. "You have to grow up someday, don't you?"

Sophia sniffled but stayed silent, her small hands clutching Evelyn's hospital gown.

"Don't be afraid," Evelyn murmured, brushing away her daughter's tears. "I won't let anything bad happen to you. Once things calm down, you'll be safe with the Blackwoods. Your father may be... difficult, but he cares for you. And your great-grandmother loves you too—I can see it."

Sophia scowled, her tiny lips trembling. "She doesn't! If she did, she wouldn't try to separate us!"

"Adults have complicated reasons for the things they do," Evelyn said softly.

She understood Eleanor's concerns. Sophia was the Blackwood heiress—precious, irreplaceable. No aristocratic family would tolerate their golden child clinging to a mere maid.

"I don't care!" Sophia stomped her foot. "If she makes you leave, I'll never speak to her again!"

Evelyn exhaled, stroking Sophia's hair. The girl was stubborn, just like her father. After more coaxing, she finally convinced Sophia to return to the Blackwood Estate.

By the time Sophia left, night had fallen.

A nurse entered with dinner, setting the tray in front of Evelyn before turning on the TV. "Bored in here?"

Evelyn offered a faint smile, then froze as Serena Hart's face filled the screen.

Serena beamed at the cameras. "There have been ridiculous rumors about my fiancé, Daniel Blackwood, being hospitalized. Let me clarify—he's perfectly fine. He's simply a very private man. Our relationship has never been stronger, and our wedding plans are proceeding smoothly."

She held up her right hand, flashing a dazzling ring. "Daniel gave me this just days ago."

The reporters gasped.

"Is that one of Vincent Delacroix's custom pieces?"

"The pair sold for millions overseas! To think Mr. Blackwood acquired one!"

Evelyn barely glanced at the screen as she ate.

That ring was a fake.

The real one was with Nathan Pierce.

If Serena was flaunting it this brazenly, the deal was done. She'd not only bought the counterfeit Celestial Dreams collection but also secured the ring.

Evelyn was lucky.

Among the files Nathan had sent her, there were enough details to recreate the ring.

She grabbed her phone and texted Liam.

At first, his replies were frantic with worry. Then they turned serious.

[The fire destroyed almost everything. Godmom said the house was hers all along—she's transferring it to you. But all our overseas belongings are gone. The sketches you wanted burned, but I can get digital copies from Uncle Nathan.]

A pause. Then—

[Mom... Daniel knows you're my mother now. We have to be careful.]
###Chapter 94

At just six years old, Liam spoke with the wisdom of someone decades older.

Evelyn let out a soft sigh. "I've decided to leave Silvercrest Manor after Eleanor Blackwood's birthday celebration."

"Are you planning to leave Emily behind?" Liam asked.

"Yes."

"Then we need to deal with Serena Hart first."

Liam's response was immediate. "I had Tyler gather crucial evidence. Even if that coward won't act, I'll take it to the authorities. Serena's going to prison for years."

Evelyn exhaled deeply. Her son always understood far more than any child should.

"Try to comfort Emily these next few days. She doesn't want me to leave. Since you suggested she return to Daniel, you should handle this."

A long silence followed before Liam abruptly changed the subject. "Grace has returned," he said, ending their conversation.

Moments later, Evelyn's phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Oliver.

"Mom, I'll take care of Emily. She listens to me most. You and Liam focus on the Serena situation."

Oliver rarely messaged her. Staring at the screen, Evelyn sighed. "Thank you."

"No problem."

Another message followed.

"Mom, I don't care how long I live, but I worry about you. About Liam and Emily too. You've suffered so much, yet refuse Nathan's help. I fear you'll never be happy. Liam's brilliant but impulsive. He misses the bigger picture and it'll cost him eventually."

"Emily's too emotional, always throwing tantrums. My reason to keep fighting is knowing you three are safe. But if my survival makes you miserable, I'd rather—"

Evelyn's eyes snapped shut. Her fingers trembled as she typed, "Don't say that. We'll find a cure. We'll all be happy."

The room suddenly felt airless. After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn slipped out of bed and into the hallway.

Grandview Medical Center at night was eerily quiet compared to its daytime bustle. Wrapped in a hospital gown, Evelyn wandered aimlessly until she found herself outside Daniel's room.

Through the glass, she saw him. IV still attached, he studied documents with intense focus. From her angle, she could see his sharp profile—regal, commanding, effortlessly handsome.

The sight transported her to their first meeting. Even now, with her feelings changed, she couldn't deny he still looked like every fantasy she'd ever had.

"Evelyn." Ethan's voice startled her. "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence."

When she looked again, Daniel had set aside his papers. His lips formed two silent words: "Come in."
###Chapter 95

Evelyn trailed behind Ethan into the room.

Daniel lounged against the headboard, his fingers brushing aside a stack of documents before lifting his gaze to meet hers. "You've been watching me from the hallway for twelve minutes."

A faint smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Mr. Blackwood, you're so captivating I couldn't look away."

Daniel neither acknowledged nor dismissed her words.

Instead, he reached for the steaming cup beside him, his long fingers curling around it as he took a slow sip.

"Captivating enough to spy on me at this hour?"

His dark eyes locked onto hers. "Want some?" he murmured, his lips still glistening.

With a cool smile, Evelyn stepped forward and accepted the cup. She drained it in one go. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood."

The warmth spread through her chest, but it did nothing to thaw the ice in her heart.

"I heard you promised Eleanor you'd leave Silvercrest Manor." Daniel's gaze sharpened, unreadable. "Did you get what you wanted by staying close to me?"

"No." Evelyn sank into a nearby chair, crossing her legs. "Not even close."

"And yet you're still leaving?"

"Yes." A soft laugh escaped her. "I thought you'd be thrilled. I'll be gone after Eleanor's birthday celebration."

Daniel's eyes narrowed.

She had fought tooth and nail to stay near Sophia before. Now, after he'd nearly died saving her from the fire, she was ready to walk away at a word from his grandmother.

This woman was a puzzle—one he couldn't resist unraveling.

"If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave." His intense stare made her skin prickle.

Evelyn stood, flashed him a smile, and turned toward the door.

Her fingers had just grazed the handle when his voice cut through the silence.

"Won't you miss it?"

Evelyn scoffed internally. "I'll miss Sophia, of course."

"Just Sophia?"

"What else is there?"

Daniel's jaw tightened, but he said nothing more.

"Get some rest, Mr. Blackwood. You were unconscious for days. Pushing yourself now would be reckless—unless you're aiming for an early grave."

Then she was gone.

The moment the door clicked shut, Ethan slipped inside. "Sir, should we begin searching for a replacement?"

Daniel closed his eyes. "Not yet."

He wasn't ready to let her go.

Morning light spilled through the windows, crisp and golden.

Liam sipped his juice, then slid a tablet across the table. "Mr. Blackwood, I asked you here to show you something."

Daniel frowned as the screen flickered to life—footage of burly men loitering outside Evelyn's door during the fire.

The next image froze his blood.

Serena, sitting across from them, handing over what looked like payment.
###Chapter 96

The tablet screen displayed a collection of videos and photos from the Skywheel incident. Serena appeared in every single piece of evidence.

Daniel's eyebrows knitted together as surprise flickered in his gaze. "You managed to gather all this?"

Liam was merely six years old.

Most children his age would still be crying over spilled milk in preschool, yet this boy could not only articulate his thoughts with precision but also compile such substantial evidence?

Even most adults would struggle with this level of private investigation. How had he accomplished it at such a tender age?

"Tyler and Dominic assisted me, but their capabilities were limited."

Liam seemed to read Daniel's thoughts. He gave a casual shrug. "Alone, I wouldn't have secured this much proof, but..."

The boy narrowed his eyes at Daniel. "I'm just a child, and they're merely bodyguards. Our combined efforts could only go so far. Mr. Blackwood, had you genuinely investigated this matter, you'd have uncovered the truth long ago. The Skywheel incident happened ages ago, yet you've taken no action. That speaks volumes."

A mocking smile played on Liam's lips. "Truthfully, Mr. Blackwood, you don't care about your daughter as much as you claim, do you?" Though his voice retained its childish pitch, his diction and tone belonged to someone far more mature.

Daniel offered a faint smile. "I have my reasons."

"Interesting." Liam pressed his lips together. "Your reasons don't concern me. I'm showing you this because you need to know - I have evidence. Evelyn is my mother, and Emily is your daughter. This woman has attempted to kill them both twice. As the adult here, you should be handling this. But if you remain unwilling..."

The boy's gaze hardened. "I'll take this to the police station and file charges myself."

At six years old, Liam knew the authorities would question the evidence's validity.

Tyler and Dominic lacked the finesse for such matters. Grace lived peacefully, and Liam refused to involve her. After careful consideration, Daniel became the obvious choice.

Moreover, this served as a test - to determine whether Emily or Serena held more importance to Daniel.

If he still protected Serena, then Liam would know those heartfelt computer writings were nothing but lies.

"Leave this to me." Daniel understood the unspoken challenge.

He set the tablet aside calmly. "Are there copies?"

Liam nodded. "Several."

"Delete them." Daniel's voice turned steely. "I have what I need. You've done enough. Don't create unnecessary complications."

"You realize if this leaks, with her resources, she'll trace it back to you. You're living with your godmother. Do you really want to drag her into this?"

Liam studied Daniel intently. "Then promise me you'll make her pay."

The boy feared no consequences for himself, but Grace's safety was non-negotiable.

Even Evelyn wouldn't want her friends endangered. This very principle had prevented Liam from acting against Serena earlier.

"You have my word." Daniel met the child's gaze without flinching.

"I promise."
###Chapter 97

Daniel studied Liam with an unreadable expression. "I hope you won't regret this decision, Mr. Blackwood."

With deliberate movements, Liam pulled out his phone and permanently erased the cloud backup.

This was his gamble. He was betting everything on Daniel's willingness to eliminate Serena for Sophia's sake - and for Evelyn.

Those disturbing files he'd discovered on Daniel's computer last time still haunted him.

Maybe now he'd finally get his answer. Did Daniel truly love Evelyn? Or was it all just self-deception?

Watching the evidence disappear, Daniel's lips curved slightly. "Such faith in me?"

Liam's eyes gleamed with cunning. "Are you implying you're untrustworthy, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Just wondering," Daniel mused, swirling his coffee. "What if I lied earlier? What if I have no intention of touching Serena?"

The boy took a deliberate sip of juice before answering. "Then you'll lose everything that matters."

Placing the empty glass down, Liam slid off the chair. "If we're done here, I'll take my leave."

Without waiting for a response, he turned and walked away, small hand raised in casual farewell. Not once did he look back.

Ethan stared after the retreating figure, stunned. "Since when do six-year-olds act like that?"

The child carried himself with more composure than most adults. Terrifying, really. And if this was Evelyn's son... Ethan suddenly understood why Daniel found her so formidable.

Daniel took a measured sip of coffee. "I was worse at his age."

Ethan barely suppressed an eye roll. Of course the genius would say that. Brilliant minds and all that nonsense.

Clearing his throat, Ethan gestured to the tablet. "Should we deliver this to the authorities?"

"Not yet."

Daniel picked up the device, studying the damning evidence with cold precision.

"Just keep close watch on Serena. We won't move against her... for now."

Ethan blinked. "We're doing nothing?"

He'd always maintained professional respect for Serena as Daniel's longtime fiancée. But this? Two confirmed attempts on Sophia's life?

And Daniel wanted to let it slide?

"You disagree?" Daniel's voice carried a dangerous edge.

"N-no, sir." Ethan hesitated before blurting, "But Ms. Hart committed attempted murder. By not acting, aren't you enabling her?"

Daniel's eyes shut briefly, fingers drumming the table. "Evelyn made a valid point. If she returned Sophia yet refuses to see me... I must have hurt her deeply."

"But ignoring Ms. Hart's crimes and endangering Sophia further - wouldn't that disappoint Evelyn more?"

"Hmm."

A humorless smile played on Daniel's lips. "What would you do in her position?"

"Take Sophia and disappear," Ethan answered without hesitation.

Daniel's eyes snapped open, pinning Ethan with their intensity. "Exactly."

He stood abruptly. "Triple security. Monitor Serena's every move. And protect Sophia at all costs."

With that, Daniel strode from the café, leaving a bewildered Ethan in his wake. What game was his boss playing now?

Meanwhile, Evelyn marveled at Oliver's mysterious ability to comfort Sophia. For two days straight, her daughter visited without tears or tantrums, even promising to "be good."

This sudden maturity left Evelyn strangely hollow. With Sophia's crisis resolved, only one problem remained - Serena Hart. And this time, Evelyn wouldn't hold back.
###Chapter 98

Serena's sudden disappearance these past days was baffling. No trace of her could be found anywhere.

News outlets reported she'd fallen ill, canceling all professional commitments to rest at home.

Even prestigious award ceremonies—events she never missed—were skipped without explanation.

Daniel's men claimed Serena remained secluded in her residence, guarded by his personal security team.

Evelyn froze when she heard the update.

Daniel's men protecting Serena? Why? Were they worried someone might harm her?

Please—as if Serena hadn't been the one orchestrating everything from the start.

The thought made Evelyn's lips twist into a bitter, mocking smile.

It seemed Daniel only showed such meticulous care for those he truly cherished.

Even after Serena's repeated attempts on his daughter's life, he still prioritized her safety. Canceling her engagements. Deploying guards.

His actions mirrored those of the man who'd once killed Evelyn to protect Serena.

Hadn't history repeated itself six years ago? Why should she still be surprised?

"Evelyn."

A knock interrupted her thoughts. She quickly tucked away her phone and glanced up.

Ethan stood at the hospital room door, dressed in his usual white coat.

She frowned. "What do you need?"

"Tomorrow is Eleanor Blackwood's birthday gala." He cleared his throat. "Mr. Blackwood requested you take Sophia shopping today. She'll need appropriate attire for the event. He plans to formally announce her identity as a Blackwood heir during the celebration."

"Understood." Evelyn had already intended to prepare Sophia. After tomorrow, her daughter would remain with the Blackwoods indefinitely.

The gala would mark both Sophia's official introduction to high society and the beginning of their separation.

Determined to make their last day together memorable, Evelyn took Sophia to the upscale Willowbrook Galleria. Given past incidents, she arrived with a full security detail.

Overseas, work had always consumed Evelyn's time. Mother-daughter shopping trips were rare luxuries.

Inside the mall, Sophia buzzed with excitement, darting between displays like an overjoyed hummingbird.

Until—

"Oof!"

"Whose child is this? She nearly knocked me over!"

"I-I'm sorry..."

Evelyn abandoned the shoes she'd been examining and rushed toward the commotion.

"What happened?"

Tearful, Sophia buried her face in Evelyn's coat. "I didn't see the lady... I bumped into her..."

Evelyn sighed, smoothing her daughter's hair. "You should watch where you're going." She turned to help the fallen woman up. "Ma'am, are you—"

The familiar voice stopped her cold.

Evelyn's hands froze mid-reach. Her breath hitched.

The woman Sophia had collided with was none other than Victoria Sinclair—her mother.

"Mom? What's taking so long?" Serena's voice called from a nearby boutique.
###Chapter 99

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat as Victoria's voice rang out clearly across the bustling mall. "I'm here."

Every fiber of Evelyn's being screamed at her to grab Sophia and leave immediately. Confronting Serena in front of Victoria was the last thing she should do. Yet her feet remained rooted to the polished marble floor, as if weighted down by invisible anchors.

Six years. Six long years since she'd last laid eyes on the woman who gave her life. The elegant middle-aged woman before her was unmistakably her mother, though time had etched new lines around her eyes.

A bitter dryness filled Evelyn's mouth. Words tangled in her constricted throat, refusing to form coherent sentences.

Serena's sharp voice sliced through the tension. "What's going on here?" Her perfectly sculpted eyebrows arched when she spotted Evelyn and Sophia standing before Victoria.

A cruel smirk twisted Serena's lips. "Well, isn't this a delightful coincidence?"

Daniel had confined her to Silvercrest Manor for days following their last confrontation. Only by using Victoria's visit as an excuse had she managed this shopping excursion. Of all the cursed luck - running into Evelyn and the child on their first stop.

Victoria blinked in surprise. "Serena, you know these people?"

"Know them?" Serena gave a humorless laugh. "Mom, this is the brat I told you about. Emily."

Victoria's entire demeanor transformed. She crouched down with surprising agility, reaching for the little girl hiding behind Evelyn. "This is Lulu's baby?"

Noticing Sophia's hesitation, Victoria turned on her most grandmotherly smile. "Don't be scared, sweetheart. I'm your grandma!"

Without waiting for permission, Victoria pulled Sophia into a tight embrace. "Such a precious girl!"

Evelyn watched, her heart fracturing into a thousand pieces. After Evelyn Carter's supposed death six years ago, Victoria had severed all ties with Willowbrook. She'd refused to attend even Serena's engagement to Daniel, unable to stomach the Blackwood family who'd destroyed both her daughters.

Only Serena's urgent call about Evelyn's child returning had finally drawn Victoria back. She'd planned to reconnect with Sophia after the birthday gala, but fate had other plans.

Victoria's hands trembled as she held Sophia at arm's length, drinking in every detail. "Let Grandma look at you properly, Emily!"

Sophia's wide eyes darted to Evelyn, silently pleading for guidance. Evelyn gave the slightest nod, her chest constricting.

"Grandma," Sophia whispered obediently.

Victoria burst into tears. "Oh, my sweet girl!" She crushed Sophia against her again, weeping openly. "Grandma's just so... so happy!"

Evelyn swallowed against the lump in her throat. During her years abroad, her parents had been the only ones she truly missed.

When she'd first regained consciousness after the accident, she'd begged Nathan to investigate her parents' condition. The report had shattered her - her mother nearly died from grief, while her father lost his prestigious position and scraped by on menial jobs.

She'd wept for days in that sterile hospital room, drowning in guilt. Her parents were perhaps the only people on earth who'd genuinely loved and mourned her.

Yet her thirst for vengeance had kept her from contacting them even after the triplets' birth. Nathan had promised to watch over them while keeping their condition from her, knowing any updates might weaken her resolve.

Six years. Half a decade of stolen moments and suppressed longing. Now her mother stood before her, alive and breathing, with no recognition in her eyes.

Victoria finally looked up at Evelyn, mistaking her for hired help. "You're Emily's nanny, yes?"

Evelyn's nod came slowly, each movement painful. "Yes, ma'am."

"I'm her grandmother," Victoria said, as if explaining to a simpleton. Something flickered in her eyes as she studied Evelyn's face. "You look... familiar somehow."

Victoria shook off the thought and continued, "I know your job is to care for Emily, but I'd like to take her for lunch. I mean no harm, I just..."
###Chapter 100

Evelyn avoided Victoria's gaze. "Sophia is my firstborn's child. I don't even know if my daughter is still alive. I just want to spend time with my granddaughter. Please?"

Serena scoffed, crossing her arms. "Why ask her? You're the grandmother. Since when do we need a maid's permission for family matters?"

Victoria whirled around, eyes blazing. "This is her responsibility! Of course I should ask!"

She turned back to Evelyn with an apologetic smile. "Forgive my daughter. We've indulged her too much."

Evelyn stood frozen, heart pounding. Once, Victoria had doted on her like this too. Now, she was nothing but an outsider.

Once permission was given, Victoria scooped Sophia into her arms, heading for the hotel restaurant. Evelyn and Serena trailed behind.

"You're pathetic," Serena sneered, eyeing Sophia's small frame. "Almost died multiple times because of that brat. Yet here you are, still playing nanny." She leaned closer, voice dripping with malice. "Face it. You'll never be family."

Evelyn kept her head down, fingers tightening around her sleeves.

"Don't worry," Serena smirked, glancing at the distant staff. "I can't touch the little demon right now. Daniel's too protective." Her lip curled. "Thanks to you."

If not for this meddling maid, she'd have rid the world of Evelyn Carter's bastard long ago.

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "She's six years old."

Serena laughed coldly. "And?"

Age didn't matter. The child was a nuisance either way.

At the table, Victoria handed Sophia the menu. "Can you read, sweetheart? Pick anything you like."

Sophia hesitated, then pointed decisively. "Caramel pudding, please."

Victoria's face lit up. "Your mother adored these! She'd always beg for one when we dined out."

Sophia peeked at Evelyn. "Actually... it's for Auntie. She likes them."

She'd secretly read Evelyn's journals. Knew how much she missed sharing desserts with her mother. Maybe this could heal that ache, even just a little.

Victoria's smile faltered. She turned to Evelyn. "You enjoy them too? My daughter..." Her voice cracked. "I warned her not to marry Daniel Blackwood. A man like that would never cherish her. But she wouldn't listen. Chose him over me..."

Evelyn stared at her lap, tears burning. "What a coincidence."

Victoria sighed. "That stubborn girl..."
###Chapter 101

Victoria's voice trembled with sorrow.

"What a shame."

"Evelyn was such a wonderful girl..."

"Mother." Serena cut in sharply beside her.

"The server is waiting for your order."

Serena despised when Victoria spoke of Evelyn.

From childhood, Evelyn had been Victoria's golden child.

Serena had spent her entire life in Evelyn's shadow, and as she grew older, her resentment festered into open hostility.

"Ah, I'll finish ordering."

Serena's interruption snapped Victoria back to reality.

She sighed deeply before consulting Sophia about her food preferences.

Her gaze kept drifting toward Evelyn, who sat with her head bowed.

"Do you enjoy spicy food, miss?"

"Yes," Evelyn answered quietly.

She couldn't bring herself to meet Victoria's eyes.

Inside, she was shaking.

Six years of longing, six years of separation—yet she couldn't reveal herself.

Not now.

Not when Oliver still needed her.

The pain of this moment was Daniel and Serena's doing.

Her fists clenched at the thought.

Once Oliver was healed, they would pay.

"That's everything."

After placing their order, Victoria turned her attention back to Sophia.

She kept pressing for details about Evelyn's whereabouts.

Sophia glanced at Evelyn before answering carefully.

"Mommy said... she still has important things to do."

"When she's finished, she'll come home."

Then, with wide, innocent eyes, Sophia added, "She promised to have caramel pudding with you when she returns!"

Victoria's eyes welled up.

She discreetly wiped away a tear.

"That foolish child. What could possibly be more important than seeing her own mother after six years?"

"Perhaps her priorities lie elsewhere."

Serena feigned sympathy while secretly rolling her eyes.

"Maybe family just isn't that important to Evelyn."

Victoria paled.

The previous night, when Serena told her Evelyn was alive—that she had sent Sophia back—Victoria hadn't slept a wink.

She couldn't comprehend it.

Evelyn had always been devoted, always kind.

Why would she cut ties with her family after surviving the accident?

Why wait six years to send Sophia back?

Why announce her survival through a child but never show her face?

What could possibly justify this?

And why send Sophia straight to Daniel?

Didn't she fear for her daughter's safety in his care?

Victoria had agonized all night with no answers.

Now, Serena's words twisted the knife deeper.

"Mother, don't upset yourself."

Noticing Victoria's distress, Serena pressed on mercilessly.

"Evelyn has always been this way, hasn't she?"

"When we begged her not to marry Daniel, she refused. She even fought with us over it."

"If I hadn't intervened later, she would have severed all ties with the family!"

Victoria exhaled shakily.

Sadness clouded her expression.

"Yes."

"She was always so stubborn."

"Our opinions never mattered to her."

"Let's not speak of this anymore."
###Chapter 102

Evelyn turned away, continuing her conversation with Victoria.

In the corner, Serena's fists clenched beneath the table as she listened.

It wasn't true. None of it was. Evelyn had never forgotten her parents.

She had always longed for home.

When she married Daniel, she never intended to fight with her family. It was Serena—her most trusted sister—who had orchestrated it all.

Serena had whispered to her, "Evelyn, don't worry. Go ahead and marry Mr. Blackwood. I'll stay here with Mom and Dad."

"They say they're cutting ties, but they're just trying to scare you. They still love you—don’t you remember?"

"Follow your heart. I’ll handle everything here."

How could Evelyn have doubted her own sister? So she married Daniel and moved to Willowbrook, blissfully unaware.

It wasn’t until her father appeared at the gates of Silvercrest Manor that she realized the truth.

Serena hadn’t smoothed things over—she had made them worse. She had told their parents that Evelyn was the one who wanted to sever ties.

Evelyn had confronted her, furious. But Serena had dropped to her knees, sobbing, claiming she was young and had mishandled things.

Foolishly, Evelyn believed her. She even comforted Serena for hours.

Until the day she overheard Serena gloating about what she’d done.

Only then did Evelyn understand—her rift with her parents had been Serena’s doing all along.

"Grandma."

Sophia had been quiet in Victoria’s arms for a long time before finally speaking.

"Mommy hasn’t forgotten any of you."

Her voice was small but firm.

"She misses home so much. She keeps your and Grandpa’s pictures hidden on her computer. And she cries every time she eats caramel pudding."

Sophia looked up at Victoria’s face.

"Mommy has something very, very important to do right now. That’s why she can’t come back yet."

Serena’s eyes darkened.

That little brat. Always getting in her way. She should have pushed harder on the Skywheel that day.

"I see." Serena forced a smile, though her gaze was icy. "Then tell me, Sophia—what could possibly be so important that your mother can’t even visit her own parents?"

"I can’t tell you." Sophia pressed her lips together.

After a pause, she lifted her chin.

"But Grandma, when Mommy comes back, you’ll understand. I know you will."

Victoria sighed, stroking Sophia’s hair. "You defend your mother just like she used to defend others. Too understanding for your own good."

Serena’s jaw tightened.

Years. It had been years since Evelyn left.

Yet Victoria still smiled with pride at the mere mention of her.

What about her?

No matter what Serena did, Victoria never saw her as Evelyn’s equal. She was always the reckless one, the disappointment, forever compared to her perfect sister.

She had finally convinced Victoria of Evelyn’s betrayal last night.

And now?

One conversation with Sophia, and Victoria was wavering again.

Serena’s nails dug into her palms.

"I still don’t understand," she said coldly. "What could possibly be more important than family?"

Evelyn set down her teacup with deliberate calm.

"Some things are." Her voice was quiet but sharp.

Serena frowned. "Like what?"

Evelyn met her gaze.

"Revenge."
###Chapter 103

Serena Hart's rage erupted instantly.

Evelyn Carter wanted revenge? For what? Against whom? Was she targeting her? How dare she! Serena should have strangled Evelyn with her own hands! That driver throwing her into the ocean was too merciful! If Serena had handled it personally back then, Evelyn wouldn’t have survived, let alone given birth to that wretched child! Fury twisted Serena’s features.

She scoffed, tilting her head. "You speak as if someone wronged my sister." With deliberate elegance, Serena tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.

"She disappeared without a word. Betrayed Daniel. No one harmed her—who exactly is she avenging?" Her icy gaze locked onto Evelyn, sharp with venom. "You’ve never even met her. What gives you the right to judge? How presumptuous."

Sophia Carter, seated beside Victoria Sinclair, bristled at the insult. Deliberately loud, she interrupted, "Grandma, I want more of this!"

Victoria startled, then quickly served Sophia another portion. "Serena, enough. The child is present."

Serena rolled her eyes. "I’m stating facts."

Victoria’s brow furrowed. "Silence." She turned to Evelyn, softening. "My daughter has always been blunt. Pay her no mind."

Evelyn’s throat constricted at her mother’s weary face.

"But," Victoria sighed, spooning soup for Sophia, "Serena isn’t wrong. No one hurt her. She vanished without explanation, didn’t contact us for six years. It’s... heartbreaking."

Evelyn’s lips trembled. She studied her mother’s gaunt cheeks. The words tore free before she could stop them. "You... think she was in the wrong?"

Victoria blinked, startled.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "Working with Mr. Blackwood, I’ve heard rumors about his ex-wife. I assumed they were just gossip. But after today..." She feigned casual curiosity. "What kind of person was she?"

She needed to know. Her mother had always understood her best. Evelyn refused to believe Victoria would buy the lies Serena and Daniel spun—that she’d cheated, fled, and died in an accident.

Yet she was wrong.

Victoria’s smile was sad. "Lulu was wonderful, but... people err, don’t they?" She stirred the soup absently. "Perhaps that man treated her so well she forgot her family." She nudged Sophia. "Does your mommy’s friend treat her kindly?"

Sophia, oblivious to the tension, beamed. "Uncle Nathan is nice! To Mommy and me!"

Victoria’s shoulders relaxed. "As long as she’s happy..."

Serena smirked. "See? Stick to your duties. You know nothing about my sister." Her voice dripped with disdain.
###Chapter 104

"Serena, have some." While Victoria was feeding Emily, she placed slices of prosciutto onto Serena's plate.

"You've lost weight recently." Serena barely acknowledged Victoria's concern.

She didn't even thank her before picking up her fork and eating quickly.

Evelyn kept her head down, fighting back tears.

She had no strength left to argue with Serena.

This was how her own mother saw her now.

After six years apart, everything had changed.

The woman who once believed in her without question had been completely swayed by Serena.

She no longer trusted Evelyn.

If only her mother would give her just a little more faith, she'd see through Serena and Daniel's scheme.

It was full of holes.

If only her mother held on a bit longer, Evelyn might find the courage to secretly reconcile.

She'd been away from her mother for too long.

She wanted to collapse into her arms and sob.

Distrust. Misunderstanding. Estrangement.

They formed an impenetrable wall between them.

Evelyn had no choice but to keep wearing her mask, remaining a stranger to her own mother.

The meal tasted like ash in her mouth.

As she set down her fork, her phone buzzed.

"Bring Emily back after you're done." Daniel's voice was icy.

"My son informed me you're aware of Serena's true feelings toward Emily."

"If you knew, why would you dare take her to dine with them?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

She glanced back at Victoria, who was happily playing with Emily.

"Ms. Sinclair is here. I thought since Emily just returned from abroad, she should spend time with her grandmother—"

Daniel scoffed. "Since when did you grow a conscience?"

Evelyn's brows furrowed. "Since when did I not have one?"

"Certainly not when dealing with me."

"Mr. Blackwood, you must be joking. How could I possibly—"

The line went silent for several beats before he spoke again. "Just bring her back. No matter how much Victoria adores Emily, she'll always bring Serena along."

"Understood."

After hanging up, Evelyn drew a shaky breath.

She approached Victoria. "Mr. Blackwood wants me to take Emily home now."

Victoria reluctantly set Emily down. "I won't keep you. Go ahead."

Evelyn gave her mother one last meaningful look before scooping Emily into her arms and striding away.

"Let's continue shopping. Didn't you want that new dress?"

"Yes, Mother. I'll buy one for you too."

"I'm not as vain as you—"

Evelyn quickened her pace, but their conversation still reached her ears.

Once certain they were out of sight, she broke into a run.

She didn't stop until their voices faded completely.

Emily reached up with tiny hands, wiping her mother's tears.

"Mommy, you're crying."
###Chapter 105

Evelyn Carter didn't remember how she made it back to Silvercrest Manor.

Her chest ached. Her nose stung.

Her thoughts were completely numb.

That evening, Liam had briefed her about exposing Serena the next day when Daniel would reveal Sophia's true identity.

"Mommy."

Liam's voice came through the video call, his brows furrowed.

"Are you okay?" Evelyn forced a steady breath.

"Just tired."

"You saw Grandma today, didn't you?" Emily, clutching her stuffed bear beside her, piped up. "She cried."

Then Emily's expression darkened.

"Grandma was nice to me, but she made you sad. I liked her at first, but not anymore. Just like Great-Grandma Eleanor. She's—"

"Emily." Evelyn cut her off sharply.

"Bedtime."

Even if Victoria didn’t believe her, she was still her mother. She wouldn’t tolerate anyone speaking ill of her—not even her daughter.

Emily’s face fell.

"Sorry, Mommy. I didn’t mean to be mean about Grandma."

She’d only spoken honestly, but if it upset Evelyn, then she’d messed up.

"I won’t do it again."

Seeing her daughter’s remorse, Evelyn’s heart twisted. She pulled Emily into her arms.

"I’m not mad. I’m just... not myself tonight."

"I know." Emily patted her back gently. "I’m your comfort blanket. You have to feel better, okay?"

"If you’re Mommy’s blanket, then what am I? Her quilt?" Liam’s voice carried envy through the screen.

"No way. I have to be bigger than you!"

"Then I’ll be Mommy’s weighted comforter," Oliver chimed in through Emily’s necklace, his tone teasing.

Listening to her three children, Evelyn felt warmth seep through the cracks in her heart.

"It’s summer. Why would I need so many layers?"

Emily pouted.

"Fine! I’ll be Mommy’s handheld fan!"

Liam grinned. "Then I’ll be her ceiling fan."

Oliver sighed dramatically. "Guess that makes me the AC unit."

Emily and Liam groaned.

"Why do you always have to one-up us?"

"Because I’m objectively superior?"

The bickering started instantly.

Evelyn sat cross-legged on the rug, listening as the weight in her chest slowly lifted.

The past six years had taken so much from her—love, family, every connection she’d spent two decades building.

But not everything.

She’d gained a new life. A confidant like Nathan.

And...

Evelyn glanced down at Emily, still arguing with her brothers.

She’d gained Oliver’s quiet wisdom, Liam’s sharp mind, and Emily’s endless warmth.

Her throat tightened. She pulled Emily closer.

"Promise me you’ll take care of yourself. If anything happens, you call me or your brothers immediately."

Tomorrow, she’d resign from Silvercrest Manor.

Her real life was waiting.

"I promise!" Emily cupped Evelyn’s face. "You have to take care of yourself too. Eat properly. Look after Oliver and Liam. I’m six now—I’ll be good!"

Liam snorted through the screen. "Says the six-year-old who still believes in tooth fairies."

Oliver’s chuckle floated from the necklace. "Pot calling the kettle black. We’re triplets, genius."
###Chapter 106

Daniel exhaled sharply, grinding his cigarette into the ashtray.

Sophia crossed her arms with a triumphant smirk. "Oliver always treats me better than you!"

His jaw tightened. "When he recovers, I'll take him out for ice cream. Just the two of us."

Evelyn sighed, pulling Sophia into a hug. "Sweetheart, don't tease your brother."

Through the video call, Liam pouted dramatically while Evelyn adjusted the necklace connecting her to Oliver.

The warm glow of Sophia's bedroom framed them—a mother and daughter wrapped in quiet affection.

Outside, Daniel leaned against the gazebo, watching through the French windows.

His fifth cigarette burned between his fingers.

He didn’t understand this restless irritation coiling in his chest. Evelyn was leaving Silvercrest Manor tomorrow. The thought shouldn’t bother him this much.

Yet here he was, staring like some lovesick fool.

First, she’d been upset. Then laughing through tears. Now, that reluctant resignation darkened her eyes.

She didn’t want to leave Sophia.

But she would.

Why?

He lit another cigarette, the flame flickering in the night.

This woman was a paradox. She clung to self-imposed rules like armor. One word from her, and he’d let her stay. But she never asked.

Not once.

Was it because of how he’d treated her before?

The memory of Evelyn Carter six years ago surfaced—bright-eyed, relentless in her devotion. She’d wanted to share every thought, every moment with him.

He’d found it suffocating.

Then, one harsh outburst later, she’d shut down. The vibrant woman became a ghost in his home. Still loving, but silent.

He’d assumed it was a phase.

She never spoke freely to him again.

Daniel exhaled smoke bitterly. Were all women this unforgiving?

Or just the ones he hurt?

Snuffing out the cigarette, he dialed Ethan.

Thirty minutes later, a groggy knock sounded on Evelyn’s door.

Ethan yawned. "Mr. Blackwood wants to know if you’re extending your stay."

Evelyn arched a brow. "And?"

"He’s waiting in his study."

"Noted." She shut the door.

Ethan blinked. "That’s it?"

Her muffled voice came through. "Goodnight, Ethan."

"You’re not going?"

"I’m busy sleeping."

Ethan groaned. Daniel had dragged him back to the manor under false pretenses, and this was the thanks he got?
###Chapter 107

Two hours later, he couldn't stand it anymore.

Daniel shut his laptop with a sharp click and dragged his hands down his face.

She hadn't come.

She really wasn't going to stay.

All this time, he'd been fooling himself.

A bitter laugh escaped him as he pushed away from his desk.

He needed air.

Without realizing it, his feet carried him to Evelyn's door.

Dark.

She must have gone to bed already.

His chest tightened as he exhaled slowly and turned toward Sophia's room.

Fast asleep.

Of course.

Seemed he was the only one in Silvercrest Manor who couldn't sleep tonight.

The only one dreading tomorrow.

Back in his room, Daniel pulled out the photo hidden beneath his pillow.

Evelyn Carter's smile stared back at him.

His thumb traced the curve of her lips.

Then he laughed—harsh, humorless.

"Come home soon." His voice was rough. "If you don't..."

He might actually move on.

The thought made him squeeze his eyes shut.

What was wrong with him?

When he'd believed Evelyn dead, he'd sworn to love only her forever.

Six years.

Six years of keeping that promise.

He'd thought he could keep going.

Then she walked back into his life like a storm.

He knew Evelyn was alive. Knew he should be focused solely on finding her.

But...

That night, sleep never came.

Daniel clutched the photo to his chest, wrestling with himself—denying, justifying, bargaining.

By dawn, he'd made his choice.

Morning arrived unchanged.

Evelyn left early, determined to finalize her plans for the evening.

She carried the materials Nathan had sent her into the fire-damaged room she'd converted into a makeshift studio.

Two days.

That's all it had taken to recreate the Celestial Dreams collection.

She'd even crafted one piece in full.

Now, she inspected the finished jewelry one last time before tucking it into her bag.

When she returned to Silvercrest Manor, the clock read 10 AM.

Serena was waiting at the gates.

Dressed in a sapphire-blue gown, hair swept up, she lounged in the driver's seat of her crimson Porsche.

The window rolled down as Evelyn approached.

Serena's smirk was razor-sharp. "Heard today's your last day?"

Evelyn didn't break stride.

"Pity." Serena's voice dripped venom. "I warned you what happens to people who cross me."

Still walking.

"I almost liked you." A bitter laugh. "But you had to side with that little brat."

Evelyn froze.

Turned.

Serena's smile widened. "Smart girl like you? Had you chosen me, you could've been the most valued servant in this house."

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists.

"You're proud of bullying a six-year-old?" Her voice was ice. "Then I'm glad I chose wrong."
###Chapter 108

Serena's face darkened instantly at Evelyn's words.

She flung the car door open and stepped out.

Her heels clicked sharply against the pavement as she marched toward Evelyn.

"Say that again, I dare you!" Serena hissed, her voice dripping with venom.

Evelyn met her glare without flinching. "Repeating it won’t change a thing."

Serena's eyes raked over Evelyn’s plain servant uniform, her bare face, the simplicity of her appearance.

Pathetic.

Yet those piercing eyes—cold, unyielding—made Serena feel small.

It was the same look Evelyn Carter used to give her.

The memory sent a surge of fury through Serena’s veins.

If she couldn’t crush Evelyn Carter, she sure as hell wouldn’t let some servant humiliate her.

Her lips curled into a sneer.

She lunged forward, her designer heels giving her height as she swung her hand toward Evelyn’s face.

But Evelyn was faster.

Her fingers clamped around Serena’s wrist mid-air, stopping the slap with effortless precision.

"Violence is the last resort of the weak," Evelyn said coolly.

Then she shoved.

Serena stumbled back, her expensive dress scraping against the pavement.

Dirt smeared the delicate fabric.

Her hair tumbled out of its perfect updo.

She looked like a mess.

"Evelyn!" Serena scrambled to her feet, her voice shaking with rage.

She glared at Evelyn’s retreating back.

"If I could destroy Evelyn Carter, I can destroy you too! Don’t think leaving Silvercrest Manor means you’re safe. You’re nothing but a servant. I’ll make sure you don’t last a week in Willowbrook!"

Evelyn didn’t even turn around.

She simply waved a dismissive hand.

"Looking forward to it."

Then she stepped inside, leaving Serena fuming on the driveway.

By the time Evelyn returned to Silvercrest Manor, lunch was nearly ready.

She had hoped for one last meal with Daniel, but he was nowhere in sight.

"Auntie!"

Emily’s bright voice pulled her attention to the dining table.

The little girl beamed and waved her over.

"Everything okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Everything’s fine."

"Good!"

Emily grabbed a plate and started piling food onto it.

"You’ve taken care of me all this time. Now it’s my turn."

Her big, round eyes sparkled with determination.

"Don’t say no. I’ve been practicing!"

She picked up a spoon and carefully held it out to Evelyn.

Evelyn couldn’t help but chuckle.

"All those nursing videos… this was why?"

Emily grinned sheepishly. "Did I do good?"

No matter what, Emily didn’t want Evelyn to leave.

The thought made Evelyn’s chest tighten.

She pulled Emily into a sudden hug.

"Emily," she whispered, her voice thick.

"You don’t have to take care of anyone. Just take care of yourself, okay?"

Emily nodded.

Then her gaze flickered toward the doorway—and froze.
###Chapter 109

Evelyn froze when she noticed little Emily had stopped eating. Following the child's gaze, she turned toward the doorway.

Daniel stood there, looking utterly exhausted.

His usually impeccable suit was wrinkled beyond recognition. Dust clung to his disheveled hair. Yet somehow, this disarray only accentuated his rugged masculinity.

Her eyes dropped to the small box in his hands.

That box... it looked hauntingly familiar, though she couldn't quite place where she'd seen it before.

"Daddy! Where were you?" Emily abandoned her fork and scrambled toward the kitchen. She returned moments later, carefully balancing a plate of food. "You're just in time for lunch! Our last meal together before Auntie leaves."

The child immediately corrected herself. "I mean... the last lunch before Auntie Evelyn goes."

Daniel's gaze flickered to Evelyn as he set the box down. With rough movements, he loosened his tie and tossed his jacket over a chair.

Rolling up his sleeves, he picked up the box again and approached.

Now Evelyn could see the extent of his dishevelment - not just his jacket, but his entire shirt was coated in a thick layer of dust. The kind that accumulates over years in forgotten places.

She bit her tongue.

It wasn't her place to ask where he'd been. She meant nothing to him. His comings and goings were none of her concern.

"Daddy, what's that?" Emily eyed the box curiously as Daniel placed it gently on the coffee table.

"Your dress for tonight's event."

Emily's nose scrunched in confusion. "But Auntie Evelyn already bought me a dress yesterday." They'd even run into Grandmother Eleanor during that shopping trip.

Daniel's fingers hovered over the box lid. "I know. But last night, I realized you should wear this instead."

With a soft click, he opened the box.

Inside lay a delicate pink dress, every stitch perfection.

Emily gasped, her small hands flying to her mouth. "Wow!"

It was breathtaking - far more exquisite than anything they'd seen at the mall.

The child reached out tentatively, then pulled back. "Where did this come from, Daddy?"

Daniel's expression softened as he ruffled her hair. "I went to Verdant Heights today. Where your mother used to live."

Evelyn's fork clattered to the floor.

Daniel glanced at her but continued, unfazed. "I suddenly remembered something. Before we married, your mother and I dreamed about having a daughter."

His fingers traced the dress's lace trim. "She designed this. Learned to sew just to make it."

Evelyn sat rigid in her chair.

Now she remembered that box.

She'd packed it carefully before her wedding, intending to bring it to Silvercrest Manor. But Serena had sneered at it, calling the dress "cheap." So she'd left it behind.

And now, after all these years, Daniel had gone back for it.
###Chapter 110

After a long moment of hesitation, Evelyn decided to leave the dress in her tiny apartment.

It had been years.

She'd completely forgotten about its existence.

Memories flooded back as she recalled sewing every stitch with trembling fingers.

That version of Evelyn Carter had been brimming with dreams—of building a life with Daniel, of becoming the happiest woman alive.

Reality had crushed those fantasies with brutal force.

"Auntie?" Emily's voice snapped her back to the present.

The little girl stood before her, twirling in the delicate dress.

Emily beamed, lifting the hem with childish delight.

"Do I look pretty?"

The image superimposed itself over Evelyn's old daydreams.

Something sharp twisted in her chest.

She swallowed the lump in her throat, forcing a smile.

"Absolutely stunning."

"Then it's settled!" Emily spun across the living room, her laughter ringing.

"Wearing Mommy's dress to Daddy's big party! I can't wait!"

Daniel's stern expression softened as he watched them.

He washed his hands and settled at the dining table, cutting into his steak with practiced elegance.

Emily demanded a full-length mirror, admiring her reflection from every angle.

"It's perfect, isn't it?" Daniel murmured, watching Evelyn's reaction.

She nodded stiffly.

"My wife always had impeccable taste."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Her gaze snapped to his.

"Why this sudden change? You just took her dress shopping yesterday."

Verdant Heights was hours away.

The dark circles under Daniel's eyes betrayed his midnight drive—there and back in relentless haste.

His attention remained fixed on Emily's joyful prancing.

"I realized Evelyn should witness tonight's announcement." His smile turned rueful.

"If she's watching... I want her to see our daughter in this dress."

A pause.

"To fulfill that old promise. And..."

His voice dropped.

"To prove I never forgot her words. That she's still..."

Evelyn's blood turned to ice.

The realization struck like a physical blow.

This was a trap.

The dress, the sentimentality—all calculated to lure Evelyn Carter from hiding.

To manipulate her into believing his lies.

Some things never changed.

Her fists clenched as she watched Emily's innocent joy.

"Six-year-olds understand more than you think," Evelyn said coldly.

"She'll despise you when she realizes you're using her."
###Chapter 111

"Daddy, Aunty, what are you discussing?"

Sophia noticed Evelyn and Daniel staring at her. She skipped over, her smile radiant as morning sunshine.

Daniel exchanged a glance with Evelyn. He reached out to ruffle Sophia's hair. "Just admiring your dress. Do you like it?"

"I love it!" Sophia chimed, her voice like wind chimes. "Mommy made this specially for me!"

As she twirled, a decorative piece from her dress fluttered to the floor.

Evelyn frowned. "Stop fidgeting."

Sophia froze instantly.

Evelyn retrieved the fallen ornament. "Fetch me the sewing box."

"Okay!" Sophia dashed to retrieve it.

"Do I need to take it off?" Sophia tilted her head curiously.

"Not necessary." Evelyn's fingers found the hidden compartment effortlessly, retrieving needle and thread. "Turn around."

Sophia obeyed.

With practiced movements, Evelyn reattached the ornament, her stitches precise. She exhaled deeply when finished, inspecting her work before storing the supplies.

This dress held memories. She'd crafted it during her early tailoring days, when her skills were still unrefined. Examining it now revealed numerous imperfections.

As she replaced the box, she met Daniel's piercing gaze.

"You handle that box like it's familiar," he observed.

He'd personally retrieved it from Verdant Heights, from Evelyn's abandoned residence. Both the apartment and box had been coated in dust, untouched for years. Yet Evelyn had known exactly where to find the sewing supplies.

Interesting.

Where the old Evelyn might have faltered under his scrutiny, this version remained composed. "I apprenticed as a seamstress. This dress shows an amateur's hand - simple construction, basic techniques." She shrugged. "Most people store sewing supplies in the same compartment. Nothing remarkable."

Her eyes challenged him. "What's truly surprising is how little you knew about your late wife's hobbies. Weren't you the devoted husband, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel stiffened.

He couldn't deny his past neglect. "I wasn't present when she made this," he admitted quietly.

"Just this dress?" Evelyn pressed.

In truth, he'd never accompanied her anywhere - not even prenatal appointments. She'd excused his absences, believing him consumed by work. She'd even recommended Serena as his assistant to ease his burden.

How that decision had backfired.

Evelyn could picture them now - every "business trip" an opportunity for their affair. She'd been the world's greatest fool.

"Evelyn."

Daniel's voice cut through her thoughts. His expression darkened. "You overstep. Don't mistake today's leniency for permission to pry into my personal affairs."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "My apologies. I didn't realize such innocent questions would strike a nerve, Mr. Blackwood."

She rose, offering a mocking curtsy. "Forgive my impertinence, sir. It won't happen again."

Without waiting for dismissal, she ascended the staircase.

Daniel's frown deepened as he watched her retreat. The woman grew bolder by the day.

"Daddy, don't be mad at Aunty." Sophia tugged his sleeve cautiously. "She's sad about leaving me tomorrow. Please be kind to her."
###Chapter 112

Daniel lowered his gaze. The sparkle in his daughter's eyes melted his hardened heart.

He pulled Emily into his arms. "You're too trusting."

How could Evelyn possibly be upset about leaving?

She was the one who demanded to go. He'd given her every chance—waited all night, and she hadn't even bothered to show up.

Why put on this act now, pretending to be reluctant?

With a sigh, Daniel straightened. "Let's eat. After lunch, I'll have Ethan take you to choose a new nanny, alright?"

Emily bit her lip but nodded. "Okay."

Once Mommy left, she would need someone to look after her. Even though Emily believed she could manage on her own, her brothers and mother insisted she have proper care.

After the meal, Ethan escorted Emily to a meeting room in Silvercrest Manor.

A line of women stood at attention, waiting.

"Little miss, these are the candidates for your nanny. Mr. Blackwood said the choice is yours."

Emily studied them carefully.

Too tall—no.
Too frail—no.
Too stern—no.

Then her gaze landed on the fourth woman. Her breath caught.

It was Isabelle—the nanny who had worked at Uncle Nathan's estate!

Isabelle recognized her too, offering a discreet wink.

Emily pointed instantly. "Her!"

Ethan blinked in surprise.

This woman was slight, delicate—nothing compared to the more robust candidates. Why had Emily chosen her so quickly?

But Emily wasn't done. Scanning the remaining women, she spotted two more familiar faces—servants from Nathan's household.

She selected them as well.

"Just as decisive as your father," Ethan remarked, impressed, before dismissing the others.

Whether choosing Evelyn or these women, Emily acted with unwavering certainty—just like Daniel.

Once alone, Emily hurriedly led Isabelle and the others upstairs.

Evelyn was still packing when they entered.

At the sight of the three newcomers, she gave a tired smile. "New hires?"

"Not exactly." Before Emily could explain, Isabelle stepped forward. "Ms. Carter, it's us."

That voice—

Evelyn spun around.

Standing behind Emily were three women from Nathan's staff—the very ones who had cared for her children before!

Shock and joy flooded her. "What are you doing here?"

"Young Master Oliver sent us," Isabelle said warmly. "He was worried about his sister, so he arranged for Mr. Pierce to bring us."

Evelyn's throat tightened. Oliver might be quiet, but his love for his siblings ran deep.

She swallowed hard. "Nathan agreed to this?"

"He did," Isabelle confirmed. "Mr. Pierce personally escorted us to Willowbrook."

Evelyn's pulse jumped. "He's here? Where?"

If Nathan was in town, why hadn't he reached out?

"He said you'll see him tonight," Isabelle assured. "Don't worry."

A thrill shot through Evelyn.

Tonight?

"Will he be attending Eleanor Blackwood's birthday banquet?"
###Chapter 113

Evelyn led little Sophia back to her room before slipping into the garden to call Nathan.

The moment he answered, his deep chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "You met Isabelle?"

She exhaled sharply. "I can't believe you brought them here yourself."

"Business brought me to Willowbrook," he said smoothly. "They tagged along. It wasn't planned."

"Really? What a convenient coincidence."

A pause. Then, his voice dropped lower. "Fine. I missed Liam and Emily. And... maybe you a little."

Her pulse stuttered.

After a beat, she forced herself to speak. "Are you attending Eleanor Blackwood’s banquet tonight?"

"Mmm." His tone darkened. "I want to see the faces of those who hurt you."

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. There were so many things she wanted to say, but the words tangled in her throat.

Finally, she managed a quiet, "See you tonight, then."

"Looking forward to it."

Just as she moved to end the call, Nathan murmured something that made her freeze.

She pretended not to hear, hanging up abruptly.

Turning, she collided with a pair of icy eyes.

Daniel Blackwood leaned against a marble pillar, arms crossed, watching her with a storm brewing in his gaze.

"Your boyfriend?" His voice was dangerously calm.

Evelyn tilted her chin up. "Yes."

His jaw tightened. "Since when?"

"Since always."

In a flash, he closed the distance, slamming her against the pillar. His grip was iron, his breath hot against her lips.

"If you always had a boyfriend," he growled, "why did you come to my house? Why play the obedient servant? Why tempt me at every turn?"

Evelyn laughed, the sound sharp.

"Mr. Blackwood, I told you from the start—I’m here for Emily. Not you. As for seduction? That’s all in your head."

His fingers dug into her wrists.

She smirked. "You’re wealthy. Handsome. But not every woman falls for you."

Once, I did. Evelyn Carter had been that woman—the one who loved him blindly. And it destroyed her.

Daniel’s eyes blazed. "You’re saying you never wanted me? Never tried to lure me in?"

"Never—"

His mouth crashed onto hers.

The kiss was brutal. Possessive. One hand pinned hers above her head while the other locked her against him.

She gasped, stunned.

He had never kissed her like this before.

Six years ago, she had been the one begging for his touch, desperate for any scrap of affection. He’d grown cold, refusing even to kiss her during intimacy.

But now—

His tongue invaded her mouth, claiming, punishing.

By the time she gathered her wits, it was too late.

As his anger burned through the kiss, his hands slid down, gripping her waist. Then, without warning, he hauled her up and strode toward the manor.

"Put me down, Daniel Blackwood!"
###Chapter 114

The moment Daniel hoisted Evelyn onto his shoulders, reality crashed down on her.

She thrashed violently, but her struggles only fueled his dark desire.

Daniel carried her effortlessly into his private sanctuary.

Evelyn's breath caught. After six long years, she stood in his bedroom again. Every detail remained frozen in time - even the jasmine plants by the window, identical to those she'd once nurtured.

Impossible. Those original plants should have died years ago.

Had he been replacing them all this time?

The thought vanished as the door slammed shut.

Daniel pinned her against the wood, his lips claiming hers with desperate urgency.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

"Daniel!"

"Stop this!"

Her protests dissolved into the heat between them.

Later, Evelyn lay staring at the ceiling, her body still humming.

Six years of separation, and they'd nearly crossed that line again.

Fate intervened when Ethan's call came through - urgent preparations for Eleanor Blackwood's birthday gala demanded Daniel's immediate attention.

The phone call shattered the moment.

Daniel shoved her away with disgust, straightening his suit with clinical precision. His parting glare cut deeper than any blade.

"I thought you claimed not to want me?"

Evelyn lay gasping like a stranded mermaid.

She hadn't resisted. Couldn't.

Because today was her ovulation day.

For Oliver's sake, she'd endured Daniel's touch. Worse - she'd encouraged it, using every trick she remembered from their past to stoke his desire.

If not for that phone call...

She might have secured Oliver's cure and never seen Daniel Blackwood again.

A bitter laugh escaped her swollen lips.

So close.

Downstairs, Daniel scrubbed his face for the third time, the icy water failing to erase Evelyn's phantom kisses.

"Sir?" Ethan hesitated. "Shall I call a physician?"

"Unnecessary."

Daniel studied his reflection - the hollow eyes, the tension in his jaw.

Something terrifying had happened upstairs.

When he'd kissed Evelyn, every nerve screamed she was his Evelyn Carter. The way she moved, tasted, even breathed - it all felt devastatingly familiar.

Ethan's call had saved him from betraying Evelyn's memory with an imposter.

"Tell me," Daniel's voice cracked, "do you see any resemblance between this maid and Evelyn Carter?"
###Chapter 115

Daniel remained silent. His throat tightened, words failing him. "Sir, I... I've never met Mrs. Blackwood before."

Ethan watched as his boss splashed another handful of cold water onto his face, the droplets dripping down his sharp jawline. After a long pause, Daniel let out a bitter laugh. "Right. My mistake."

Ethan had only been by his side for five years.

Evelyn Carter had been gone for six.

Of course he wouldn’t recognize her.

Seeing the shadow of disappointment in Daniel’s eyes, Ethan exhaled softly. "Sir, is it because the maid Evelyn reminds you of Mrs. Blackwood? Is that why you treat her differently?"

He hesitated before continuing carefully, "If that’s the case, you shouldn’t blame yourself. It’s only natural—"

Daniel shut his eyes. He didn’t respond.

Were there similarities between the maid and Evelyn?

Yes.

Too many times, she’d given him that same fleeting sense of familiarity—her mannerisms, the way she tilted her head just slightly when lost in thought. But he knew better.

Evelyn had looked at him with stars in her eyes, warmth and devotion radiating from her every glance.

This woman’s gaze was ice. Distant. As if he were nothing more than an inconvenience.

Evelyn had loved him fiercely once. She’d left everything behind for him—her home, her family. She’d even carried his child despite the pain he’d caused her.

That kind of love didn’t vanish overnight. If she’d kept Emily, it meant part of her still held onto him. The real Evelyn would never look at him with such detached indifference.

He knew the maid wasn’t her.

And yet—

That kiss earlier had nearly unraveled him.

If Ethan hadn’t called when he did, Daniel wasn’t sure he could’ve stopped himself.

This woman was dangerous. She knew exactly how to play with his weakness.

Daniel dragged another palmful of water across his face, the chill grounding him. He snatched the towel Ethan offered and roughly dried his skin. "Let’s go. The event starts soon."

Ethan pressed his lips together, watching his boss stride away before hurrying after him. "Sir, there’s something I need to say."

Daniel didn’t slow. "Speak."

"You’re too sharp not to have realized this already. Mrs. Blackwood’s been gone six years. If she wanted to return, why hasn’t she reached out? Not a single message. Not even now, with Emily back for nearly a month."

He hesitated before adding quietly, "Her silence speaks for itself. If you... have feelings for the maid, you shouldn’t punish yourself over it."

Six years was a long time. Evelyn could have rebuilt her life—new love, new happiness.

Meanwhile, Daniel was still drowning in guilt for daring to feel something for another woman.

Daniel’s steps halted. His voice was eerily calm. "She’s angry. Angry I never looked for her."

It sounded like he was explaining to Ethan, but the words were for himself. "She wouldn’t move on. She wouldn’t stop loving me."

This was just her anger talking. The pain he’d caused her ran deep, and now she was making him suffer the same way.

All he had to do was bring her back.

Ethan sighed, recognizing the stubborn set of his boss’s shoulders. "But sir, she hasn’t shown herself all this time. What makes you so sure she’ll appear tonight?"

Daniel’s answer was absolute.

"She will."
###Chapter 116

Daniel walked away without looking back.

The celebration for Eleanor Blackwood's birthday was being held at the Starlight Grand Hotel.

The Blackwood family spared no expense—they had reserved the entire hotel. Not just the grand ballroom, but every suite as well.

The guests filling the rooms were relatives, close friends, and influential business partners of the Blackwoods.

Since this was Eleanor’s 80th birthday, the family had gone all out, inviting an unprecedented number of people.

When Evelyn arrived with Sophia, the lobby was already packed.

Sophia’s eyes widened in awe. "We have… this many family and friends?"

Evelyn gave a small shrug. "Apparently."

She had never realized just how extensive the Blackwood connections were. When she married Daniel, the family had barely acknowledged the wedding—just sending a distant representative.

Her wedding had been pitifully simple. But back then, she had been so blindly in love with Daniel that she hadn’t cared. As long as she was with him, nothing else mattered.

Now, seeing the sheer scale of this event, she realized how foolish she had been.

No wonder Daniel had chosen tonight to reveal Sophia’s true identity.

The more witnesses, the grander the statement.

Yet the wedding he had given her had been hollow. Empty.

"Evelyn."

Ethan spotted her across the room and quickly made his way over. "I’ll take Sophia from here. She’ll be entering with Mr. Blackwood later. As for you…"

His gaze held unspoken meaning. "Just relax. Enjoy the food, find a quiet corner. This is your last night—you might as well make the most of it."

Evelyn nodded. She handed Sophia to Isabelle with a final reassuring squeeze, then turned and disappeared into the crowd.

Sophia watched her mother vanish, her small heart aching. Isabelle felt it too.

"Let’s find somewhere to sit, sweetheart," she murmured, adjusting Sophia in her arms. "You’ll see her again soon. And I’ll make sure you can still talk to her—secretly."

That promise eased the tightness in Sophia’s chest.

She rested her head on Isabelle’s shoulder and closed her eyes.

If only…

If only her mother could leave this place with her father. If only they could be a real family, like other children had.

"Well, well. Look who’s here."

Evelyn had barely settled onto a secluded sofa when that sickeningly sweet voice reached her.

She didn’t need to look up to know it was Serena. She kept her gaze fixed elsewhere, refusing to acknowledge her.

"I didn’t expect to see you here tonight," Serena purred, sliding into the seat across from her.

Her makeup was even more dramatic than earlier, her dress the same, but now dripping with gaudy jewelry—all fake, of course. On her salary, she couldn’t afford the real thing.

"But I’m glad you came," Serena continued, sipping from a cocktail glass. "Otherwise, how would you witness how happy Daniel and I are?"

Evelyn’s cold stare finally flicked to her.

Serena smirked. "Haven’t you heard? Daniel’s announcing our wedding date tonight. We’re getting married."
###Chapter 117

Evelyn froze at Serena's words.

A slow smile curved her lips. "Congratulations, Ms. Hart."

"I know you don't believe me." Serena set her wine glass down with deliberate grace, her heavily lined eyes locking onto Evelyn's.

"You're just blind to the truth. Not that I blame you. How long have you worked for Daniel?"

Her smirk widened. "Do you know why Evelyn Carter, that coward, only sent her daughter back but never showed her own face?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze, fingers tracing the rim of her glass. "I wouldn't know."

"Because she didn't dare." Serena's voice dripped with satisfaction. "She knew better than anyone—her 'accident' wasn't an accident. It was planned."

"Really?" Evelyn arched a brow, meeting Serena's gaze. "And how would you know that, Ms. Hart?"

"Because Daniel orchestrated it. Of course I know."

Serena's tone remained smooth, but triumph glittered in her eyes. "He's always loved me. When he found out Evelyn was pregnant, he worried I'd be upset. So he got rid of her. I only learned later. We even fought over it."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. She forced the storm inside her to still.

"Why tell me this? We're hardly close enough for secrets."

This wasn't a confession. Serena had an agenda.

"I'm not sharing secrets with you," Serena scoffed. "You're not worth it. I just want you to know—Daniel's heart has always been mine."

She tilted her chin up, arrogance in every line of her posture. "Consider this a warning. You're the only woman who's ever come close to threatening me. But after tonight..."

A slow, cruel smile. "You'll be nothing."

She rose.

"I suggest you stay away from Daniel. Unless you want to end up like Evelyn Carter—knocked off a bridge into the sea."

Clink.

Serena lifted her glass, tapping it mockingly against Evelyn's. Then, without drinking, she tossed it into the nearest bin with a look of disgust.

A napkin appeared in her hands, dabbing elegantly at her fingers. "Enjoy your evening."

Evelyn watched her walk away, fists clenched so tight her knuckles whitened.

The pain was sharp, brutal—like a blade twisting in her chest.

She'd known. Of course she'd known. But hearing it said so casually, with that smug superiority—

It tore open old wounds.

All the softening toward Daniel these past days evaporated in an instant.

How could she forget?

She'd loved him enough to give up everything. And he'd thrown her away without hesitation.

To him, she'd never mattered.

"Evelyn."

A deep voice cut through her thoughts.

She turned.

Nathan Pierce stood behind her, immaculate in a white suit. Tall, commanding—half the room was already staring.

He held a wine glass, his smile easy. "You've been here awhile."
###Chapter 118

"Absolutely not."

Evelyn inhaled sharply, pushing down the bitterness Serena's presence stirred in her. She shifted to make space on the plush sofa, gesturing for Nathan to sit beside her.

"How long have you been here?"

"Just arrived."

Nathan's lips curved slightly as he took a sip of his champagne, scanning the glittering crowd. "Quite the event."

Evelyn nodded. "It's Eleanor Blackwood's eightieth."

Nathan stretched his legs, settling into a more relaxed position. "If I hadn't done my research on the Blackwoods, seeing this turnout would've made me think twice about challenging Daniel."

Evelyn stiffened. "You're... planning to go against Daniel?"

"That's the idea."

"There's no need, Nathan."

She exhaled, fingers tightening around her glass. "I can handle my own battles. I don't need you fighting them for me."

"It's just business." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "But if you ever need backup, I'm here."

The intimacy in his tone made her skin prickle.

After a beat, she cleared her throat. "Have you seen Liam?"

Nathan chuckled. "Outside. Two bodyguards trailing him like shadows. That kid's got your charm—got two grown men calling him 'boss' already."

Evelyn shook her head. "He has that effect. I don't."

If she did, Daniel wouldn't have discarded her so easily.

"You do." Nathan's gaze sharpened, seeing right through her. "He's just blind. If I were him, I'd never—"

"It's starting." She cut him off.

Nathan didn't protest. He simply leaned closer, their shoulders brushing as they turned toward the stage.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" The host's voice boomed. "Please welcome the guest of honor—Eleanor Blackwood!"

The crowd erupted in applause as Eleanor, regal in her emerald gown, ascended the steps with Serena's arm looped through hers.

"Thank you all for celebrating this milestone with me." Eleanor's voice was warm as she took the microphone. After a few gracious words, she clasped Serena's hand. "Tonight, I have an announcement!"

The room buzzed. Everyone knew about Daniel and Serena's long-standing engagement.

This was it.

Murmurs swelled.

"Is Mr. Blackwood finally making it official?"

"Five years—about time!"

"Match of the century!"

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms as she watched Serena preen onstage.

Their eyes met.

Serena's smirk was pure triumph.

"You guessed correctly!" Eleanor beamed, squeezing Serena's hand. "My grandson Daniel has decided to marry Serena!"

The room exploded in cheers.

Then silence.

Someone called out, "Where is Mr. Blackwood?"

The question hung heavy in the air.
###Chapter 119

The murmurs spread through the crowd like wildfire.

If this was truly a marriage announcement, where was the groom? Why was only Serena standing there with Eleanor Blackwood?

"Because Daniel isn't here."

Nathan Pierce lounged on the velvet sofa, his sharp gaze fixed on the stage. A smirk played on his lips. "Ten minutes ago, Daniel received a call. His father landed at the airport and demanded he come immediately."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her clutch. "Gregory Blackwood is coming?"

In all her years married to Daniel, she'd never once met his father.

The story went that Daniel's mother died in childbirth. Grief-stricken, Gregory drowned himself in alcohol, refusing to even look at his newborn son. To him, Daniel was the curse that took his wife's life. He'd never participated in his son's upbringing.

Daniel rarely spoke of him either.

Evelyn had learned these fragments from old family servants years ago. Gregory hadn't stepped foot in Willowbrook for decades. After finding his late wife's travel journal, he'd taken her ashes to see the world.

"Maybe it's Eleanor's eightieth birthday that brought him back."

Nathan shrugged. "But this is brilliant theater. Daniel's gone to fetch his father - that'll take at least forty minutes. These two announce the engagement in his absence. By the time he returns, it'll be a done deal. Masterful move."

Evelyn's jaw clenched. She rose abruptly.

Nathan grabbed her wrist. "What the hell are you doing?"

"Getting Sophia out of here." She'd overestimated Daniel. If he couldn't handle Serena's schemes, how could he possibly protect Sophia?

Serena's hatred for the little girl was palpable.

If Daniel couldn't shield his own daughter, Evelyn would do it herself - before he revealed Sophia's true identity to the entire Blackwood family!

"Evelyn!"

Nathan yanked her back down. "Are you insane? Daniel's men are everywhere. You'll never make it out with the girl. And when you're caught? What then? Will you tell Daniel you're actually—"

BANG!

The grand doors burst open.

Every head turned.

There, silhouetted against the afternoon light, stood Daniel Blackwood in his navy Tom Ford suit. Cradled in his arms was a small girl in a lace dress, her dark curls bouncing as he strode forward.

The man who should have been halfway to the airport.

On stage, Serena went sheet-white. She clutched Eleanor's arm. "But... Uncle Gregory called him away!"

Eleanor looked equally stunned. Their carefully laid plan had unraveled.

The night before, over Serena's jewelry appraisal, they'd arranged for Gregory to arrive just before the banquet. The call summoning Daniel away was meant to give them a clear thirty-minute window to make their announcement.

By Daniel's return, the engagement would be irreversible. He wouldn't dare cause a scene at his grandmother's birthday.

A flawless scheme - or so they'd thought.

"Surprised to see me, Grandmother?"

Daniel's voice cut through the stunned silence as he advanced toward the stage, Sophia secure in his arms.

Five hundred guests held their breath.
###Chapter 120

The little girl couldn’t have been more than five or six years old. Petite, with delicate features that mirrored Daniel Blackwood’s strikingly handsome face.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Who would’ve thought Daniel’s sharp, masculine features could look so breathtakingly beautiful on a child?

There was no doubt about it—this was his daughter.

But here was the catch. His ex-wife had supposedly died six years ago. He’d been married to Serena Hart for five.

So where… did this child come from?

Whispers spread like wildfire as Daniel carried Emily onto the stage.

His gaze flickered to Eleanor Blackwood and Serena, their expressions frozen in shock. A cold smirk curled his lips. "Grandmother, the moment you insisted I fetch my father, I knew something was off."

He just hadn’t expected Serena to be this bold—announcing their so-called marriage behind his back, banking on Eleanor’s desperation.

Serena’s face drained of color. Her lips trembled, but no words came out.

Eleanor stepped forward, shielding Serena protectively. "This was my doing. Why didn’t you go get your father yourself?"

"Him?" Daniel’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. "He’s a stranger. Why should I?"

Sending Ethan Reynolds had been more than enough courtesy. His father had given him life—nothing more.

Eleanor’s face twisted in fury. "You—"

Daniel ignored her, striding to the emcee and taking the microphone. "Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make tonight—but it’s not about a marriage."

The crowd buzzed with confusion.

"I’ve found my daughter."

His voice rang clear as he turned to the audience. "Allow me to introduce Sophia Carter—my child."

The room erupted. Daniel Blackwood had a daughter?!

Murmurs swelled until one brave soul called out, "Mr. Blackwood, who’s the mother?"

"Evelyn Carter."

No hesitation. No evasion. "My wife, Evelyn Carter. After the accident, her body was never recovered. I searched the seas for years, convinced she was still alive." His grip on Emily tightened slightly. "Turns out, I was right. Not only is she alive—she gave me this incredible little girl."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room. Evelyn Carter wasn’t dead!

The same man pressed further. "If your wife is alive, where is she? Is she here tonight?"

Daniel’s jaw tightened. "No. She… still has her reasons for staying away. But I’ll wait. However long it takes."

"And your marriage with Ms. Hart—?"

"There is no marriage."

Every word was deliberate, final. "It’s over."
###Chapter 121

His declaration sent shockwaves through the crowd.

The murmurs that had filled the room moments ago erupted into loud exclamations.

This was a scandal unfolding in real time.

Two minutes ago, Eleanor Blackwood and Serena Hart had been announcing wedding plans. Now, Daniel Blackwood stood on stage with his daughter, declaring the engagement was off.

"People change their minds so easily," Evelyn Carter scoffed, her gaze fixed on Daniel.

"I spent three years with him. He despised me enough to try ending my life. Serena's been with him for five years—maybe he's grown tired of her too."

Honestly, nothing Daniel or Serena did could surprise her anymore.

They were ruthless. Predictable.

"Now this is entertainment," Nathan Pierce drawled, stretching his arms behind Evelyn's seat. His eyes gleamed with amusement as he watched the chaos unfold.

On stage, Serena's face cycled through shades of pale and flushed. She bit her lip, voice trembling. "Daniel, you're humiliating me. I'm a public figure. You can't—"

He laughed, low and cold. "If you cared about your image, you shouldn't have schemed behind my back."

Leaning in, he whispered something that made her flinch. Then he straightened, addressing the crowd with icy authority.

"Five years ago, I became engaged to Ms. Hart. Many of you must have wondered why I'd marry my late wife's sister."

His grip tightened on the microphone. "Since I'm ending this farce today, I'll explain—so you can stop fabricating your own theories."

A hush fell.

"My wife adored Serena. Even when money was tight, she paid for Serena's elite performing arts education. The first thing she did after our wedding was buy Serena an apartment in Willowbrook."

His voice turned rough. "She made Serena my assistant despite her lack of experience. In her final letter, she begged me to marry Serena and protect her."

Daniel's gaze grew distant. "I thought it was absurd. But after her death, I saw directors preying on Serena's rising fame. So I agreed to the engagement—as a shield. We had an understanding: it was temporary. If she found real love, we'd part ways."

His jaw hardened. "I never touched her. And now that my daughter has returned—and my wife is alive—this charade ends. I've wronged no one."

A dangerous glint entered his eyes. "Spread rumors, and you'll learn exactly what the Blackwood Group is capable of."

The threat silenced the room.

Evelyn smirked from her seat.

Brilliant. In minutes, Daniel had spun a flawless narrative—painting himself and Serena as blameless. No affair. No betrayal. Just a man honoring his wife's dying wish.

A masterful lie.

But she wasn't fooled.

If they were so innocent, why had they tried to kill her?

Why had Serena been pregnant with his child while Evelyn carried his twins?
###Chapter 122

The voices carried clearly through the bedroom door.

Daniel had sent someone to sabotage Evelyn at Harborview Bridge—all because of Serena's child.

How could he commit such atrocities yet still claim innocence with Serena?

When she'd loved him years ago, she never imagined he could sink this low.

On stage, Daniel was busy explaining his relationship with Serena, completely oblivious to Evelyn sitting beside Malcolm Pierce—the heir to Pierce Corporation!

Her slender frame nestled close to Nathan on the sofa. His arm draped casually behind her.

From Daniel's vantage point, it looked like an intimate embrace.

His eyes narrowed. Since when was Evelyn acquainted with his business rival?

And their cozy proximity...

A cold smirk twisted his lips.

He'd always questioned her motives. Now he understood—she was Nathan's pawn.

Of course. That night at Silvercrest Manor when he'd been hospitalized, only Evelyn, her son, and Emily remained.

Later, the staff discovered several hours of missing surveillance footage from the study.

He'd dismissed it then, trusting the manor's security.

Now, watching Nathan's possessive posture, everything clicked.

Evelyn had been right. She'd never wanted him. Never desired him.

From the beginning, she'd been Nathan's spy.

The realization ignited an unfamiliar rage.

Was he angry about her betrayal? Or that she'd never cared for him?

Daniel thrust the microphone at the host, scooped up Emily, and stormed offstage.

"Ladies and gentlemen..." Eleanor Blackwood stood stranded on stage, forcing a smile. "My deepest apologies for this... misunderstanding."

With Daniel abandoning her mid-announcement, she had to salvage this disaster.

"At my age, memories fade." She patted her silver chignon. "The children hadn't confided their plans. When Serena mentioned an important announcement tonight, I assumed..."

Eleanor sighed dramatically. "Forgive an old woman's wishful thinking."

She grasped Serena's wrist like a vise. "This dear girl was too considerate to correct me. Even brought me a $10 million jewelry set despite their broken engagement."

Serena's smile turned rigid. The cunning hag was extorting her publicly.

That jewelry was promised only after securing Daniel. Now, with everything ruined, Eleanor still demanded payment.

"Serena darling," Eleanor cooed, nails digging into her flesh. "Show everyone your generous gift."
###Chapter 123

The spotlight burned bright on Serena as she stood center stage, her gaze sweeping over the expectant crowd. When her eyes landed on Eleanor Blackwood’s hopeful expression, she barely suppressed the urge to roll her eyes.

Thankfully, she’d only paid Nathan Pierce for a replica. If she’d actually gotten the real set, that greedy old woman would’ve bled her dry.

With a practiced smile, Serena turned to Eleanor. "Granny, of course I keep my promises. Even if Daniel calls off the engagement, we’re parting on good terms. No hard feelings."

Her gaze flicked to Sophia, still cradled in Daniel’s arms. "And even if things don’t work out between us, we’re still family. You’ve taken care of me all these years. It’s only right I give you this."

She signaled to her assistant near the stage. "Bring me the gift."

The crowd murmured in admiration as Serena accepted the velvet box. With deliberate grace, she lifted the lid, revealing the glittering contents beneath.

"This," she announced, voice dripping with pride, "is Celestial Dreams, the final masterpiece by Vincent Delacroix before his retirement. As you all know, his pieces have skyrocketed in value since he stepped away from design."

She tilted her chin higher. "I spent months tracking this set down overseas. The price? Let’s just say it wasn’t cheap."

The stage lights caught the diamonds, making them blaze like captured stars. Sapphires winked from platinum settings, the craftsmanship so exquisite the audience gasped.

"Stunning! Ms. Hart’s generosity knows no bounds!"

"Even after a broken engagement, she still honors Granny Blackwood like this? Class act."

"Rumor has it this set’s worth nearly ten million. She must truly consider Eleanor family!"

"What a shame things didn’t work out. That sister of hers could never compare."

Eleanor trembled with excitement. She’d assumed the jewelry was lost to her after the engagement fell through. Yet here was Serena—usually so stingy—handing it over like it was nothing!

Clutching the box, Eleanor gushed, "Serena, you’re too kind! At my age, to receive such a treasure—"

"But—"

A small, clear voice cut through the chatter. "But Great-Granny, that jewelry is fake."

Silence dropped like a curtain. Every head turned toward Sophia, still nestled in Daniel’s arms.

Eleanor stiffened. "Fake?"

Serena’s smile turned venomous. "I paid a fortune for this. How dare you accuse me of lying?" She shot Sophia a warning glare. "Children shouldn’t spread lies."

Sophia blinked up at her, wide-eyed. "I’m not lying. It is fake."

Daniel frowned. "How do you know that, sweetheart?"

"Because..." Sophia hesitated, then whispered, "Because the real Celestial Dreams... I designed them."

The crowd erupted. Laughter, gasps, disbelieving murmurs.

Serena scoffed. "Oh, please. You? A child who’s probably never held a pencil properly?" Her lip curled. "Didn’t your mother teach you not to lie?"

The cruelty in her tone made Daniel tighten his hold on Sophia. "Explain," he murmured, trusting his daughter implicitly.
###Chapter 124

But...

A six-year-old capable of designing such exquisite jewelry seemed impossible.

"I created these." Sophia nodded solemnly. She wriggled free from Daniel's hold and hopped off the couch.

"Auntie!" Evelyn called out, immediately rising to her feet. She approached Sophia with the little girl's bag in hand.

Daniel's gaze flickered toward Evelyn. Words hovered on his lips, but he swallowed them back.

"I brought my own jewelry design for Great-Grandma too." Sophia rummaged through her bag, her smile bright as she glanced at Eleanor Blackwood. "But since Aunt Serena already gifted you Celestial Dreams, I can't give you that one now."

She pulled out a velvet box and opened it.

Inside lay a breathtaking jewelry set.

The intricate patterns, the arrangement, even the gemstone hues—it was nearly identical to the one Eleanor held.

Yet Sophia's version shimmered with undeniable superiority.

Placing the jewelry into Evelyn's hands, Sophia then retrieved several sketches from her bag. "I brought these designs too. I'm not sure if you'd understand them, Aunt Serena. They might be too technical for you."

The words flushed Serena's cheeks before draining them pale. Her teeth clenched. "This is absurd!"

Celestial Dreams was crafted by Vincent Delacroix, a renowned designer. How could a child be Vincent?

"Seems Aunt Serena can't comprehend the sketches." Sophia sighed, turning to Daniel. "Daddy, can you find a professional jewelry designer here? Someone who'll grasp my concept instantly."

Daniel didn't hesitate. "Get one now."

"Right away."

"Allow me."

Before Ethan could move, a deep voice cut through the murmurs.

All eyes turned toward the silver-haired man stepping forward.

His resemblance to Daniel was striking, though decades older.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. "That's Gregory Blackwood—Daniel's father!"

"He was a legendary designer in his prime..."

"Stopped creating after his wife passed."

"Who expected him to appear tonight?"

Amid the whispers, Gregory knelt before Sophia. "Let Granddad see those sketches."

Sophia blinked, startled. She instinctively sought Daniel's approval.

At his subtle nod, she handed the papers over. "Granddad, do you see? When I designed this, I was thinking..."

Her voice softened as she peeked at Evelyn. "About Mommy and Daddy reuniting. I want us to be a real family. But I know it's like wishing on stars—so I named it Celestial Dreams."

Gregory studied the sketches in silence. Then, warmth flooded his weathered face. "Brilliant child."

His calloused hand gently ruffled Sophia's hair. "I know these are yours."

For years, Gregory had followed Vincent Delacroix's work. The designs always echoed pieces he'd once crafted for Daniel's mother.

He'd only attended tonight hoping to witness Celestial Dreams in person.

Now, holding Sophia's sketches, recognition flared—this was Vincent's unmistakable style.

Gathering Sophia into his arms, Gregory leveled Serena with an icy glare. "You accused my granddaughter of lying? The liar here is you."
###Chapter 125

Serena Hart froze when Gregory Blackwood exposed her in front of everyone.

Her cheeks burned with humiliation.

"Emily is your granddaughter, so of course you'd defend her!" She clenched her fists. "I refuse to believe a child could design something world-famous! And that jewelry in her hands—it can't be real!"

A desperate idea struck her.

She lifted her chin defiantly. "My set is the authentic one! I purchased it from Nathan Pierce himself! Everyone knows he was gifted the original collection before! The ones others have might be fakes, but his is genuine!"

She had struck a deal with Nathan, after all. Even if hers was counterfeit, he would publicly claim otherwise.

She could use him as her shield.

But Nathan, who had been silently observing the drama, raised an eyebrow.

He stood, smoothing his suit. "Ms. Hart, I recall you found my price too steep. I never sold you anything."

A stunned hush fell over the crowd.

Murmurs broke out.

"Is that Nathan Pierce? Here?"

"The Pierces and Blackwoods are rivals. Why would he attend Eleanor Blackwood's birthday banquet?"

"Maybe they're forming an alliance. Poor Serena—she didn’t expect him to be here."

"How embarrassing..."

Serena staggered back, her face draining of color. "That’s impossible..."

Nathan couldn’t be here.

Her nails dug into her palms. "Mr. Pierce, we had an agreement!"

Nathan smirked. "Ah, you mean our little arrangement? You paid me to announce I'd sold Celestial Dreams. But you never specified I should say it was to you." He tilted his head. "Nor did you ask me to lie for you."

Gasps erupted.

Serena couldn’t afford the real set. She’d paid Nathan to fabricate a sale—proving not only was her jewelry fake, but she’d orchestrated the deception.

There was no recovering from this.

On stage, Serena stood rigid, her face ashen.

How?

She’d planned everything perfectly.

Where had it gone wrong?

"My precious great-granddaughter!" Eleanor Blackwood rushed to Emily, pulling her into a one-armed hug while admiring the jewelry with the other.

"Why didn’t you tell me sooner?" If she’d known Emily was the designer with the real collection, she wouldn’t have tolerated Serena’s antics.

Emily squirmed slightly but murmured, "I wanted to surprise you, Great-Granny."

"And what a wonderful surprise!"

Eleanor sighed, glancing at Gregory. "She must have inherited her talent from you."
###Chapter 126

Gregory Blackwood's lips curved into a faint smile. "Perhaps."

Truth be told, natural talent only played a minor role. Sophia Carter must have poured her heart into relentless practice, coupled with expert guidance from her mentor, to create such breathtaking designs at such a young age.

While the Blackwood family reveled in their joyful reunion, Serena Hart had already discarded the counterfeit jewelry set. She was attempting to slip away unnoticed.

"Ms. Hart!"

The moment she turned, a composed yet steely female voice cut through the air. Serena froze instantly.

She recognized that voice immediately - it belonged to Evelyn Carter.

"Ms. Hart." Evelyn strode confidently toward the stage. "You can't leave just yet. We have unfinished business."

Today was the day she would end Serena's schemes permanently. If she didn't expose everything now, Sophia's earlier revelation would only fuel Serena's desire for vengeance.

Serena's brows knitted together as she shot Evelyn a venomous glare. "I have nothing to discuss with you!"

"Nothing to say to me? Then what about Ms. Sophia?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile as she ascended the stage. "You must all be wondering who I am. Allow me to introduce myself - I'm Sophia Carter's personal attendant. What an interesting coincidence. In the single month since Ms. Sophia returned to Mr. Blackwood's care, she's nearly died twice. Both times, I was there with her."

Her piercing gaze locked onto Serena. "Ms. Hart, do you happen to know anything about these incidents?"

Serena's face drained of all color. She knew exactly where this was heading. Her teeth sank into her lower lip. "I don't know what you're implying! How would I know? That little... girl must just have terrible luck!"

Gregory immediately sensed the tension. His brow furrowed as he addressed Evelyn. "Explain."

"Certainly." Evelyn nodded. "The first incident occurred a month ago. Ms. Hart claimed she wanted to take Sophia to the amusement park to bond. Yet when Sophia and I boarded the Skywheel, it malfunctioned. We were trapped at the highest point - thirty meters in the air - with a broken compartment door. Meanwhile, Ms. Hart stood below, not only refusing to call for help but actively preventing staff from assisting us."

Serena ground her teeth. "That's a complete fabrication!"

As Serena lunged toward Evelyn, Daniel Blackwood stepped forward, seizing her wrists. "Let her finish."

Serena's eyes welled with crocodile tears as she turned to Daniel. "Daniel, my dear brother-in-law! She's making up horrible lies about me! Sophia's my niece - why would I ever hurt her? You saw how distraught I was that day! I was crying my eyes out!"

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "Ms. Hart, you're quite the actress. Those tears come so easily, don't they?"

Her icy stare intensified. "You're performing right now too, aren't you?"

Serena's pallor worsened.

She clung to Daniel's arm desperately. "Daniel, you know me better than anyone! I could never be that kind of person!"

Daniel remained silent, his imposing frame blocking her path.

Finally, a cold smirk twisted his lips. "So you do remember I'm your brother-in-law?"
###Chapter 127

Evelyn suddenly looked up.

Her eyes locked with Daniel's icy stare. A shiver ran down her spine.

"Daniel, what are you implying?"

"Nothing." His voice was sharp, cutting through the tension. "Remember. I'm your brother-in-law. Emily's father."

With that, he roughly pulled his hand away from her grip. His gaze shifted coldly to Serena. "Go on."

Serena bit her lip before continuing. "After the Skywheel incident, I thought it was over. But when I took Emily home, another disaster struck. We were trapped inside when someone set the house on fire."

Her voice trembled. "If Mr. Blackwood hadn't arrived in time... Emily and I wouldn't be here celebrating Eleanor Blackwood's birthday."

Gregory's expression darkened. He turned to Daniel. "Is this true?"

Silence.

Gregory then looked at Eleanor. "Mother, did you know about this?"

Eleanor paled. "I—I knew about the fire, but—"

She hadn't known Serena was behind it. Age hadn't dulled her sense of justice.

Had she known Serena orchestrated the attack, she would never have welcomed her into their home—let alone accepted her gifts.

Gregory scoffed. "So, you all knew."

He strode to Eleanor and took Emily from her arms. "Her father. Her great-grandmother. After she nearly died in that fire, neither of you punished the culprit. Instead, you invited her to this banquet?"

His glare landed on Evelyn. "You're worse than useless."

Eleanor bristled. "I didn't know! How could I? I only knew she was Daniel's fiancée. I never imagined she'd harm Emily!"

Her voice cracked. "Daniel was investigating the fire. If he didn't say anything, how was I supposed to know?"

Gregory narrowed his eyes at Daniel. "Explain."

Meanwhile, Liam sat in the second-floor booth, sipping tea as he watched the chaos unfold.

"Time to use what I prepared."

He'd already sent Daniel all the evidence of Serena's crimes. With it, Daniel could destroy her.

Liam popped a snack into his mouth.

"But, Boss," Tyler frowned beside him. "Why isn't Mr. Blackwood revealing the proof?"

If Daniel had it, why let Evelyn talk so much?

Liam's jaw tightened. "You're wrong."

No matter what, Daniel was still Emily's father. He knew how much Daniel loved her. There was no way he'd let Serena walk free after what she'd done.

Unless...

Liam's chest burned.

Unless Daniel didn't care about Evelyn. Or Emily.

Unless he still wanted Serena.

The thought made Liam's blood boil.
###Chapter 128

"Daniel Blackwood, don't you dare let me down!"

At last, Daniel slowly raised his head. His gaze was unsettlingly calm. "I've heard the rumors. But there's no concrete evidence linking this to Serena."

Crash!

The teacup slipped from Liam's fingers, shattering on the floor. On stage, Evelyn stumbled back, shock written across her face.

This couldn't be happening. Daniel was brilliant. If Liam could uncover the truth, so could he. Unless...

Did he truly care for Serena that much?

Evelyn's mind reeled. Even Serena seemed momentarily stunned before realization dawned.

She immediately lifted her chin, shooting Evelyn a triumphant smirk. "Hear that? No proof! Keep spreading lies and I'll have you arrested!"

Watching Serena's arrogance, Evelyn felt ice form in her veins.

Daniel was protecting her. Again. Why? Even knowing she'd harmed little Emily?

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip. Her chest constricted painfully.

She met Daniel's eyes, her own burning. "Why?"

Why shield Serena now? Why deny justice to his own daughter?

Daniel's lips curled into a cruel smile as he stepped closer. His whisper was venomous. "Who are you to demand answers? A corporate spy doesn't deserve explanations."

Evelyn froze. "What spy?"

"Aren't you?" His laugh was bitter. "Coming here as a servant, then cozying up to Nathan Pierce? Was this his plan all along?"

Boom.

The accusation detonated in Evelyn's mind. So this was his truth.

All her care for Emily meant nothing. Only that single conversation with Nathan mattered.

A hollow laugh escaped her. The kind born from utter despair.

She'd been a fool. Again. Six years should have taught her better.

Six years ago, he'd chosen Serena over everything. Why would now be different?

She'd thought him heartless. Wrong. His heart belonged to Serena alone.

Drawing a shaky breath, Evelyn straightened. She marched past Daniel to the stunned emcee, snatching the microphone.

"Since Mr. Blackwood refuses to investigate who endangered his daughter," her voice rang out, steel beneath the calm, "this maid will handle it herself."

Then she turned toward the balcony. "Liam."
###Chapter 129

Shit.

Liam smacked his forehead hard. His mother Evelyn was counting on him to expose Serena's attempt to harm little Sophia.

But he'd already handed all his evidence to Daniel.

He hadn't given Daniel everything because he fully trusted him. No, this was a calculated gamble.

If Daniel used the evidence against Serena, then maybe he was still trustworthy.

If not? Well, that would be a life lesson - Daniel Blackwood couldn't be trusted.

Right now, things were spiraling dangerously out of control.

Without that evidence, Evelyn was defenseless. The private booth above remained eerily silent.

Serena's tense shoulders finally relaxed. She smirked at Evelyn with undisguised arrogance. "All bark and no bite. These are just wild accusations without proof. I could sue you for slander!"

Evelyn stood frozen, watching Serena's triumphant expression. Her nails dug painfully into her palms.

The ache in her chest was unbearable. Helpless rage burned through her veins.

Liam's absence could only mean one thing - the evidence was compromised.

With Daniel clearly taking Serena's side, and Sophia's identity now public, protecting her at Silvercrest Manor would be impossible.

If no one saw through Serena's act today... Evelyn shuddered at the thought.

She glared at Serena with barely contained fury. "Don't celebrate too soon."

"Or what?" Serena sneered. "Yes, I gave Eleanor Blackwood fake jewelry. But I'm not a murderer. I tried buying Celestial Dreams from Nathan Pierce, but his price was outrageous. What was I supposed to do? Get replicas to make Granny happy."

"My mistake doesn't make me a killer. Where's your proof? Or are you just a bitter servant who failed to seduce Mr. Blackwood?"

The crowd murmured in agreement. Several guests pointed at Evelyn. "Isn't that the woman photographed shopping with Daniel Blackwood? Looks like she's taking rejection out on poor Serena."

"Pretty face, ugly heart..."

Each word stabbed Evelyn like knives. She clenched her jaw until it ached.

Six years later, and she was still losing to Serena. History repeating itself. Because of Daniel.

"I have proof."

Just as despair threatened to consume Evelyn, a child's clear voice cut through the murmurs.

Her eyes flew open.

Oliver! He was hacking into the system remotely?

"Ms. Hart, your crimes aren't as well-hidden as you think."

The boy's voice carried Daniel's same chilling authority.

The massive screen flickered to life, displaying a foreign desktop.

"What the hell!"
###Chapter 130

Liam Carter slammed his palm on the booth's table with a loud thud. "Once again, my genius brother comes through!"

He sprang to his feet, eyes blazing with excitement. "Tyler, Dominic - move out!"

The two bodyguards paused mid-bite, sandwiches forgotten. "Sir? Where to?"

"Backstage! Guard that control room like your lives depend on it!" Liam commanded. "Nobody touches those power switches!"

Tyler and Dominic scrambled after their young boss. "On it!"

Oliver Carter's voice crackled through Liam's earpiece, amusement evident. "Glad to see you've developed a conscience."

Liam fiddled with the emerald necklace around his neck. "Hey, I own my mistakes! I was stuck until you bailed me out, bro."

"Only you would trust that snake," Oliver retorted.

Shifting focus, Oliver's fingers flew across his keyboard. The massive venue screens flickered to life under his command. He exhaled sharply and hit play.

"Exhibit A," his voice boomed through the sound system. "Ms. Serena Hart's initial transaction with amusement park personnel."

The screen split - left side showing a grainy surveillance video, right side displaying a crystal-clear payment receipt.

A woman's voice, unmistakably Serena's, hissed from the speakers: "Five million for the brat's life. Another half mil for the maid. Make it look like an accident."

The audience erupted.

So much for the "broke socialite" narrative! Serena had funds - just prioritized murder over jewelry.

Onstage, Serena's smirk vanished. She lunged for the power panel - only to collide with Dominic's massive frame.

"Leaving so soon, Ms. Hart?" Oliver's icy tone echoed through the hall. "The show's just starting."

Another recording flashed onscreen - Serena commissioning photos of Evelyn and Daniel's "affair." Then the arson plot against Sophia and Evelyn. Each revelation more damning than the last.

The pièce de résistance? Serena's breathy confession: "Mr. Prescott... I'd let you have me in a heartbeat if Daniel allowed it. That movie role would've been mine weeks ago."

The crowd's gasps came in waves. This gala had morphed into a true-crime spectacle.

Gregory Blackwood tightened his protective grip around Sophia. "Someone call the authorities," he spat, glaring at his son. "Unless you still plan to defend this monster?"

Eleanor Blackwood's face twisted in disgust. "You vile, scheming-"

A guest fumbled for their phone.

Daniel raised a single hand. "No police."

Evelyn's laugh cut through the murmurs. "Still protecting her? Even after she put a price on your daughter's head?" Her gaze turned arctic. "Send Sophia to me. At least one parent cares if she lives. As for you two? Perfect match. A murderer and her enabler."
###Chapter 131

Daniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn with chilling intensity. "Mind your manners."

He seized the microphone with deliberate control. "My apologies for this unfortunate display. The Blackwoods handle our affairs privately."

His voice carried an unspoken threat. "Tonight celebrates Eleanor Blackwood's birthday. As our honored guests, you understand discretion is expected. Should any details leave this room..."

The crowd froze under his ominous stare. Nervous glances exchanged between guests spoke volumes.

His message was clear - no police, no punishment for Serena. Just silence.

Confusion rippled through the gathering. Daniel denied any relationship with Serena, yet shielded her after she'd tried to murder his own child. What twisted bond existed between them?

Evelyn stood paralyzed. Each breath felt like swallowing shards of glass.

She lifted her chin, eyes blazing. "Mr. Blackwood! Emily is your daughter!"

"Fully aware." His dismissive tone cut deeper than any blade. Returning to the microphone, he announced, "This celebration has been marred. As compensation, my team will prepare gifts for all guests."

With a curt nod to the emcee, Daniel declared, "Continue the program. I must excuse myself."

The flustered host fumbled with the microphone. "Right... let's... uh... continue celebrating Mrs. Blackwood's 80th..."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. She'd presented irrefutable evidence, yet Daniel's protection ensured Serena walked free. His loyalty to that woman knew no bounds.

A bitter laugh caught in her throat as Daniel marched toward Serena, seizing her wrist with bruising force.

"Daniel! You're hurting me!" Serena's breathy protest carried across the room.

The familiar coquettish tone transported Evelyn back six years - to that stormy night when the same voice had called Daniel's name through a closed door. The memory still turned her blood to ice.

A traitorous tear escaped. Evelyn swiped it away angrily. Why cry for a man she'd long stopped loving?

"Evelyn." Nathan's steady presence materialized beside her. "Let's go."

With the main players departed, remaining felt pointless. She nodded mutely, allowing Nathan to guide her offstage.

From the shadows, Liam watched his mother's anguish with mounting fury. Daniel Blackwood was worse than scum.
###Chapter 132

No arguments!

"Sophia, would you like some cake?"

Sophia sat curled in Gregory’s lap. She shook her head, her eyes locked onto Evelyn’s retreating figure. "I don’t feel like eating. I’m upset..."

Miles away, Oliver observed everything through a surveillance feed. His fingers hovered over the screen where Evelyn’s image flickered before he finally closed his eyes. A heartbeat later, he traced the outline of her face on the monitor.

"Mom… I’m sorry." If not for his illness, she wouldn’t have returned to Willowbrook. She wouldn’t have faced Daniel again. She wouldn’t have been hurt by that bastard all over.

At the hotel’s rear exit.

Daniel’s grip on Serena never loosened as he hauled her through the service corridors.

"Daniel!" Serena gasped. Her wrist throbbed from his bruising hold. They had moved too fast, too violently. She was breathless, her patience fraying.

Finally, he released her. Serena sagged against the door, rubbing her wrist while glaring at him through labored breaths. Then, her lips curled into a smirk. "I knew you still had feelings for me."

"You’re delusional." His voice was glacial. With a sharp gesture, shadowed figures emerged—men in white coats who seized Serena without hesitation. They restrained her like a criminal, binding her wrists behind her back with medical tape.

Serena thrashed. "What the hell are you doing?!"

Daniel accepted a sanitizing wipe from Ethan and meticulously cleaned his hands. "You’re clearly unwell."

"I am not!"

"Of course you are." His smile was razor-thin. "No sane person would plot to murder her own sister’s children. All these years, I tolerated you because you were Evelyn’s sister. I protected you because she loved you. But you mistook my mercy for weakness."

Serena had believed her schemes flawless, her tracks covered. She was wrong. The evidence had been glaring. Daniel wasn’t a fool—he’d pieced it together swiftly.

After the Skywheel incident, suspicion took root. Evelyn’s sister should’ve welcomed Liam with open arms. Instead, Serena had tried to kill him—first on the ride, then with fire. Daniel had visited the wreckage himself, fought the arsonists, taken a blade to the gut. How could he not recognize the architect of such chaos?

Serena’s eyes bulged. "Evelyn loves me! She’ll never forgive you for this!"

Daniel ignored her screams. His gaze flicked to the doctors. "Take her away."

He’d planned to deal with Serena after canceling the wedding. But Evelyn and Liam had forced his hand.

Still, he hesitated. She was Evelyn’s blood.

He needed Evelyn back—to tell him what to do.
###Chapter 133

"Evelyn, you've had enough." Nathan Pierce sat in the dim corner of The Midnight Lounge, watching as Evelyn Carter reached for another glass of whiskey. "This isn't solving anything."

She ignored him, fingers trembling as they wrapped around the crystal tumbler.

"Damn it, Evelyn!" Nathan's hand shot out, intercepting hers with surprising gentleness. "You know alcohol only makes the pain worse."

A hollow laugh escaped her lips. "Nathan... it hurts right here." She pressed a shaky hand against her chest. "I was such a fool. I actually believed blood meant something to him. That family mattered..."

Tears streaked her mascara as she continued. "After seeing how he protected Serena, I thought... maybe there was hope. But no. His own children mean nothing to him."

"Oliver's condition is getting worse," she whispered, the words slurring slightly. "And now I can't even protect Sophia... What kind of mother am I? You should've let me die that night—"

"Stop." Nathan signaled the bartender to clear the empty glasses. His piercing gaze locked onto hers. "Storms don't last forever, Evelyn. These trials? They're forging you into someone stronger. Teaching you who's worthy of your trust."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Silent tears traced paths down her cheeks.

"Where there's life, there's hope," Nathan murmured, brushing a tear away with his thumb. "I've got my best men tracking Serena. Whether Daniel Blackwood punishes her or not, she'll answer for what she's done."

His fingers lingered near her temple, tucking a stray lock behind her ear. "Don't cry, darling. Your battles are mine now."

Upstairs on the balcony, Liam Carter sat between Tyler Walsh and Dominic Shaw. His young face contorted as he watched his mother below.

"I did this," Liam whispered into his communication device.

Across continents, Oliver watched the live feed from his wheelchair. His heart clenched seeing his twin's anguish and their mother's broken state. "No, brother. This is that bastard's doing, not ours."

"You're right." Liam's small hands clenched. "He's a monster. Always was, always will be."

Oliver's monitor beeped steadily. "To both of us."

The twins had spent years making excuses for their father. But the truth was undeniable now—Daniel Blackwood cared only for Serena Hart. His wife and children were disposable.

"How's Sophia?" Oliver asked quietly.

Liam swallowed hard. "Isabelle says she's barricaded herself in the nursery. Won't speak to anyone."
###Chapter 134

"I know Emily must be completely shattered by this..."

Emily had cheated death more times than anyone should. Though she was resilient beyond her years—having faced adversity since childhood—watching her father show leniency to the woman who nearly murdered her was too much. Unforgivable!

"It's too late tonight," Oliver murmured with a weary sigh. "I'll talk to her tomorrow when she wakes."

Liam gave a tight nod. "Alright."

He'd been the one to send Emily back to Daniel's care, hoping it would give Evelyn an excuse to reach out—and ensure she'd have an ally inside. But everything had spiraled beyond his control. Even for someone as sharp as Liam, this situation left him grasping for solutions.

His gaze dropped to Evelyn, slumped on the floor below. She was completely wasted now.

The bar had a hotel upstairs. Nathan was hauling her toward it, her dead weight straining his muscles. Yet despite her vulnerability, he remained impeccably respectful—no wandering hands, no impropriety.

Liam exhaled sharply. Sometimes, he truly admired his godfather's unwavering decency. But he couldn't fathom why Nathan still hadn't won Evelyn's heart after all this time.

Nathan deposited Evelyn onto the plush hotel bed. As he turned to fetch water, his phone buzzed. He scowled at the caller ID before answering.

"Sir," came the hushed report. "We've located Serena. Daniel's locked her away in Willowbrook Asylum."

Nathan went rigid.

"She's in the high-security wing. Extracting her without detection would be impossible."

His jaw clenched. "Understood." Hanging up, he glanced down—only to find Evelyn's bleary eyes fixed on him. She fisted his sleeve, words slurred but venomous. "Heard... Serena's name. Where is she? You promised... promised she'd pay."

"This is more complicated than we thought," Nathan admitted, smoothing her hair. "Daniel's hidden her somewhere protected. We need a new plan."

The hope in Evelyn's eyes shattered into anguish. She refused to accept this—that the woman who almost killed her child could just... walk away.

Nathan's chest ached at her devastation. "I swear to you, the moment I get my hands on her, she'll suffer. Rest now. I'll get you water."

Evelyn nodded weakly, collapsing into the pillows. Nathan strode to the kitchenette.

When he returned, the room was empty. The door gaped wide. No trace of her remained.

Nathan slammed the glass down, already dialing. "I need a search team. Now."

Daniel hadn't slept in thirty-six hours.

His study was buried under paperwork, but he abandoned it, desperate for air. The garden's chill cleared his head—until the stench of alcohol hit him.

He turned sharply.

A drunken figure swayed several feet away, eyes blazing with sober hatred. "I. Hate. You." Each word dripped venom, despite her slurred speech.

Daniel's spine stiffened. Even wasted, Evelyn's loathing was unmistakable.
###Chapter 135

The crisp night air carried whispers of autumn.

Daniel's lips twisted into a mocking smile as his cold gaze locked onto Evelyn. "What's your problem with me?"

"My problem?" A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips as she tilted her head up. "I hate how you treat me like I'm nothing. And Sophia? You don't give a damn about her either!"

Daniel pulled a cigarette from his pocket, the flame illuminating his sharp features. "Explain that last part."

Evelyn swayed slightly. "If you cared... why hasn't Serena faced any consequences?" The words stuck in her throat as the alcohol blurred her vision. She stumbled forward, collapsing against Daniel's chest. "Admit it... you never cared... not about Sophia... not about me..."

He'd planned to ignore her drunken rambling, but now found himself supporting her weight. His arms instinctively tightened around her.

"Don't... touch me..." Her slurred protest lacked conviction. "You love Serena... only Serena..."

"You never once cared! Then why keep me around? Why kiss me? Why..." Her voice broke as tears spilled over.

Moonlight revealed the raw pain in her eyes. Daniel felt something tighten in his chest.

After a beat, he gave a humorless chuckle. "Who said... I don't care?"

His quiet words cut through the night. Evelyn went still, her breathing uneven.

Instead of pushing her away, Daniel stubbed out his cigarette with unnecessary force. "Evelyn, you're playing with fire."

Six years he'd waited for his ex-wife. Now this woman - sharing his lost love's name - was shaking his resolve. Sometimes her mannerisms mirrored his ex so closely it made him question his growing attraction.

Silence answered him. Daniel frowned, turning her face toward him only to find her asleep, tear tracks glistening on her cheeks.

With a sigh, he scooped her up effortlessly and headed inside.

Normally she shared Emily's room, but tonight his daughter had locked herself in. And no way was he putting a drunk woman near his child.

He hesitated at the foot of the stairs before carrying her to his bedroom, laying her gently on the king-sized bed.

Ethan froze in the doorway. "Sir—"

"Get the kitchen to make some soup." Daniel's tone brooked no argument.

"...Yes, sir."

"Daniel Blackwood... I hate you..." Evelyn murmured in her sleep.

Shrugging off his jacket, Daniel loomed over her sleeping form. The tie around his neck suddenly felt too tight.

This hatred of hers - was it really just about Serena? Or his failure to stop her from leaving?

Downstairs, Ethan tapped his foot impatiently outside the kitchen where staff scrambled to prepare the ordered soup.
###Chapter 136

Sophia jolted awake at midnight, her throat parched. She tiptoed downstairs for water when Ethan's hushed conversation with the maid froze her in her tracks.

"The master's situation is more pressing. The lady is completely wasted."

Her tiny fingers tightened around the banister. Lady? Wasted?

She stormed forward, pigtails bouncing with each furious step. "Ethan!" Her voice cracked like a whip. "What lady? What's wrong with Daddy?"

Ethan nearly dropped his clipboard. "Miss Emily—"

"I said what lady!" She stamped her foot. "And why is she drunk?"

Defeated, Ethan rubbed his temples. "It's Evelyn. Sir Daniel carried her to his room."

The revelation hit Sophia like a bucket of ice water.

After a long pause, she finally whispered, "Then... make her hangover remedy." Her eyes suddenly gleamed with mischief. "People tell truths when they're drunk, right?"

Ethan blinked. "Who taught you that?"

"Netflix." She jutted her chin out. "Bring me wine. I'm drinking with Daddy tonight!"

She remembered Uncle Nathan once confessed his crush on Mommy after three martinis. Daddy would spill secrets too!

Her tiny fists clenched. Why had he let Serena go? Why did he hurt Mommy?

"But Miss Emily—"

"I'm the heir of Blackwood Estate!" She channeled Daddy's boardroom glare perfectly. "You take orders from me."

Ethan sighed. "The hangover tonic—"

"Don't." She chewed her lip. "Not until Daddy's drunk enough to talk."

"One hour," Ethan bargained. "Then I bring the tonic regardless."

Sophia nodded solemnly. She knew Daddy could outdrink businessmen twice his size. But she had a secret weapon—his weakness for grape juice.

"Bring the strongest bottle!" she demanded.

Upstairs, Daniel checked his Rolex for the tenth time. The knock startled him.

He flung the door open, ready to berate Ethan—only to find a pajama-clad midget struggling with a Bordeaux twice her size.

"Daddy?" Sophia peeked up through her lashes, glasses clinking in her grip. "Can we have a sleepover?"

Daniel's gaze dropped to the 1982 Lafite. "It's 2 AM, princess."

"I'm mad at you." She thrust the bottle forward. "Drink this or I'll tell Grandma Eleanor you swore at poker night."

A muscle twitched in Daniel's jaw. Then he chuckled darkly and took the bottle. "Your terms, little negotiator."
###Chapter 137

Sophia never imagined her father would consent without hesitation. She stood frozen for several heartbeats before snapping back to reality, her tiny feet carrying her into his private quarters.

Perched on the bay window's ledge, the child swung her legs absentmindedly while studying Evelyn's unconscious form sprawled across the bed. "Papa," she whispered, fingers twisting in her dress, "why is Miss Evelyn here?"

Daniel's grip tightened around his whiskey glass. "She overindulged."

"Oh." Emily's lips formed a perfect circle. "She must be heartbroken tonight."

He poured another measure of amber liquid. "You think so?"

"Obviously." Her shoes tapped against the window frame. "Miss Evelyn told me she can't stand how cruel Aunt Serena is to me. She wanted to fix everything before leaving... because she cares." The girl shot her father an accusatory glare. "But you? You just let that wicked woman walk away! No wonder Miss Evelyn's upset - she thinks you don't love me at all!"

The crystal tumbler trembled in his hand.

Could that be true?

His gaze drifted to Evelyn's sleeping form before he drained his drink in one burning swallow. "Emily, shall I explain?"

She folded her arms. "I'm listening."

Nothing could erase tonight's betrayal - how he'd abandoned her, abandoned Mama!

"I understand my decision angered you both," he began, voice like gravel, "but..." His eyes turned glacial. "I'm waiting for someone to return and handle this personally."

Emily's nose scrunched. "Who?"

"Your mother."

The child's gasp echoed through the room.

"Perhaps you're too young for this," Daniel murmured, settling beside her on the window seat. "But you've always been clever beyond your years." He took a measured sip before unveiling his scheme without reservation.

Three drinks later, comprehension dawned in Emily's wide eyes. "So... you're using Aunt Serena as bait to force Mama home?"

A ghost of a smile touched his lips as he tousled her hair. "My brilliant girl."

Emily chewed her lip, wheels turning behind her earnest expression. Suddenly, she brightened like a firework.

Tugging his sleeve, she whispered conspiratorially, "Papa... wouldn't gossip about you work better?" At his raised brow, she barreled on. "Mama's always watching from afar. She goes mad whenever women flirt with you!" The child jerked her chin toward Evelyn. "If you pretended to court Miss Evelyn... wouldn't that smoke her out?"

Daniel's laugh rumbled low. "What do children know of such things?"

"But Papa!" Emily's tiny hands fisted in determination. "How will you know unless you try? You'd even spare Aunt Serena for Mama's sake - is pretending to like Miss Evelyn so difficult?" Her pleading eyes searched his face. "Well?"

The unspoken truth hung between them - his current plan would never work. Not in a million years.
###Chapter 138

But if Daniel pursued Evelyn, everything would change. Even if Mom still refused to reveal her true identity, the two of them might finally have a real chance! With this thought, the little girl cautiously tugged at her father’s sleeve again. "Daddy, just try. I can help you!"

Daniel gave a tired smile and shook his head. "No."

"Why not?"

Sophia clenched her jaw, glaring at him with frustration. "Are you scared you’ll actually fall for Aunt Evelyn? So your love for Mom isn’t strong enough after all! Then I won’t help convince her to come back! If you don’t even believe you’ll stay loyal, why should she? You won’t even pretend with Aunt Evelyn—you must not really love Mom! You don’t actually want us to be a family again!"

Daniel fell silent.

Faced with his daughter’s stubborn logic, he didn’t know how to respond.

He exhaled sharply, pouring himself another glass and downing it in one go. "I’ll think about it."

Sophia watched him, lips pressed tight as he drained the wine, irritation bubbling inside her. "Daddy, it’ll work! Trust me! You won’t regret it!"

Her eyes shone with desperate hope, making Daniel frown. "I said I’ll think about it."

If she had suggested he pursue any other woman—someone unrelated to Evelyn—he might have agreed without hesitation. But Evelyn…

His gaze drifted to the woman asleep on his bed, the same woman who had nearly driven him out of his mind more than once. A wry smile touched his lips.

He didn’t trust himself not to fall for her.

Soon, the bottle was empty.

The wine Sophia had brought him was the strongest in the house. Even with his high tolerance, drinking it so quickly left him lightheaded. After three more glasses, his vision blurred. He rubbed his temples, fighting the throbbing ache, then slumped against the bay window. "Sophia, is that all?"

Seeing how drunk he was, she knew she wouldn’t get anything else out of him tonight.

The little girl glanced at her digital watch. "It’s late, Daddy. You should sleep."

"You too."

In his haze, he’d completely forgotten Evelyn was already passed out in his bed.

He stumbled forward, blindly reaching for the covers, then collapsed onto the mattress, pulling the "blanket" close. "Sophia, can you get to bed on your own? Daddy needs to sleep now."

"Fine."

With a dismissive shrug, she turned and marched out.

"Little princess…"

Outside the door, Ethan stood waiting, holding a cup of hangover remedy. "Sir, is he—?"

"Drunk! Who said I couldn’t do it?"

Tossing her head, Sophia strode down the hallway, hands clasped behind her back like a triumphant general.

Ethan sighed and knocked lightly. "Sir?"

No answer.

He hesitated but didn’t dare enter.

As he reached the stairs, a sudden realization struck him.

If he remembered correctly… wasn’t Evelyn still in there?
###Chapter 139

The night grew heavier.

Nathan Pierce sat rigid in his hotel suite, his knuckles white around the crystal glass. The surveillance footage on the screen showed Evelyn Carter stumbling down a dimly lit street.

He'd searched every inch of the Starlight Grand Hotel for her.

Two hours.

Then, the cameras outside caught her—unsteady, drunk, heading straight toward Silvercrest Manor.

Daniel Blackwood’s estate.

His jaw clenched.

Evelyn knew he was in Willowbrook for Eleanor Blackwood’s birthday. She didn’t know he’d come for her.

The Pierce Corporation had no business here. He’d canceled meetings, ignored calls—all to see her.

And what did she do?

Drank herself senseless for another man. Then wandered straight into his rival’s home.

His phone buzzed again. He answered with icy precision.

"Sir, your flight leaves in two hours. Should we postpone?"

"No."

He exhaled sharply. "We’re leaving."

Morning light stabbed through the curtains.

Evelyn groaned as her phone shrieked on the nightstand. She fumbled for it, barely registering the unfamiliar weight in her hand.

"Hello?" Her voice was rough with sleep.

A pause. Then a dry cough.

"Evelyn Carter?"

She rubbed her throbbing temples. "Who’s asking?"

"Gregory Blackwood. I’m downstairs. Tell Daniel to come down now."

Her eyes flew open.

Gregory Blackwood?

Downstairs?

Daniel?

She bolted upright—and froze.

This wasn’t her room.

This was Daniel’s.

Her stomach dropped as she stared at the phone. Not hers. His.

"Miss Carter, I don’t care about your lifestyle choices, but I’ve waited long enough. Get him down here."

The line went dead.

Slowly, she turned.

Daniel was already awake, watching her with those dark, unreadable eyes.

She opened her mouth. Nothing came out.

Last night—Nathan. The bar. Too much wine.

Now this.

Her gaze darted to the scattered clothes, the marks on her skin. No explanation needed.

Her head spun.

"You were drunk," Daniel said calmly, reaching for his robe. "So was I."

His tone was steady, but the tension in his shoulders betrayed him.

This changed everything.
###Chapter 140

"My father is downstairs?"

Daniel pulled the robe over his shoulders as he stepped off the bed. "I'm going to shower. Get dressed and come down. Tell the staff what you want for breakfast."

He moved with such ease, as if this wasn't the first time they'd woken up like this.

Evelyn watched his retreating back, her teeth sinking into her lower lip. "Daniel."

He paused but didn't turn.

"What else is there to say?" His voice was ice.

She swallowed hard. "We're both adults. Don't tell me—"

His lips curled into a mocking smirk. "You want me to take responsibility? You showed up drunk—is this another one of Nathan Pierce's assignments?"

Without waiting for her reply, he disappeared into the bathroom, the door clicking shut behind him.

Evelyn sat frozen on the bed, the sound of running water filling the silence. Her chest tightened, the weight of his words pressing down on her.

This was how he always treated her.

Dismissive. Cold.

At first, she'd thought it was just his nature—a man accustomed to solitude, unused to sharing his space.

But she'd learned the hard way.

It wasn't that he didn't know how to care.

He just didn't care about her.

Her fingers clenched the sheets, the ache in her chest sharp enough to steal her breath.

By the time she'd dressed, her phone buzzed with two unread messages.

One from Nathan: Leaving now—early flight. Call if you need anything.

The other from Oliver: Good morning.

Her throat tightened.

Oliver wasn't a talkative child.

Even around his siblings, he was quiet—so quiet that she'd once worried he might be struggling.

Yet here he was, calculating the time difference just to send her those two simple words.

He was worried about her.

Her fingers trembled around her phone. For Oliver, she'd do anything.

When Daniel finally emerged from the bathroom, Evelyn was waiting for him, perched on the edge of the bed.

Her smile was deliberate as she stood. "Mr. Blackwood."

His brow arched. "You're still here?"

He'd expected her to leave.

Instead, she'd changed entirely—chin lifted, gaze steady.

"I'm not going anywhere."

Daniel rolled up his sleeves, barely glancing at her. "And why is that?"

Evelyn stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Because I've decided I do want you to take responsibility."

His hands stilled.

Slowly, he lifted his gaze, the cold in his eyes cutting. "You're serious?"

"Deadly."

She closed the distance between them, rising onto her toes until her lips brushed his jaw. "You didn't push me away last night, did you?" Her fingers traced the line of his collar. "Since we both have needs... why not make this arrangement permanent?"

A beat of silence.

Then her mouth curved into a slow, dangerous smile. "What do you think, Mr. Blackwood?"
###Chapter 141

"I don't approve."

Daniel's expression darkened as he peeled Evelyn's arms from around his neck. "Your plan won't work. Had you asked before last night, I might have entertained the idea. But after what happened..."

He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "I know you're with Nathan Pierce. Did you really think I'd keep someone loyal to my rival close enough to sabotage me?"

Without another word, he turned sharply, ready to walk away.

Evelyn's fingers shot out, gripping his collar. Her gaze burned with defiance. "Are you seriously that threatened by me?"

He paused, studying her in silence.

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "I'm just a woman. You've done your research—you know exactly what I'm capable of. And yet, here you are, afraid I'll steal company secrets?" She dragged out the last word, taunting him. "Sounds like insecurity to me."

Daniel's eyes narrowed, a dark chuckle escaping him. "Nice try."

He pried her hand free, straightening his shirt with deliberate precision. "Since you're awake, get dressed and leave. Didn't you promise to disappear after the party?"

With that, he strode out, his exit as controlled as his demeanor.

Evelyn remained rooted in place, teeth sinking into her lower lip as she watched him go.

Only when his footsteps faded did she snap out of it, retreating to the bathroom to wash up before heading downstairs.

In the dining room, Sophia sat hunched over her cereal, still in her pink pajamas.

Spotting her mother, the little girl nudged the untouched bowl across the table. "Eat something."

Evelyn forced a smile, sliding into the seat opposite her. "Just woke up?"

"I've been up for ages..." Sophia mumbled around a spoonful of cereal. "I heard you and Daddy fighting. He's making you leave."

Evelyn stiffened.

After a beat, she smoothed her expression. "We weren't fighting. Just... discussing grown-up things."

Sophia's head drooped. "Last night, I made him drink until he got drunk. I thought he'd tell the truth then... but I just messed everything up."

Evelyn couldn't help but soften. "Not everyone spills secrets when they're drunk. Some people lie even better."

"Yeah..." Sophia's voice wobbled, guilt written all over her face. "If I hadn't done that, maybe he wouldn't be so desperate to kick you out."

Evelyn sighed, reaching for her daughter's small hand. "I was leaving today either way." She squeezed gently. "But nothing changes between us. We'll still see each other all the time."

Sophia nodded, eyes glistening. "Okay..."

The sight twisted Evelyn's heart. Desperate to distract her, she shifted gears. "You said you got Daniel drunk last night?"

"Uh-huh!" Sophia perked up slightly. "I went to get water, and Ethan was making a hangover drink. When I asked why, he said you were drunk. Then I remembered how godfather always says too much when he drinks, so I..."

Evelyn's smile vanished, replaced by a cold realization.

Sophia was a child. Daniel was a grown man.

If he hadn't wanted to get drunk, no one could have forced him.

He knew she'd been in his bed, intoxicated—yet he chose to drink anyway.

That told her everything.

Either he was arrogantly confident in his control... or he'd been testing his own limits with her.
###Chapter 142

One thing was certain—he wasn't as indifferent to her as he pretended.

At the very least, she still stirred his desire. That physical attraction was enough.

Besides, all she wanted from him this time was his seed.

Who he truly loved, who occupied his heart—none of that mattered to her.

With that thought, Evelyn pressed a kiss to her daughter's cheek. "I don't blame you. You actually gave me an idea."

She took a deep breath and turned to leave.

"Where are you going?"

Sophia frowned, watching her mother's retreating figure before hurrying after her on short legs.

"I'm going home now."

Evelyn paused, glancing back with a smile. "We'll see each other again soon."

Soon?

Sophia sighed, recalling her father's words from last night.

There were still things she hadn't told her mother.

Like how Daddy didn’t actually want to protect that awful Aunt Serena—he was just using it as leverage to force Mommy back.

The little girl exhaled quietly.

She knew Mommy wouldn’t believe it. She’d say it was just another excuse.

But Sophia had seen the sincerity in his eyes—just like the way her brothers looked when they meant every word.

She believed him. And in time, she was sure Mommy would too.

Just… not yet.

After leaving Silvercrest Manor, Evelyn hailed a cab straight to Grace’s place.

Since Serena had burned down the apartment Grace had arranged for her and Liam, she had no choice but to stay with her friend for now.

"Evelyn, don’t be upset."

Grace set down a plate of freshly washed fruit before settling beside her, giving her shoulder a comforting squeeze. "After the birthday party, Liam—even Oliver, all the way overseas—told me everything about your situation. Don’t lose hope. There’s always a way."

Evelyn nodded, plucking a cherry tomato with a bitter smile. "I’m sorry, Grace. For never telling you about my past."

"Why apologize?"

Grace grinned. "With a past like yours, I wouldn’t want to talk about it either. And—" She nudged Evelyn playfully. "If you’d told me earlier that you were Daniel Blackwood’s ex-wife, I would’ve thought you were lying! You know how it is—he’s always been on a pedestal. Someone like me could only ever look up."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a storm of emotions churning inside.

Grace was right.

She and Daniel had never belonged in the same world.

Back then, naive and stubborn, she’d forced her way into his life, shattered the boundaries, climbed into his bed.

And the ending?

A disaster.

"Evelyn, what’s your plan now?" Grace’s voice pulled her back.

Plan?

A faint smile curved Evelyn’s lips as she stretched out on the couch. "Sleep. For three whole days. Then we’ll see."

Grace snorted. "You make it sound like Daniel kept you awake all night at Silvercrest."

"He did."

Evelyn yawned, sinking deeper into the cushions. "One more thing—do you have a pregnancy test at home?"
###Chapter 143

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Grace. "Do you really think someone perpetually single like me would keep pregnancy tests lying around?"

Grace smirked. "Well, Daniel mentioned a certain dashing gentleman has been chasing after you lately?"

The moment those words left her lips, Grace watched as Evelyn's cheeks flamed crimson.

"We—we only just started dating! It's not like we're at that stage yet!"

Seeing her flustered reaction, Grace couldn't help but laugh, her mood instantly lifting.

She grabbed the remote and flicked on the TV, ready to tease Evelyn further—until the doorbell cut her off.

"Delivery!"

Grace blinked. "Did you order food?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It's for you."

Frowning, Grace opened the door.

The delivery man handed her a plain paper bag. Back inside, she tore it open—

Clatter.

Pregnancy tests spilled across the floor.

Grace froze.

Evelyn, however, looked smug.

"When you called saying something happened between you and Daniel last night, I knew. I might not keep them at home, but I can certainly buy them for you."

Grace groaned, picking up the receipt.

"You used your own name? What if your new boyfriend sees this and thinks—"

Evelyn waved her off, but before she could retort, Grace's phone buzzed.

Liam.

"Mom!" His voice was a conspiratorial whisper. "I snuck into the bathroom to call you. Almost got caught—my teacher almost confiscated my phone!"

Grace pinched the bridge of her nose. "Liam, if kindergarten rules say no phones, then no phones."

"But I need to check on you!" he protested. "I only agreed to go because Aunt Grace said it'd make me seem normal."

Evelyn, sitting beside Grace, winced.

She'd only wanted Liam to experience a typical childhood, not realizing how much he'd resist it.

Grace sighed. "Your aunt's right. You should have a normal life."

Liam scoffed. "Normal is boring. The other kids are babies."

Then, lowering his voice, he added, "Mom… are you okay? Emily told me you got kicked out this morning…"

Grace groaned. Emily was worse than a gossip columnist.

"She's upset. Be there for her, okay?"

"I know," he huffed. "I knew you'd say that."

"Be good for your aunt. Don’t make us worry."

Before she could finish, he hissed, "Teacher’s coming—gotta go!"

The line went dead.

Grace stared at her phone, torn between exasperation and affection.

Evelyn gaped. "That kid talks like he’s forty."

Grace sighed. "Sometimes I swear they’re the parents, and I’m the child."

Evelyn gave her a long look. "Grace… I don’t think your parenting is the issue here."
###Chapter 144

"Most kids mature through their parents' guidance. But your three? They were born wise beyond their years. At this point, no amount of parenting could make them act their age."

Evelyn had no rebuttal. Grace wasn't wrong.

Damn Daniel and his overpowering genes!

Her triplets were only six, yet they outsmarted children twice their age.

Tucking her phone away, Evelyn carefully stored the pregnancy tests in her bedside drawer. She adjusted her sleep mask and settled into bed.

Last week's drunken haze still lingered.

The throbbing in her temples told her Daniel hadn't allowed much rest.

Clasping her hands together, she whispered into the darkness, "Let this work. Please let me be pregnant..."

Her prayer dissolved into sleep. "Benjamin, you have to believe me!"

A muffled sob pierced through Evelyn's drowsiness. Grace's voice trembled from the living room. "I swear I didn't cheat on you!"

"Still lying?" A man's enraged shout followed. "Grace Thornton, we've dated one week! I haven't even held your hand, and now I find this in your apartment?"

Evelyn bolted upright.

For a moment, she thought it a nightmare.

Then another choked sob confirmed the reality.

She scrambled from bed, flinging open her door.

The living room looked ransacked.

Grace sat curled on the floor, knees to chest, face streaked with tears.

Between them lay the damning evidence - the bulk order receipt for pregnancy tests.

The scenario wrote itself. The receipt must have fallen. Benjamin saw. Assumed the worst.

Evelyn knelt beside her trembling friend. "Why didn't you wake me? I could've explained."

Grace shook her head violently. "I didn't want to drag you into my mess... I thought I could make him understand... He wouldn't even let me finish!"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Then I'll find him. Set the record straight."

This misunderstanding was her fault. She couldn't let Grace's first love crash and burn over it.

Grace gnawed her lip. "But you're single too. What if rumors start?"

"Since when do I care about gossip?" Evelyn arched a brow. "I'm a mother of three. My reputation's already in shreds."

"But you and Benjamin just started dating. This misunderstanding could ruin everything."

Grace's shoulders shook. "I don't know how to fix this."

"Leave it to me." Evelyn squeezed her hand. "Just tell me where to find him."

Grace lifted red-rimmed eyes. "He mentioned dinner plans... The Midnight Lounge. Eight tonight."

8:00 PM

The cab idled outside the upscale bar. Evelyn stepped onto the curb.

Before she could enter, a sleek Maserati purred to a stop beside her.

The door swung open, revealing tailored trousers that screamed wealth.

Evelyn didn't need to look up. She knew that car.

Turning on her heel, she marched inside without a backward glance.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor. Of all places, why did Daniel Blackwood have to appear here?

The man who despised crowded spaces. Who loathed loud music. Who wouldn't be caught dead in a bar.
###Chapter 145

"Mr. Blackwood has arrived!"
"It's Daniel Blackwood!"
"Quick, go greet him..."

The moment Evelyn stepped into The Midnight Lounge, she was met with a sea of sharply dressed men.

At the mention of Daniel's name, they surged toward the entrance like wolves catching scent of prey.

Apparently, Daniel's allure wasn't limited to women—even men couldn't resist his magnetic presence.

"Excuse me."

Midway through her irritated musings, a polished gentleman bumped into her.

He offered a curt apology before striding past to join the crowd flocking toward Daniel.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and moved further inside, pulling out her phone to study the photo Grace had sent.

Grace and Benjamin had only been dating briefly, and Evelyn hadn't met him yet.

She had to rely on the image to identify him.

The second the photo loaded, recognition flickered.

That was the man who'd just brushed past her.

Frowning, she tucked her phone away and positioned herself near the entrance, scanning the throng for Benjamin.

The doorway was packed.

A cluster of men in tailored suits surrounded Daniel, their voices low and deferential.

Though Evelyn no longer harbored feelings for him, she couldn't deny how effortlessly he commanded attention.

His height alone set him apart—towering over everyone with an air of unshakable authority.

Combined with that icy, imperious demeanor...

He was, as always, the most striking man in any room.

For a moment, Evelyn forgot why she'd come.

She watched as he responded to the men around him, his expression unreadable, his gaze dark and fathomless.

Then, abruptly, his eyes flicked in her direction.

Their stares collided.

His held nothing but frost.

A shiver raced down her spine. She quickly looked away, pretending she hadn't noticed him, and resumed her search.

Daniel's lips curled at her avoidance. He turned back to the conversation and led the group deeper into the lounge, the crowd parting like the Red Sea.

After what felt like forever, she finally spotted Benjamin trailing at the rear.

"Mr. Hayes."

She intercepted him. "I'm Grace's friend. We need to talk."

Benjamin barely glanced at her. At Grace's name, his frown deepened.

"Grace's friend? Here to plead her case?"

His tone was dismissive. "Save your breath. I pursued her because she seemed sweet and genuine. Then I found a pregnancy test at her place. Clearly, I misjudged her. We're not compatible."

He turned to leave. "I have an important dinner. I don't have time for this."

"Wait!"

Evelyn bit her lip. If he'd discard Grace over something so trivial, maybe he never truly cared.

But even if they ended things, it shouldn't be over a misunderstanding she'd caused.
###Chapter 146

"I just need five minutes."

Evelyn frowned. "I'm not here to plead her case. I'm here to clear up the misunderstanding I caused."

"You—"

Before Benjamin could respond, the crowd had already reached the elevator bank.

With a scoff, he stepped inside. Left with no choice, Evelyn followed.

Inside the elevator, she feared he might bolt.

Her fingers curled instinctively around his sleeve. "Listen," she murmured, voice low. "Let me explain—"

A mocking voice cut her off. "Benjamin, since when do you bring dates to business dinners?"

Another man chuckled. "Rumor has it you snagged yourself a fresh-faced virgin recently. This her?"

"Lucky bastard. Pretty and clingy."

Benjamin opened his mouth—then shut it.

Instead of explaining, he wrenched his arm free.

Evelyn's lips curved. She reached for his sleeve again.

He'd ignored her from the start. Why would he listen now?

This was her chance.

And if playing the desperate girlfriend sold the lie—making Grace seem all the more innocent—so be it.

She flashed the men a coy smile. "Maybe we should change the subject? He's blushing."

Their laughter confirmed it—they'd bought the act.

Evelyn leaned in, her whisper a blade against Benjamin's ear. "Hear me out later, or I'll turn you into office gossip by midnight."

He stiffened.

But he didn't shake her off.

Bold? Absolutely.

She fielded their questions with ease, though an odd chill prickled her spine.

The hallway felt heavier.

Like eyes were boring into her—casual yet deliberate.

She turned.

At the corridor's end, a man stood silhouetted against the wall.

Tall. Unapproachable.

A cigarette dangled from his fingers as he spoke to his companions.

Daniel Blackwood's gaze locked onto her hand clutching Benjamin's arm.

Her stomach dropped—like she'd been caught red-handed.

Ridiculous.

That morning, he'd made it clear he wanted nothing to do with her. Even if this were real, it wasn't his business.

She smirked at Benjamin's colleagues. "Mind if I steal him for a bit? We'll catch up later."

"Go ahead," the manager-type grinned. "Just don't keep him long. Big client meeting tonight."

"Thanks."

With that, she steered Benjamin away.

Daniel watched them vanish toward the stairwell. "Who are they?"

Harrison Whitmore shrugged. "Some small-fry company here to pitch a collaboration. Why?"

Daniel crushed his cigarette. "No reason."

But he knew one thing—Evelyn Carter was playing a game.

And he intended to learn the rules.
###Chapter 147

"What exactly are you trying to say?"

Benjamin Hayes shook off Evelyn Carter's hand the moment the stairwell door clicked shut. "Don't bother explaining. Don't lie to me! With a woman like you as a friend, Grace can't possibly be as innocent as she pretends to be!"

Evelyn barely resisted the urge to roll her eyes.

If it weren't for Grace's endless tears over this man, she would’ve punched him already.

She forced her anger down. "Mr. Hayes, I don’t know what backwater island you were raised on, but your mindset is archaic. I looped my arm through yours to force you to listen—not because I wanted to jump into bed with you. Did I kiss you? No. Did I sleep with you? No. Yet you call me 'easy'? Have you ever even spoken to a woman before?"

She crossed her arms. "And let’s be clear—if Grace wasn’t still sobbing over you at home like some lovesick fool, I wouldn’t waste my breath talking to you. A man who jumps to conclusions like this doesn’t deserve her."

At the mention of Grace’s tears, Benjamin’s expression flickered. "She’s… still crying?"

It had been seven hours since their fight.

"Obviously!" Evelyn scoffed. "If you don’t believe me, go see for yourself. Her eyes are so swollen she can barely see. If she were the kind of woman you accused her of being—someone who sleeps around and plays innocent—do you really think she’d be this devastated?"

Benjamin fell silent.

After a long pause, he finally spoke. "Then… the pregnancy tests in her apartment—"

Evelyn cut him off with a sharp laugh. "Mine. I was asleep in the guest room while you two were arguing. Grace didn’t want to wake me, thinking she could handle it herself. Stupid girl."

Benjamin’s jaw tightened.

Had he really misjudged her?

Seeing the concern in his eyes, Evelyn’s anger eased slightly. At least he wasn’t completely heartless.

But Benjamin still hesitated. "Then why were they under her sofa?"

"They fell there when I was unpacking the box." Evelyn shrugged. "I bought dozens. When I counted them, one was missing. I thought the seller scammed me—argued with him for an hour. Turns out it was just wedged under the couch."

Dozens.

Benjamin’s brows shot up.

Evelyn smirked. "Still don’t believe me? I can show you the order confirmation."

He shook his head. "That’s not necessary."

The explanation made sense. He’d been wrong.

"Is she… okay?"

Evelyn sighed. "No. She’s still crying."

Benjamin’s hands clenched.

"If this mess wasn’t my fault, I wouldn’t be here," Evelyn said flatly. "But since it is, I’ll fix it. Go to her."

He hesitated. Tonight’s dinner was crucial—his manager had made it clear that whoever secured the deal would get the promotion.

But Grace…

Evelyn read his conflict instantly.

Leaning against the railing, she smirked. "Go. I’ll handle your client. Your colleagues already think I’m your girlfriend. Any deal I close will be credited to you."

Benjamin eyed her skeptically. "You can do that?"
###Chapter 148

"Even if I can't focus, do you really think now is the time for business?"

"Room number four. Your choice—stay or leave."

Without another word, he spun on his heel and practically sprinted down the stairs.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, exhaling softly.

If she were honest… she envied what they had.

Despite Benjamin's rough edges, the way he dropped everything for Grace—sacrificing deals, abandoning meetings—spoke volumes.

And her?

The man she'd loved most in her youth had always put his career first. Whether she was burning with fever or drowning in loneliness, she never measured up—not to his ambitions, and certainly not to Serena.

She lingered in the stairwell a moment longer, gathering her scattered thoughts before squaring her shoulders and stepping back into the hallway.

The once-crowded corridor was now deserted.

One of Benjamin's colleagues spotted her, brow furrowing. "Where's Hayes?"

"Tied up."

Evelyn offered a practiced smile, falling into step beside him. "Actually, I'm his sister. Family emergency—he had to leave."

The man blinked. "What about the dinner meeting?"

Her lips curved sweetly. "I'll take his place."

He stopped short, eyeing her skeptically. "These negotiations get intense. Heavy drinking, ruthless bargaining. You sure you can handle it?"

"Not only will I handle it—I'll close the deal for your company."

His eyebrows shot up. "Confident. Fine, follow me. But if you end up drunk and regretting it, don't say I didn't warn you."

Evelyn nodded, trailing him into the private room.

Before leaving the stairwell, she'd already swallowed an anti-hangover pill.

Her tolerance wasn't legendary, but it would suffice against these men.

Inside, she calmly explained Benjamin's absence before claiming his seat.

The room was a sea of black suits—except for her. Dressed head-to-toe in crimson, sharp features radiating icy elegance, she stood out like a flame in the dark.

Maxwell Thornton, their potential client, zeroed in on her the second he entered.

"And this is…?"

The manager hurried to explain. "A colleague's sister—standing in tonight."

Maxwell's gaze raked over her, undisguised hunger in his eyes. "Impressive."

Then he gestured to the empty chair beside him. "Why sit so far? Scared of me? Come closer."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her glass.

Back overseas, she'd never attended such vulgar gatherings.

The implication in Maxwell's tone was crystal clear.

She forced a demure smile, gliding gracefully into the indicated seat. "Thank you."

One look at the old man's leer told her the deal was as good as hers.

Fifth floor, The Midnight Lounge

The formalities concluded, the atmosphere had shifted to casual revelry—cards, drinks, laughter.

Ethan slipped inside, leaning down to murmur in Daniel's ear.

A frown darkened Daniel's features. Drinking again?

With a room full of men, no less?

Did she have no sense of self-preservation, or was she deliberately courting danger?

Visions of last night flooded him—her flushed skin, the way she'd teased him, over and over.

After a tense pause, he stubbed out his cigarette with unnecessary force. "Excuse me. I have to go."
###Chapter 149

"Ms. Evelyn, you truly hold your liquor well."

In Room 404, Evelyn Carter had just downed her sixth glass of the evening.

She set the wineglass down, propped her cheek against her palm, and slowly licked the lingering drops from her lips. Her gaze, half-lidded and teasing, slid toward the heavyset man beside her. "Director Maxwell, you promised—one more glass, and you'd sign. A man of your stature wouldn't go back on his word to a woman like me, would you?"

Her voice curled like smoke, soft and deliberate.

Director Maxwell Thornton nearly forgot his own name.

How could he refuse when she looked at him like that?

"I'll sign, I'll sign!" He snatched the contract from the manager's hands. "Right this second!"

The other men in the room gaped.

They'd tried everything to close this deal.

Pretty faces, lavish gifts—nothing had worked. The last three women they'd sent his way had been sent packing with a warning from his wife.

They'd assumed Maxwell was untouchable.

Yet here was Evelyn, swaying him with nothing but a few sips of wine.

Under their stunned silence, Evelyn twirled a strand of her hair around her finger. "Manager, you remember who I represent, don't you?"

The manager blinked, then nodded furiously as he tucked the signed contract away. "Of course! Benjamin Hayes will get his promotion!"

Mission accomplished.

She smiled faintly and rose, her voice still honeyed. "I may have overindulged. My stomach isn't agreeing with me. You wouldn't deny a lady a trip to the restroom, would you?"

Maxwell's gaze raked over her, slow and assessing. "Why would I stop you?"

Evelyn laughed lightly and turned to leave—but a meaty hand clamped around her wrist.

Maxwell lounged in his chair, smirking. "Ms. Evelyn, are you really going to the restroom, or are you running now that you've gotten what you wanted? Did you think you could walk away unscathed after securing a deal worth millions?"

Evelyn's smile tightened.

"But Director Maxwell... I just need a moment."

He snorted. "Fine. Two choices. First—I accompany you."

Silence.

Disgusting.

"And the second?"

Maxwell grinned. "I'll fetch you a bucket. How's that?"

Then he glanced around the room. "It's just us men here."

Not a single one spoke up.

Cowards.

She'd just secured their fortune, and now they wouldn't even meet her eyes.

Jaw clenched, she sank back into her seat and poured him another drink. "Perhaps I can wait. A toast to you, Director Maxwell."

He smirked. "Good. After this, you'll come to a hotel with me?"

"Of course."

She smiled.

Storming out wasn't an option—not with his bodyguards lining the hallway and these spineless men offering no help.

But a hotel?

That was different.

She had plans for him there.

Maxwell threw his head back with a laugh. "A beauty like you doesn't mind an old man?"
###Chapter 150

"Absolutely not."

Evelyn flashed a coy smile. "I prefer mature gentlemen."

Just then, the door behind her creaked open.

Every head in the room swiveled toward the sound, but no one dared utter a word.

Too engrossed in their verbal sparring, Evelyn and Maxwell Thornton remained oblivious to the new arrival.

Maxwell sipped the wine she'd handed him, smirking. "Tell me, who's more attractive—me or your ex?"

Evelyn suppressed an eye roll. The man had no shame.

She forced a light laugh. "You, without question."

A mischievous glint flickered in her eyes as she devised a plan to repel him.

"Though I've had my share of flings, none were worth remembering."

The temperature in the room plummeted.

Undeterred, Evelyn pressed on. "Especially last night's disaster—pathetic and hideous—"

At the doorway, Ethan watched his boss's expression darken. When she called him "pathetic," he couldn't stay silent any longer.

"Cough! Cough! Cough!"

Ethan knew exactly what had transpired the previous night.

Wasn't she blatantly insulting Daniel as repulsive and diseased?

The woman had a death wish.

Evelyn froze mid-sentence at Ethan's interruption. Instinctively, she turned toward the noise—

And locked eyes with a gaze so venomous it could flay her alive.

Her breath hitched. When had he gotten here?

Noticing her sudden stillness, Maxwell frowned and followed her line of sight.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

He shot to his feet so violently his chair clattered to the floor.

Maxwell seemed deaf to the noise, trembling with excitement. "I heard you'd be at this lounge tonight for business! I only hoped to catch a glimpse from afar—I never imagined you'd come to me! Are you here to see me?"

He gushed like a starstruck teenager.

Daniel's lip curled in disdain. "Not worth a mention."

The room fell deathly silent.

Maxwell blinked, bewildered, before assuming Daniel was displeased with his hospitality.

He hastily pulled out the head chair. "Mr. Blackwood, why say such things? Who would dare call you insignificant?"

Daniel's icy finger pointed directly at Evelyn. "Her."

Her stomach dropped.

What fresh hell was this?

She inhaled sharply, plastering on a smile for Maxwell. "Since you have esteemed company, I won't intrude. Enjoy your evening—I'll take my leave."

Grabbing her purse, she edged toward escape.

Maxwell gave a reluctant nod. No woman, no matter how stunning, outweighed Daniel's importance in Willowbrook.

Evelyn exhaled in relief—until Daniel's iron grip clamped around her wrist.

"Leaving so soon?" His voice was a winter gale. "Finish what you started. Explain my... disease."
###Chapter 151

The words hung in the air like a bomb about to detonate.

Silence swallowed the room whole.

All eyes darted between Evelyn and Daniel, wide with shock.

His implication was crystal clear. Evelyn had just described her last lover as repulsive, filthy, and diseased—and now Daniel was asking what illness he had?

Maxwell Thornton stumbled back, face paling. "Mr. Blackwood, surely... you're joking?"

Everyone in Willowbrook knew Daniel Blackwood was a man of integrity, devoted to his late wife, Evelyn Carter.

While she lived, he avoided any gathering with women, fearing she might misunderstand. After her death, he drowned himself in alcohol until his stomach bled. For years, he even stayed engaged to Serena Hart just to protect Evelyn's sister.

At the recent birthday gala, he'd publicly declared Evelyn might still be alive—and promptly ended things with Serena to search for her.

The internet had been buzzing about his undying love.

Yet here he was, casually admitting to sleeping with this woman in front of everyone?

Was this some twisted joke?

"Do I look like I'm joking?" Daniel's lips curled as he pulled Evelyn against him. "I heard someone was harassing my woman?"

My woman.

The phrase detonated like dynamite.

The crowd looked as if they'd seen a ghost.

Whispers burned on their tongues, but no one dared speak.

Maxwell's face cycled through rage, confusion, and sheer terror.

Finally, he choked out, "Mr. Blackwood, I—I was only joking with Ms. Evelyn—"

"Save your jokes for your wife." Daniel's smile turned icy as he glanced at the man by the door. "This is your employee? Disappointing."

Harrison Whitmore stood rigid, expression stormy. "I'll handle it."

"Good."

Daniel's gaze dropped to Evelyn. "Do you want to stay and entertain Maxwell," he murmured, voice laced with warning, "or leave with me?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw.

Neither option appealed, but Daniel had just staked his claim in front of everyone. Humiliating him now would be suicide.

She'd already angered him. Pushing further? Dangerous.

Right now, she wasn't even a servant in his household. He could do whatever he pleased.

Forcing a sultry smile, she traced circles on his chest. "Of course I'll leave with you, darling."

Her icy glare flicked to Maxwell. "I'd rather die than play games with a bloated swine."

Maxwell's face purpled like rotten meat.

Seeing him seethe, powerless to retaliate, sent satisfaction coursing through her.

Smirking, she tilted her head at Daniel. "Let's go, sweetheart."

When she met his eyes, her breath hitched.

He was already watching her.

Their gazes locked.

Hers—startled, uncertain.

His—blazing.

She bit her lip, about to look away—

Then he scooped her up and strode out.

Daniel carried her from The Midnight Lounge and tossed her into his car. The impact sent her sprawling across the leather seats.

It didn't hurt, but his roughness stung.

She scrambled upright—

Only for him to cage her in, his body pressing close.
###Chapter 152

The car door thudded shut, sealing them in suffocating silence.

Evelyn's mind reeled from the impact.

She twisted violently against Daniel's grip. "Release me!"

"So I'm the sick one?" His voice turned dangerous as he pinned her down. "Shouldn't I prove you right then?"

He knew everything about that night - but what if he hadn't?

Would she have spun more lies while cozying up to other men?

The mental image made his grip tighten painfully around her wrists.

Evelyn clenched her jaw, torn between resistance and reason.

Oliver's condition required her cooperation...

With sudden resolve, she let out a breathy laugh. "Losing control, Mr. Blackwood?"

His body went rigid above her.

Seizing the moment, she wound her arms around his neck, brushing her lips against his throat. "Still refusing my proposal?" Her voice dripped with deliberate seduction.

Daniel's eyes darkened instantly.

"Out." He shoved her away and flung the door open. "Now."

The abrupt rejection stunned her.

Six years of marriage had taught her to read his tells - he'd been affected.

So why...?

"Unless you want Maxwell Thornton joining us," came his icy warning.

Evelyn paled.

Any gratitude for his earlier intervention evaporated.

Straightening her dress with sharp movements, she stormed out, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the windows.

Two steps away, fury boiled over. She whirled back, glaring at the sleek black car. Hypocrite. Then and now - nothing had changed.

The tires screeched as she marched off.

From the shadows of a concrete pillar, Harrison emerged. He slid into the passenger seat with practiced ease. "Cold shower or whiskey?"

The interior remained pitch black. Daniel's voice emerged strained. "Drive."

Harrison tossed him a water bottle. "She's gorgeous when angry. That ass in that dress? And the way she cursed you..."

Daniel twisted the cap off violently. "I'll live."

Six years without Evelyn Carter hadn't killed him yet.

"Really?" Harrison smirked. "Then explain last night."

The bottle trembled slightly in Daniel's grip. Last night...

Drunk and desperate, he'd mistaken another woman for her.
###Chapter 153

Evelyn's fury still burned hot in her chest as she exited the cab. By pure coincidence, she spotted Liam perched near the flowerbed at their complex entrance, phone pressed to his ear.

She marched toward him. "Why aren't you inside?"

The boy shrugged. "Aunt Grace and her boyfriend are being all gross and mushy. Didn't want to cramp their style."

His knowing glance cut through her. "Mom, you wanna go up there and be the awkward third wheel?"

Evelyn swallowed hard. "How long have they been...occupied?"

"About thirty minutes."

Liam kicked his dangling legs. "Think we can still crash at Aunt Grace's tonight? Saw her ugly-crying into Benjamin's shirt earlier. Grown-ups in love are so dramatic."

She rolled her eyes. "You wouldn't get it."

Grace and Benjamin had just reconciled after nearly breaking up. New couples rode emotional rollercoasters—Evelyn understood that.

Unlike her own past.

Daniel never fought with her. Not really.

Arguing with her was beneath him. On good days, he'd humor her opinions. On bad ones? She'd find herself alone in that cavernous mansion, left to "reflect on her mistakes."

"Seriously don't get adult relationships," Liam sighed dramatically. "But I'm beat. Kindergarten tomorrow with those immature brats."

He checked his tiny wristwatch. "It's almost nine! I need my full eight hours."

Evelyn massaged her temples. Her son had inherited Daniel's most irritating habits—like this obsession with "quality sleep."

She exhaled sharply. "What about...our old apartment? The burned one?"

Liam wrinkled his nose. "It's a wreck."

"Better than a hotel, no?"

The boy considered this. "True."

Hotels made his skin crawl—lingering stranger-scents, unfamiliar sheets. Even charred, their old place still felt like home.

He sprang up. "Let's move!"

The apartment lacked even basic supplies. En route, Evelyn detoured to the mall. While browsing aisles, the massive screen caught her eye:

Sources confirm Serena Hart has enrolled in an Australian film program after her broken engagement. The aspiring director refuses to let setbacks define her...

Evelyn's grip on the cart turned her knuckles bone-white.

Daniel sent Serena abroad? After everything? The near-fatal accidents she'd caused?

Of course he'd fund her fresh start. His precious Serena could do no wrong.

Meanwhile, across town, Serena pounded against padded asylum walls. "I'm not crazy! Let me OUT!"

By 10 PM, the Carter duo had restored some order to their fire-damaged home.

Liam dove into bed precisely at lights-out. "G'night, Mom!"

Evelyn abandoned her cleaning to join him. Tomorrow would come too soon.
###Chapter 154

"Finally, I get to sleep with Mommy tonight."

Liam snuggled closer, wrapping his small arms around Evelyn's. He nuzzled his head against her shoulder. "Ever since we came back, you've been with Sophia all the time. I barely get to hug you anymore."

His words tugged at Evelyn's heart. Sophia was her precious girl, but so were Liam and Oliver.

She had been so preoccupied with Oliver's condition and Sophia's safety that she hadn't realized she'd unintentionally neglected Liam—her clever, thoughtful boy.

Guilt pricked at her. She reached out, running her fingers through his soft hair. "Once Oliver gets better, I promise I'll spend every day with all of you."

Liam pouted. "You mean four of us, Mommy."

Evelyn paused, then chuckled. "Right. Four."

She still had to conceive Daniel's child to save Oliver.

"You say that now," Liam teased, grinning mischievously as he clung to her arm. "But once Oliver's healthy, he'll go right back to his computers and hacking. And Sophia? She'll be too busy designing jewelry to notice anything else."

Evelyn laughed softly. "And what about you?"

"I haven't decided yet," he said thoughtfully. Then, with a playful glint in his eyes, he added, "But if you're extra nice to me, I might help you take care of the baby."

The seriousness in his tone made her giggle.

She ruffled his hair again. "Liam, you’ve always been the one who makes me feel safe."

Even though he had once made the mistake of reuniting Sophia with Daniel, she couldn’t deny that Liam was the most dependable of her children. Unlike quiet Oliver or sometimes reckless Sophia, Liam had always shouldered responsibility far beyond his years.

She didn’t know where he got that sense of duty—certainly not from Daniel.

Daniel…

The most irresponsible man she'd ever known.

A quiet sigh escaped her as she pulled Liam closer. "Time to sleep."

That night, she slept deeply, undisturbed.

The next morning, the rich aroma of food roused her.

Evelyn blinked awake, the sound of sizzling and clinking pans drifting from the kitchen. Liam was already making breakfast.

Her stomach growled.

She scrambled out of bed, washed up quickly, and sat at the dining table like an eager child.

The actual child, Liam, carefully placed a plate in front of her. "Sleep well?"

"Like a rock." She inhaled deeply. "It's been ages since I've had your cooking."

Liam grinned. "Now that you're not running off to Silvercrest Manor, I can make breakfast for you every day."

Evelyn shook her head, amused. "Who's the adult here—you or me?"

"I'm a man," Liam declared, turning back toward the kitchen with a determined stride. "Men take care of women. Age doesn’t matter."

Her grip on the spoon faltered.

Daniel never took care of me.

Maybe it wasn’t that he couldn’t—maybe he just never wanted to.

She exhaled sharply, pushing the thought away before taking a bite.

They had barely started eating when the doorbell rang—urgent, insistent.

Evelyn frowned.

The apartment had been empty since the fire weeks ago. Who would come knocking the very first night she and Liam stayed here?
###Chapter 155

"I'll get it."

Liam Carter set down his fork with a frown, his small frame hopping off the chair before marching toward the door.

"Who's there?"

A bright, childish voice answered from the other side. "Liam, it's me! Emily! I went to Godmother's place, and she said you two didn't come home last night, so I came looking. I didn’t expect to find you and Mommy here! Open up!"

Hearing his sister, Liam perked up instantly. He swung the door wide, arms outstretched. "Emily!"

Outside stood Emily, dressed in her usual frilly princess dress, with Isabelle hovering behind her.

She eyed her brother’s open arms but breezed right past him, nose twitching. "Something smells amazing!"

The little girl marched straight into the apartment. "Are you guys eating breakfast? Did you save any for me?"

"Nope." Liam sulked as he returned to the table, plopping back into his seat.

Emily slumped dramatically at the other end of the table, chin propped in her hands. Her big, round eyes fixated on Liam’s plate, unblinking. "It looks so good..."

Liam and Evelyn exchanged exasperated glances.

A beat later, the boy sighed, grabbed an extra plate from the kitchen, and divided his food, sliding half toward his sister. "Here. Don’t say I starved you."

"Yay!" Emily snatched up her fork, beaming. "Liam, you’re the best!"

She immediately dug in, shoveling food into her mouth with gusto.

Watching her, Liam frowned. "That idiot Da— That man didn’t feed you?"

"He tried." Emily pouted. "But it was gross. Mommy wasn’t there, so I wanted Isabelle to make breakfast, but the staff said she wasn’t allowed in the kitchen."

"They insisted their food was delicious and made me try it." She wrinkled her nose. "It was awful. Granddad told Isabelle to take me out to eat whatever I wanted."

Emily swallowed another bite. "But I couldn’t think of anything I really craved."

She smirked. "So I decided to skip breakfast and visit you two instead." Her expression turned mock-offended. "And here you are, feasting without me!"

Liam chuckled. "It’s just basic stuff. Nothing fancy like what you have at home."

After all, their ingredients were just whatever they’d grabbed during last night’s rushed shopping.

Emily shrugged. "Maybe, but yours still tastes way better!" She peeked at Evelyn. "And Mommy’s cooking is a million times better than theirs!"

Evelyn smiled faintly but stayed silent.

Liam had piled her plate high. She glanced at it, then at Emily’s, and shook her head, scooping portions onto both kids’ plates.

"Mommy, you’re the best!" Emily grinned sweetly. "Way better than Daddy! He didn’t even eat with me—I couldn’t even find him! The staff said he drank too much last night, hurt his stomach, and bumped his wound. Now he’s stuck at Southridge Medical Center." She huffed. "Who knows if that’s even true."
###Chapter 156

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Mommy, it's been ages since Daddy rescued you from that fire, hasn't it? His injuries must have healed completely by now, right?"

Sophia tilted her head, studying Evelyn's reaction from the corner of her eye. "I don’t think he could’ve hurt himself badly enough to end up in the hospital again. The maids are probably just making excuses so he doesn’t have to eat breakfast with me."

Evelyn set her empty plate down with a frown. "Maybe."

She stretched lazily before sinking into the couch, scrolling through her phone as if Daniel’s hospitalization didn’t faze her in the slightest.

Sophia bit her lip, frustration tightening her small features.

Truthfully, she hadn’t come here because she missed breakfast at home. She’d hoped Mommy would panic upon hearing Daddy was hospitalized—just like she always did before.

But this time…

"Just eat," Liam muttered, shooting his sister a dismissive glance. "Stop meddling in grown-up business."

Sophia exhaled sharply before forcing another bite of toast into her mouth. She didn’t linger much longer.

Even with Daniel in the hospital, Gregory would still be waiting for her return. She couldn’t afford to waste time.

Watching Sophia leave, Liam scoffed under his breath. "Hopeless. Always falling for his charm and forgetting why we’re really here."

Evelyn chuckled. "Be fair. He’s actually been decent to her."

"Decent?" Liam gathered the dishes and carried them to the sink. The water rushed as he scrubbed, his voice icy. "If he truly cared, he’d have Serena Hart locked up instead of shipping her off to study in Australia."

Evelyn’s grip on her phone faltered.

So she wasn’t the only one who’d seen the news last night at the mall.

The thought of Daniel and Serena together sent an unexpected surge of irritation through her.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of it. Grace’s name flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn, guess who I just saw at the hospital?" Grace’s voice was hushed, laced with urgency.

Evelyn shifted, propping her feet up. "Some A-list actor?"

"Worse," Grace sighed. "Your mother! Benjamin’s manager got fired after humiliating Maxwell Thornton in front of Daniel. Thornton had him beaten up."

She lowered her voice. "Benjamin dragged me along to visit him, and that’s when I spotted her—your mom! She was wheeled into the ER on a stretcher!"

Evelyn stiffened. "You’re sure it was her?" She didn’t recall ever showing Grace photos of her mother.

"Positive!" Grace huffed. "Serena’s a public figure. She did that reality show where she brought her family along—your mom was right there on camera!"

A pause. Then, softer, "She looked… bad. Are you sure you don’t want to come?"

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

"Send me the address. I’m on my way."

The line went dead. Seconds later, a text popped up.

Southridge Medical Center.

The same hospital where Daniel was.
###Chapter 157

The call ended. Evelyn waited for Liam and Emily to finish breakfast before leaving to drop Liam off at kindergarten. Isabelle then took Emily back to Silvercrest Manor.

Standing by the curb, Evelyn watched the car carrying Emily disappear into the distance. She exhaled slowly before raising her hand to hail a cab. "Southridge Medical Center, please."

She could ignore Daniel, but she couldn't ignore Victoria.

Even if Victoria misunderstood her like everyone else, she couldn't pretend she didn’t know and skip the visit.

After all, Victoria had given her life.

Once, Victoria had been her closest confidante—closer than Serena. But…

Under Serena’s poisonous influence, she had drifted further and further from her family. Only after losing them completely did she realize how foolish she’d been.

Victoria had always been in good health. Her sudden hospitalization had to be connected to Serena. The events of that night couldn’t stay hidden forever.

With Serena abruptly shipped off to Australia, Victoria’s sharp instincts would have picked up on something.

As Serena’s mother, uncovering the truth about that banquet wouldn’t be impossible. No matter how powerful Daniel was, he couldn’t silence every tongue.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

Had Victoria fallen ill because she’d discovered Serena’s plot to hurt Emily?

The thought sent a flicker of warmth through her chest.

At least her mother still cared about her. About her children.

Then came the guilt.

When planning the birthday banquet, Evelyn had considered everything—protecting Emily, keeping Liam’s identity hidden, ensuring no one knew she’d returned for Oliver’s sake.

Yet she’d forgotten the most important person.

Her mother.

She hadn’t spared a thought for Victoria’s feelings.

Now, Evelyn faced a dilemma. She feared Victoria wouldn’t want to see her.

She bore no resemblance to the Evelyn Carter of the past. To Victoria, she was just a stranger.

A stranger who’d exposed Serena’s attempt to harm Emily, forcing Serena into exile.

Victoria would never welcome her. She’d assume this was just another twisted victory lap.

In truth, Evelyn only wanted to express concern. But who would believe that?

She sighed.

With more time, she might have crafted the perfect excuse—something logical, something that wouldn’t raise suspicion. But the cab had already pulled up to Southridge Medical Center.

Resigned, Evelyn paid the driver and stepped inside.

She didn’t expect to run into Ethan the moment she entered.

After asking the nurse for Victoria’s room number, she headed for the elevators. Just as she reached them, Ethan appeared beside her, carrying a takeout bag.

"Evelyn?"

She’d tried to blend into the background, but his sharp eyes caught her anyway.

"Here to see Sir?" He glanced at the fruit and cake in her hands. "You don’t need to bring gifts for him. He has everything."

Evelyn didn’t bother correcting him. She stepped into the elevator and pressed the button for the eighteenth floor.
###Chapter 158

Ethan Reynolds stepped into the elevator just before the doors closed.

When the elevator dinged open, he realized he hadn’t pressed the button for his floor. His hand automatically reached for the 18th-floor button—only to find it already lit.

There was only one other person who could have pressed it.

Ethan chuckled as he took the fruit basket and pastries from Evelyn Carter’s hands. “Let me carry these for you. You’re surprisingly considerate, Evelyn. I thought you didn’t know which floor Mr. Blackwood was on, but you figured it out yourself.”

Evelyn’s brows furrowed as she tried to reclaim her gifts. “These aren’t for Daniel.”

She had confirmed at the reception desk that Victoria Sinclair was staying on the 18th floor. She had no idea where Daniel was, and frankly, she didn’t care.

“You’re not here to see Mr. Blackwood?” Ethan gave her a skeptical look, convinced she was just being stubborn. “Then who are you visiting this early? Do you have other friends or family in Willowbrook besides Dr. Thornton? I thought you’ve been living abroad all this time.”

Evelyn hesitated, unsure how to respond to his rapid-fire questions.

The elevator chimed, signaling their arrival.

Before she could react, Ethan strode out, still holding her gifts, and headed straight for the private ward at the end of the hallway.

“Come on!” He turned back, waving impatiently.

She had no choice but to follow.

Ethan had taken her things, and she couldn’t exactly explain why she wasn’t here to see Daniel. As much as she despised him, she couldn’t afford to antagonize him—not before securing her pregnancy.

With a quiet sigh, she quickened her pace.

“Sir, Evelyn’s here to see you!” Ethan announced as he pushed open the door and set the gifts on the windowsill. “She’s being shy about it, though. Tried to convince me she wasn’t here for you.”

He smirked. “If she’s not here to see you, then who else would she visit at this hour? Aside from Grace Thornton, she doesn’t exactly have friends in town.”

Evelyn stiffened as she stepped inside, irritation flaring at his words.

Did everyone who spent too much time around Daniel develop this insufferable arrogance?

Since when did she have no friends in Willowbrook? And since when was she a liar?

Daniel wasn’t the only patient in this damn hospital.

“Stop lingering in the doorway,” Daniel’s cool voice cut through her thoughts. He was propped up in bed, his sharp gaze flickering over her. “Unless you want the whole floor to know you’re here.”

Evelyn pressed her lips together and stepped inside. “Mr. Blackwood, I heard you were injured.”

She forced her expression into something resembling concern. “Are you alright?”

Daniel studied her for a moment before answering. “I’m fine.”

“Good.” She offered a light, meaningless smile. “Since you’re hurt, maybe you should cut back on drinking—especially after last night.”

His eyes narrowed slightly, a cold smirk tugging at his lips. “What about last night?”

“It could lead to misunderstandings.”

Her tone was smooth, laced with just enough suggestion to be dangerous. “People might think you ended up here because you drank too much.”

Daniel’s smirk deepened. “And if they do?”

“Nothing, of course.” She met his gaze evenly, her face carefully blank. “It’s just amusing. You organized the event, yet you’re the one who got wasted and landed in the hospital.”
###Chapter 159

The tension in the hospital room dissolved like mist under morning sun.

Daniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn, who stood framed in the doorway.

Ethan recognized the private storm brewing between them. With discreet efficiency, he exited, sealing their confrontation behind the heavy door.

Alone now, the sterile air hummed with unspoken accusations. A news broadcaster's voice filled the silence, detailing Willowbrook's latest developments.

Their silent battle stretched until Daniel finally reclined against the pillows, his expression glacial. "Showing up at dawn to rehash last night? Your disappointment is palpable."

A shiver raced down Evelyn's spine.

She forced a laugh. "First, Mr. Blackwood, I didn't come for you. Ethan dragged me here. Second, yes, I'm disgusted by your cowardice last night. And third—" Her lips curled into something sharp and dangerous. "If you want a rematch, I'm game. It's not like we're strangers to this dance."

His jaw tightened.

Just then, the newscaster's polished voice cut through the room: "In recent interviews, Daniel Blackwood reiterated his hope for reconciliation with ex-wife Evelyn Carter. He expressed confidence she'll recognize his sincerity upon seeing this broadcast."

The timing couldn't be more brutal.

Evelyn's mocking smile deepened. For years, he'd carefully cultivated this image of the devoted husband. Had she not known better, she might have believed the performance.

The contradiction was nauseating—how he simultaneously chased her while pining for some phantom version of their past.

"How touching," she drawled. "Your love for your ex-wife must be oceanic in depth."

Daniel snatched the remote and hurled it at the screen. The television died with a crack.

"Get out." His voice could frost hell.

"Gladly." She strode to his bedside, collecting the untouched gifts. "These weren't for you anyway."

His glacial stare followed her exit.

Down the hall, another television droned about Serena Hart's Australian studies. Through the doorway, Evelyn watched Victoria Sinclair—her mother—absorb every word as a nurse fed her.

The familiar sting twisted deeper. Even after everything Serena had done to Sophia, Victoria still worried over her golden child.

"Visiting?" A nurse's inquiry snapped Evelyn back.

Victoria turned, surprise flickering across her face. "Evelyn?" The forced smile didn't reach her eyes. "Come in."

Setting the gifts on the nightstand, Evelyn stepped into the lion's den.
###Chapter 160

"Ms. Evelyn, I didn't expect you to visit me." Victoria smiled awkwardly in Evelyn's direction. "I know everything that happened at the birthday party."

Her expression turned solemn. "I should be thanking you. Even though my eldest daughter has been so irresponsible, refusing to return all these years, I'm grateful you've been taking care of Sophia for so long."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, offering a polite smile. "I used to be Ms. Sophia's attendant. It was my duty."

Victoria sighed, then made an excuse to dismiss the nurse from the room. Once they were alone, she gestured for Evelyn to close the door. "As a mother, I share the blame."

"I never thought Serena would do something like this to Sophia... It's my fault. I failed to raise her properly."

Her gaze locked onto Evelyn's. "But there must be some misunderstanding about Serena wanting to harm Sophia."

The words sent a chill through Evelyn's chest.

If Victoria knew about the party, she must have seen the evidence Evelyn had presented—evidence that should have explained everything.

Yet her mother's stance was clear. She didn't believe a single piece of it. She only believed Serena.

Evelyn's heart twisted bitterly.

She was Victoria's daughter too, yet her mother had never doubted for a second that Evelyn had abandoned Daniel years ago for another man.

"Ms. Evelyn." Noticing her silence, Victoria frowned, mistaking it for offense. She softened her tone. "Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying I don't believe you."

"You did this for Sophia, and I know gathering that evidence couldn't have been easy. But all of it..." She hesitated, choosing her words carefully. "I know my daughter best. If my eldest had done this to my youngest, I could understand. But my youngest isn't capable of such cruelty, so..."

Evelyn's heart turned to ice.

Victoria was saying that if she had tried to harm Serena's child, it would make sense.

Because her mother believed she was the kind of person who would do that.

And Serena wasn't.

Evelyn realized then that she shouldn't have come. Six years had changed everything.

The mother who had once loved and trusted her unconditionally now belonged only to Serena.

"Mrs. Sinclair."

Evelyn drew a sharp breath, meeting Victoria's gaze with deliberate coldness. "I understand it's hard to accept your daughter's actions. Every child is their parent's treasure. Sophia is like a daughter to me—she's my treasure."

"Your treasure hurt mine. Instead of insisting she's innocent, you should be teaching her accountability. And yet..." Her voice hardened. "Ms. Hart faced no consequences, did she?"

"She's still in Willowbrook, studying film direction. If she doesn't even have to pay for her mistakes, why are you so desperate to defend her?"

Victoria's lips parted, then pressed tight. After a long pause, she stammered, "Serena didn't leave the country... She's still here."
###Chapter 161

Evelyn's lips tightened into a thin line as she forced a weak smile. "That can't be true."

Just last night, she'd seen the news report at the supermarket with Liam. The broadcast clearly showed Serena boarding a plane, even displaying a photo of her posing proudly in front of her university in Ausland. There was no way she could still be in Willowbrook.

"It is true." Victoria exhaled shakily. Her bloodshot eyes locked onto Evelyn's. "The truth is… Daniel isn’t the noble man he pretends to be. The entire story about Serena studying abroad was fabricated. The footage of her boarding the plane, the images of her at the university—all staged."

A sob escaped her as tears spilled over. She dabbed at her cheeks with a tissue before continuing, voice trembling. "He’s keeping her prisoner. She’s locked away somewhere, guarded around the clock. There’s no escape for her."

Evelyn’s brows knitted together in disbelief. "That’s absurd."

Daniel’s unwavering devotion to Serena was something Evelyn had witnessed firsthand six years ago. Knowing him, he would have chosen exile over punishment. The idea of him imprisoning Serena sounded ludicrous.

"It’s real!" Victoria clutched Evelyn’s arm desperately. "Ms. Carter, I swear it. Serena managed to contact me—just once—before the connection was cut. She told me everything. But when I tried reaching her again… nothing."

Her fingers dug in tighter, desperation bleeding into her voice. "You must know where she is. You’re the one who accused her of harming Sophia. You presented the evidence. You have to know what Daniel’s planning!"

Her eyes burned with a mix of anguish and hope. "I’m not asking you to free her. Just… help me uncover the truth. Someone is framing her. I know my daughter. She would never do something like this!"

Evelyn’s mouth curled into a bitter smirk as she pried Victoria’s fingers away. "There is no frame-up, Mrs. Sinclair."

"What about Evelyn?" Victoria’s voice turned sharp. "What if she’s behind this? What if she manipulated Sophia into provoking Serena? It’s possible! She hasn’t returned, but what if she’s pulling strings from the shadows to eliminate Serena and reclaim Daniel?"

Evelyn shut her eyes briefly. "Mrs. Sinclair, Evelyn is also your daughter. Why are you so quick to believe she’d betray her own sister? Why do you trust Serena blindly but refuse to give Evelyn even a shred of faith?"

Victoria flinched. After a long pause, she dropped her gaze. "I can’t trust her. Not after what she did."

Her voice turned venomous. "She claimed to love Daniel—said he was the only one for her. Yet she left with another man. Faked her own death. Made us all grieve for nothing."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "She gave birth to his children, then mailed them back like packages. No mother would do that. She’s a liar. Heartless. Unforgivable."

Evelyn felt like her chest had been plunged into ice.

"Ms. Carter." Victoria pressed a slip of paper into her hand. "These are the IP addresses Serena used to contact me. The experts I hired said they’re fake, but a skilled hacker could trace the real location."

She pulled out two bank cards, her hands shaking. "I know working at Silvercrest Manor means you need money. Take this—it’s everything I have." She slid one card into Evelyn’s palm. "Just… help me find my daughter."
###Chapter 162

"I'm not from Willowbrook, and the only people I know here are you and the Blackwoods..." Evelyn attempted to argue.

Victoria didn't let her finish. She pressed another card into Evelyn's palm. "Take this one too. It's loaded with cash. Both are yours if you help prove Serena was set up."

Evelyn stared at the two cards in her hand. One was Victoria's personal account—her entire life savings. Evelyn had helped set it up years ago. The other was the card she'd given Victoria before marrying Daniel. Every penny she'd ever earned was in that account. Back then, she'd wanted to repay her parents for raising her, even as she left home so young.

Now fate had brought it full circle. Here she stood, wearing a stranger's face, while her mother offered her own money to destroy her.

"Mrs. Sinclair," Evelyn's voice was steady, "what if the evidence still points to Serena's guilt?"

Victoria stiffened. Clearly, she hadn't anticipated the question.

After a long pause, she exhaled sharply. "Then...I'll have to accept the truth." Her eyes squeezed shut. "I only have two daughters. To be betrayed by one was painful enough. If the other..." Her voice cracked.

Evelyn studied Victoria's haggard face, her bitten lip trembling. The storm inside her was unbearable. Fury that her own mother believed the worst of her. Guilt for putting that devastated look in Victoria's eyes.

"Fine. I'll help." Evelyn shoved the cards back into Victoria's hands. "Keep your money. If I prove Serena's guilty, just try to understand why your eldest daughter did what she did. Her life hasn't been easy."

She turned on her heel and walked out.

Victoria gnawed her lip, watching Evelyn's retreating form. There was something unsettlingly familiar about this woman who shared her daughter's name.

Outside the hospital, Evelyn immediately texted Oliver the IP addresses Victoria had provided.

"What's this about?" Oliver asked as his keyboard clacked in the background.

"Track these. Serena might be at the real location. Your grandmother wants me to prove her innocence."

Silence. Then: "You agreed?"

"Yes." Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "One last thing for my mother."

She'd make Victoria see the truth about her precious Serena.
###Chapter 163

Evelyn stepped through the doorway of Silvercrest Manor, exhaustion weighing on her shoulders. Before she could even sink into the couch, her phone buzzed with Oliver's call.

"Mom, I've tracked it down." His voice crackled with urgency through the receiver. "The IP address Serena used to contact Grandma Victoria? It's coming from a medical facility. Just sent you the coordinates."

Her fingers trembled as she opened the location. Willowbrook Asylum stared back from her screen, its imposing structure looming at the city's edge.

A cold realization slithered down her spine. Had Daniel lied about sending Serena abroad? The fabricated airport photos, the news reports of her departure to Verdant Heights - all elaborate theater. But why imprison her in an asylum? What game was he playing?

"Dad must've discovered Aunt Serena's crimes," Oliver mused, keyboard clattering in the background. "This is his version of punishment."

The rhythmic tapping paused. "I've accessed their patient logs. Records show Serena was admitted the same night as Eleanor Blackwood's birthday gala. Immediately after, actually."

Evelyn's breath hitched. If Daniel orchestrated this during the celebration... Her mind flashed to that evening - his impassive face, the way he'd publicly defended Serena. The contradiction burned.

This man remained an unsolvable equation.

"Doesn't matter now." Her nails bit into her palm. "She's here. We make her confess."

Oliver exhaled sharply. "What's the plan?"

"Can we visit her?"

His keyboard clattered again. "Doubt it." Surveillance footage flickered across his monitors. "Her ward's locked down tighter than Fort Knox. Those aren't hospital guards - they're Blackwood security."

A beat of silence.

"Unless..." Oliver hesitated. "You go with Daniel. That might work."

The name hung between them like a guillotine.

Oliver zoomed the camera feed, watching rotating guards. "I know why you want this, Mom. You need Serena's confession to prove everything to Grandma."

Evelyn's shoulders tensed. Her son always saw through her. Victoria's blind faith in Serena required irrefutable proof - the kind only Serena herself could provide.

Originally, Verdant Heights seemed an insurmountable obstacle. But Willowbrook? That changed everything.

"Mom." Oliver's voice softened. "If you're serious about this... you'll have to approach Daniel." The unspoken truth vibrated through the line - her hatred for Daniel ran deeper than marrow.
###Chapter 164

Oliver could still recall those nights when Evelyn would wake up sobbing. Each time, he'd rush to her side, wrapping his small arms around her trembling frame.

His mother had sacrificed everything—her identity, her safety, her peace—just to protect him, Liam, and Emily. She had endured pain and fear, reshaping herself into someone new, all for the chance to give them a fresh start. Yet because of him and Emily, she was forced back into the orbit of the very man who had shattered her world.

"Mommy." Oliver swallowed hard, his voice barely above a whisper. "I love you."

He swore to himself he'd never say another word that might hurt her.

Evelyn froze. Her quiet, reserved son had never been one for open declarations.

A soft laugh escaped her. "I know, sweetheart. You three are my whole world. There's nothing I wouldn't do to keep you safe."

She ended the call and sank onto the couch, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Daniel Blackwood. What game was he playing now?

Hours slipped by unnoticed until the clock reminded her—it was time to pick up Liam. She grabbed her keys and hurried out.

Fate had a cruel sense of timing.

There, at the school gates, stood Daniel.

The late afternoon sun painted the pavement gold, but the warmth didn’t reach his cold, imposing figure. Towering over the crowd of parents, his sharp features and icy demeanor made him impossible to miss.

Whispers rippled through the gathered parents.

"That’s Daniel Blackwood! What’s he doing here?"

"Rumor has it his ex-wife’s daughter just came back. Maybe she’s enrolled here?"

"But why this school? Shouldn’t she be at some elite academy?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw and moved to a quieter corner.

She had personally dropped Emily off at Silvercrest Manor this morning. How had the girl ended up here?

Liam. It had to be his doing. She’d have to talk to him later.

A sudden hush fell over the crowd.

Evelyn looked up—and locked eyes with Daniel. His gaze burned through her, stripping away every layer of defense.

A slow smirk curled his lips. "Fancy seeing you here, Ms. Carter."

He closed the distance between them, looming over her like a shadow.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "What a surprise, Mr. Blackwood. Here for your daughter?"

"Not a surprise. I came for you." His voice was low, deliberate.

Her brows furrowed. "For me? You threw me out of your house this morning. Now you’re stalking me at a kindergarten?"

His eyes darkened. "Hard to believe? If it weren’t for you, my daughter wouldn’t have insisted on attending school with your son."
###Chapter 165

Evelyn's breath hitched. Her suspicion was correct—Sophia had begun attending the same preschool as Liam.

"Mr. Blackwood, you're mistaken," Evelyn said coolly. "Sophia wanting to go to school with Liam is simply because they're close. It has nothing to do with me. I never suggested it."

A faint smirk curved her lips. "Here's some advice—instead of blaming others, why not actually talk to your daughter? Find out what she wants. Liam and Sophia are friends. It's natural for them to want to be together."

Daniel's eyes darkened. This woman was infuriating. First, she abruptly quit her job at Silvercrest Manor, and now she had the audacity to speak to him like this?

When he remained silent, Evelyn exhaled sharply and tried to step around him. She had no interest in continuing this conversation.

But as she moved left, Daniel blocked her path. She shifted right—he mirrored her again. Frustrated, she glared up at him. "You're in my way."

His jaw tightened. "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here. I had to send my daughter to this mediocre school because of you. So what's the problem with me standing in your way?" His tone dripped with irritation.

Evelyn gave him a look of sheer exasperation. Was this man seriously acting like a child?

With a sigh, she leaned back against the wall, while Daniel remained planted in front of her. After a tense moment, he pulled out a cigarette and lit it.

"Ms. Carter," he drawled, exhaling smoke. "You must've earned a fortune abroad. Why settle for this place for Liam? Why not something... better?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "What's wrong with this school?"

Grace had chosen it for Liam. It wasn't elite, but it wasn't bad either. The children here came from ordinary families—no pretentious social rules, no unnecessary drama. The teachers were kind, the environment nurturing. No horseback riding, no archery—just a place where kids could be kids.

That was all Evelyn wanted for Liam. He was bright. She refused to stifle him in some rigid, prestigious institution.

Sophia, though—that was unexpected. Evelyn knew the girl was spoiled, but that didn’t mean this school was beneath her. Daniel’s arrogance was showing.

His lips curled at her response. "If Liam were my son, I'd never send him here."

Evelyn’s eyes flashed. "Good thing he isn’t, then."

Something about her words unsettled him. Before he could respond, the school bell rang. Parents surged forward, crowding the gates.

Evelyn hated being jostled, and with Daniel still blocking her, she stayed put.

The children filed out one by one. Evelyn counted silently. One, two...

By the twentieth child, neither Liam nor Sophia had appeared. Her pulse quickened. Liam’s class only had twenty-five students.

Twenty-four. Still no sign of them.

Evelyn shoved past Daniel, storming toward the gate. "Where are Liam and Sophia?"
###Chapter 166

The kindergarten teacher gasped when Evelyn reacted so abruptly. She hesitated before gesturing toward the infirmary. "Emily got hurt earlier. Liam is with her now."

Before the teacher could finish, Daniel was already striding down the hall. Evelyn had no choice but to follow. Both adults burst into the nurse's office in a frenzy.

Inside, Liam sat on the examination bed, swinging his legs as he chewed on a chicken wing. "Which one do you like better? Original or spicy?"

Emily, mouth full, clutched another piece. "Both!"

"Great," Liam grinned, wiping his greasy fingers on his pants before poking her cheek. "Tomorrow, we'll say I got hurt, and you can come with me again."

"Okay!" Emily nodded eagerly, then paused. "But Mommy never lets us eat fried chicken. She says it's bad for us. This is my first time, and it's sooo good!"

Liam smirked. "Yeah, it's amazing. But Oliver says we can't eat too much." He lifted the pendant around his neck and whispered, "Right, Oliver?"

A stern voice crackled through the speaker. "Mommy's coming."

Liam's eyes widened. He jumped off the bed and shoved the chicken under the sheets. "Quick, act sick!"

BANG!

The door flew open just as Emily scrambled onto the bed.

Daniel stormed in, followed by a flustered Evelyn and the panicked school nurse. "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Carter, please—"

"Emily!" Daniel rushed to the bed. "What happened?"

"Daddy..." Emily pouted, holding up her bandaged hand. "I cut myself in class... It really hurts!"

Daniel inspected the thick wrapping, then shot a glare at the teacher. "How could you let this happen? My daughter has never been hurt before today."

The teacher wrung her hands. "It's just a tiny scratch—"

"A scratch?" he snapped. "Look at this bandage! You call that a scratch?" He turned to Evelyn, furious. "What kind of school is this? I'm taking her to Grandview Medical Center right now. If there's even a minor fracture, you're responsible, Evelyn. And this place? Shut down by tomorrow."

As he turned to leave, Emily shrieked, "Daddy, wait!" She ripped off the bandage, revealing her perfectly unharmed hand. "I'm fine! See?"

Daniel's expression darkened. "Explain."

Liam sighed, pulling the hidden chicken from under the bed. "We wanted fried chicken. So we faked an injury to trick the nurse and ordered delivery."
###Chapter 167

Daniel and Evelyn stood frozen at Liam's confession. Even the teacher behind them gaped at the sudden revelation.

Who could have predicted this outcome? Evelyn massaged her temples, thinking, What kind of little schemers did I raise? Didn’t I warn them a thousand times about junk food?

"It's all my fault, Daddy," Emily pouted. "Class was so boring, and lunch was gross. I heard another kid talking about eating fried chicken with his parents, and I wanted some too, but..."

Disappointment darkened Emily's eyes. "I knew you wouldn’t let me have it because it's unhealthy, so I asked Liam to help..."

The anger on Daniel's face faded. After a brief pause, he sighed deeply and looked at his daughter. "You little troublemaker," he murmured, his voice softening.

"This was just a misunderstanding, Mr. Blackwood," the teacher said nervously. "You... you're not going to shut down our school over this, are you?"

This kindergarten had never enrolled a student as prominent as the daughter of the infamous Daniel Blackwood. The staff had been terrified of any mishap, which was why they’d panicked when Emily got hurt and immediately catered to her every whim. That was how the two kids had managed to distract the nurse and teachers long enough to sneak in an order for fried chicken.

"He won’t," Evelyn answered when Daniel remained silent. She exhaled in relief and smiled at the teacher and nurse. "Thank you for your help. Everything’s fine now. You can go."

The teacher and nurse exchanged uneasy glances but figured Evelyn’s word was trustworthy since she’d arrived with Daniel. They nodded and hurried out.

Once they were gone, Evelyn turned to Liam with a stern glare. "Liam, what were you thinking?"

"Emily wanted fried chicken..." Liam mumbled, lowering his head. "I wanted some too..."

"You can have it," Daniel’s deep voice cut in. His gaze flicked past Evelyn and settled on Liam. "The reason we don’t let you eat junk food is because it’s unhealthy. But if you really want fried chicken, I’ll have the chef prepare some for you."

"Yay!" Emily’s face brightened instantly. "Daddy, I want... I want Liam and Auntie to come home with us and have fried chicken too. Can they?"

Daniel’s lips curled into a smirk as he shot Evelyn a cold look. "Of course." He extended a hand toward Liam. "Come on."

He made no move to acknowledge Evelyn.

Liam scowled at the offered hand and lifted his chin defiantly. He still hadn’t forgiven Daniel for losing the evidence of Serena’s attempt to harm Emily. Ignoring Daniel, he grabbed Evelyn’s hand instead.

"We’re only going for Emily!" he declared.

Evelyn hesitated. She hadn’t decided whether to accept Daniel’s invitation, but then she remembered what Oliver had told her earlier. The only way to confront Serena in person was through Daniel.

With a resigned sigh, she tightened her grip on Liam’s hand. She had no choice but to go along with it.
###Chapter 168

The kindergarten gates swung open as Daniel, Evelyn, Liam, and Emily emerged into the now-empty courtyard. The usual crowd of waiting parents had long since dispersed.

Ethan, who'd been patiently standing by the car, nearly choked on his own breath at the sight.

Daniel and Evelyn—together again?

Just last night, they'd parted ways in icy silence. And this morning, Daniel had stormed back to the hospital room looking like a thundercloud. Yet here they were, mere hours later, walking out side by side like nothing had happened.

Daniel effortlessly scooped Emily into his arms and slid into the backseat.

Liam, clearly avoiding him, yanked open the front passenger door and climbed in without a word.

Evelyn hesitated. Then, with a quiet exhale, she opened the opposite door and settled into the backseat. Daniel on the left. Evelyn on the right. Emily wedged snugly between them.

"Daddy, you're the best!" Emily beamed up at him, her tiny fingers clutching his sleeve. "I wouldn't have lied if I knew you'd say yes to fried chicken!"

Daniel arched a brow, his large hand engulfing hers. "Next time, just ask. No more lies."

Emily ducked her head, cheeks pink. "Okay..."

"Especially if you're hurt. Got it?"

Her nose scrunched. "But what if I do get hurt?"

Daniel's gaze dropped to her small fingers, nails painted cherry red. "Then Daddy will be very upset." A pause. "And whoever hurt you will regret it." His voice was velvet-soft, but the edge beneath was unmistakable.

Emily grinned, then shot Evelyn a smug look. "See, Aunty? Told you my daddy's the best."

Evelyn's lips thinned. She said nothing.

Best father? Please.

If Daniel truly cared about Emily—if he really punished those who hurt her—then where was the justice for Serena?

From the moment Emily was born, Serena had been the one person hell-bent on destroying her. Yet this man, playing the doting father, had done nothing but lock her away.

The thought made Evelyn's chest tighten. She stole a glance at Daniel, studying his profile. What was his plan for Serena?

The car rolled to a stop at Silvercrest Manor.

"Sir! Princess!" Isabelle rushed forward, all smiles, as the engine cut off. "How was school?"

The door opened. Evelyn stepped out.

Isabelle's smile faltered. "Ms. Evelyn? What are you—"

"Daddy's treating Liam and Aunty to fried chicken!" Emily chirped, hopping down from the car. "Izzy, can you make some?"

Isabelle scooped her up. "Of course!"

Then, hesitating, she glanced between Daniel and Evelyn. "Sir, are you... sure about having guests over for fried chicken?"

Daniel straightened his cuffs as he stepped out. "Why wouldn't I be?"

Isabelle inhaled sharply. "Your father's here. He's been waiting in the parlor for an hour." A nervous flick of her eyes toward Evelyn. "He said... he needs to discuss Ms. Evelyn with you."
###Chapter 169

Evelyn was stunned by Isabelle's words. Why would Gregory Blackwood want to discuss her with Daniel? She was just a former maid who had resigned from the Blackwood household. What could there possibly be to talk about?

Daniel looked equally surprised. His sharp gaze flickered to Evelyn with disapproval before turning back to Isabelle. "Tell the chefs to prepare fried chicken," he instructed.

Isabelle hesitated for a brief moment before nodding. She took the hands of the two children, and the three of them disappeared into the house. Ethan, meanwhile, left to park the car in the garage.

Now, only Daniel and Evelyn remained outside Silvercrest Manor. Daniel didn’t seem in any hurry. He pulled a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and leaned lazily against one of the pillars. The smoke curled around his face, making his already cold expression even more unreadable.

His steel-gray eyes locked onto Evelyn, and his lips curled into a mocking smirk. "So, when you couldn’t get anything out of me, you decided to target my father instead? What did Nathan Pierce promise you to make you his puppet?"

Evelyn’s brows furrowed at first, but then she let out a quiet, humorless laugh. Daniel actually believed she had orchestrated this—that she had lured Gregory here under the pretense of discussing her. Worse, he thought she had been trying to extract confidential information for Nathan all along.

How arrogant.

Nathan might be Daniel’s biggest competitor, but he wasn’t the kind of man who would resort to such underhanded tactics. The fact that Daniel’s mind immediately went there only proved how little he thought of others—and how much lower his own standards were.

A cold glint flashed in Evelyn’s eyes as she met his gaze. "You’re so convinced I’m Nathan’s spy? Fine. Then answer me this, Mr. Blackwood—if I really were working for him, wouldn’t Pierce Corporation already have all of Blackwood Group’s secrets by now?"

Daniel exhaled a slow stream of smoke. "Just because they don’t have them now doesn’t mean they won’t. Maybe Nathan’s just waiting for the right moment." His piercing stare never wavered, even as the smoke partially obscured his face.

"I don’t care who sent you or what you want," he said, his voice dangerously low. "I warned you, Evelyn. You can come at me all you want, but my family is off-limits. You used Emily and my father as pawns to get close to me. It won’t happen again." He crushed the cigarette under his shoe. "Let’s go inside."

Without waiting for her, Daniel strode into the manor, his tall frame disappearing through the doors.

Evelyn stood frozen for a heartbeat, her fists clenched at her sides. No matter how much she despised him, she knew what she had to do. She had to endure.

And she was very, very good at enduring.

By the time she stepped inside, Gregory had already risen from the couch. "Daniel," he began, "I need to talk to you about that girl—Evelyn—"

His words cut off abruptly when he noticed her standing there. After an awkward pause, he offered a strained smile. "Ah, Ms. Carter. You’re here as well."

Evelyn returned the smile politely. "Hello, Mr. Blackwood."
###Chapter 170

"Isabelle told me you've been waiting here for more than an hour?" Daniel removed his tailored jacket and passed it to a nearby maid. He settled onto the plush sofa, resting his arm casually on the leather armrest. "You wanted to speak with me?"

"I did," Gregory replied. His gaze flickered toward Evelyn, softening briefly. "But it can wait. We'll talk another time."

"Next time, I might not be interested in hearing what you have to say," Daniel countered, crossing one long leg over the other. "Speak now."

Their relationship had always been strained, more like distant acquaintances than father and son. The coldness in Daniel's tone made it clear he regarded Gregory with no more warmth than he would a subordinate.

Gregory hadn't anticipated such blatant disregard. The lack of respect stung, but he forced a dry smile. "Fine. I'll get straight to the point."

He cleared his throat, glancing at Evelyn again. "It's about Ms. Carter. As you know, I'm a jewelry designer, and Emily has shown remarkable talent in the field. But I'll be leaving Willowbrook soon to handle some matters, and I don't want her potential to go untapped. Frankly, I didn't think anyone in this city was qualified to mentor her—except..."

His finger pointed directly at Evelyn. "Except for Ms. Carter." He exhaled sharply. "At first, like everyone else, I assumed she was just another maid. But when I discovered her true identity and skill, I was stunned. And ashamed I hadn't recognized her sooner."

His eyes locked onto Evelyn with unsettling intensity. "Ms. Carter's genius in jewelry design is exactly what Emily needs. She would be the perfect teacher for her."

A low chuckle escaped Daniel. He arched a brow, his gaze sweeping over Evelyn's face with icy skepticism. "You expect me to believe you're not involved in this scheme?"

Since Gregory's return to the Blackwood family, their conversations had been scarce. Now, just days before his departure, he suddenly proposed Evelyn as Emily's mentor? The timing was too convenient. Daniel's suspicion flared—Gregory was clearly part of Evelyn's plan to stay close to him.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the edge of her skirt. Something was off.

She had once been a renowned jewelry designer, but before returning to Willowbrook, she'd ensured Nathan altered her records. Her fabricated resume painted her as an amateur with modest achievements—hardly qualified to teach a prodigy like Emily. There were countless designers in the city with more impressive credentials.

Gregory's claim was an outright lie.

Her lips pressed into a thin line as she shot him a questioning look. What game was he playing?

"Daddy!" Emily's voice cut through the tension as she bounded into the room. "Can you come upstairs? Liam and I need to talk to you!"

Daniel murmured an acknowledgment and rose from the sofa. "Excuse me. This won't take long."

"Go ahead," Gregory said with a dismissive wave. "I'd like a word with Ms. Carter anyway."

Daniel's frown deepened. He cast one last cold glance at Evelyn before striding up the stairs.

The moment he disappeared, the air in the living room thickened.

Gregory exhaled and settled into the chair opposite Evelyn. "Ms. Carter," he began, pouring himself a cup of tea. "Or should I say... Moon?"

He took a slow sip, his eyes never leaving hers. "The legendary Moon, who recently announced her permanent retirement from jewelry design. Who would have guessed I'd find her working as a maid in my son's home?"
###Chapter 171

Warning signals flashed through Evelyn's mind. "I don't understand what you mean," she countered swiftly.

Gregory's lips curved knowingly. "Oh, you do." He reclined effortlessly against the sofa cushions. "Ms. Carter, let's not forget—I was a jewelry designer myself before Eleanor passed. And this industry? I still have plenty of connections."

His fingers tapped the armrest. "I've studied your background. You went to great lengths to hide your identity. Surely you wouldn't want me revealing it here?"

Evelyn's pulse steadied as the initial shock faded. She met his gaze squarely. "How did you find out?"

Gregory chuckled. "Don't worry—this wasn't some targeted investigation. When I discovered Sophia was actually the renowned designer Vincent Delacroix's protégé, I researched her mentor extensively. Moon was her teacher, wasn't she?" He leaned forward. "A few calls to European contacts confirmed my suspicions about you."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her teacup. So he knew about Moon—but not the full truth. He simply believed she was a dedicated mentor unwilling to abandon a prodigy.

"You're right about Sophia's talent," Evelyn admitted, setting down her cup. "She's extraordinary. But I've already resigned from Silvercrest Manor. My teaching days there are over."

Gregory exhaled sharply. "At six years old, her potential is limitless. She needs proper guidance." His gaze intensified. "Which is why I'm offering you a position at Blackwood Jewelry. Design by day, mentor Sophia evenings."

Evelyn's breath caught. Working at Daniel's company aligned perfectly with her plans—though this route was unexpected. "Mr. Blackwood, Daniel would never allow it."

After today's confrontation, she could still feel Daniel's hostility radiating across the dinner table. He'd blame her for Sophia's sudden school demands and this very proposal.

"Leave Daniel to me." Gregory stood, smoothing his jacket. "The question is—do you accept?"

Evelyn hesitated only a heartbeat. "I do."

"Excellent." Gregory's shoulders relaxed. "Wait here—I'll speak with him now."

Alone in the cavernous living room, Evelyn massaged her temples. The grandfather clock's ticking grew oppressive. Needing movement, she drifted toward the kitchen's muted lighting.
###Chapter 172

The kitchen was bustling with activity as Evelyn and Isabelle worked side by side, preparing fried chicken for the children.

Isabelle glanced up with a smile when Evelyn entered. "Ms. Carter, I don’t understand why kids love fried chicken so much. It’s so greasy and unhealthy."

Evelyn frowned, eyeing the golden-brown pieces. She had to admit, Isabelle was right—it looked heavy and oily.

Then she remembered the leftover ingredients from the last time she’d made mushroom soup. Without hesitation, she tied on an apron and started gathering what she needed.

"Ms. Carter," Isabelle began, lowering her voice. "Actually, about Mr. Pierce—"

"Shh." Evelyn cut her off sharply. "You’re new here at Silvercrest Manor. If anyone finds out you have ties to Nathan, they’ll assume you’re spying for him."

Isabelle paled, her hands freezing mid-motion.

"You… don’t want to talk about him?" she asked hesitantly.

Isabelle had once worked for the Pierce family and had seen firsthand how devoted Nathan was to Evelyn. Even when Evelyn was abroad, they’d remained close. But since her return to Willowbrook, she’d distanced herself.

The way Nathan would stare at his phone, waiting for a call that never came—it made Isabelle’s heart ache.

"It’s not that I don’t want to," Evelyn murmured, keeping her voice low. "This just isn’t the place."

She swiftly changed the subject. "How much chicken did you make? We shouldn’t overdo it—too much isn’t good for them."

Isabelle turned away, her shoulders stiff. "Noted."

Silence settled between them as they worked. Evelyn moved to pass by Isabelle when—

Sizzle.

A drop of scalding oil leapt from the pan and landed on the back of Evelyn’s hand.

"Ah!" She jerked back, hissing in pain. A small blister was already forming.

"Ms. Carter!" Isabelle rushed to turn off the stove, grabbing Evelyn’s wrist and pulling her to the sink. Cold water rushed over the burn as Isabelle apologized frantically. "I—I’m so sorry! How could I be so careless?"

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. "Let this be the first and last time."

Isabelle froze. "What do you mean?"

"You’re upset because I wouldn’t discuss Nathan with you. Fine. But if you ever take that frustration out on me again, there won’t be a second chance."

Isabelle’s face drained of color. "I—I didn’t—"

"Don’t play innocent." Evelyn’s voice turned icy. "We both know our way around a kitchen. That wasn’t an accident."

Isabelle’s hands trembled. After a beat, she lifted her chin. "Mr. Pierce has given up so much for you. He loves you."

"And that justifies hurting me?" Evelyn scoffed, twisting the faucet shut. "Do you really think Nathan would thank you for this?"
###Chapter 173

"Absolutely divine fried chicken!"

The golden-brown chicken arrived ten minutes later, sending Sophia into delighted little jumps. Liam mirrored her excitement but hesitated, casting a wary look at Evelyn. "Mommy..."

"Go ahead, sweetheart," Evelyn smiled, already settled at the dining table.

"Please enjoy this wild mushroom soup, everyone," Isabelle announced proudly as she placed steaming bowls before each guest. "Ms. Evelyn thought the fried chicken might be too rich, so she prepared this soup specially!"

Gregory sampled a spoonful and nodded. "Quite excellent."

Daniel remained silent. His sharp gaze caught Evelyn subtly keeping her right hand hidden beneath the table. "What happened to your hand?"

Evelyn met his stare impassively. "Nothing. Just not very hungry."

"Not hungry," Daniel's obsidian eyes pierced through her facade, "or injured? Show me."

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Reluctantly, she lifted her bandaged hand into view.

Sophia gasped, her chicken leg clattering onto the plate. "Aunty Evelyn! What happened?"

Liam vaulted from his chair to her side, clutching her wrist with trembling fingers. "Does it hurt?"

Their concern warmed Evelyn's chest. She shook her head. "Just a small burn from cooking oil. Nothing serious."

"Small burn?" Daniel's voice turned glacial as he pinned Isabelle with a look. "Two experienced cooks making such an amateur mistake?"

Isabelle shrank under his scrutiny, shoulders hunching.

A humorless smirk twisted Daniel's lips. "Explain. Now."

The command made Isabelle flinch. "I...I..."

"It was my carelessness," Evelyn interjected calmly, cradling her soup bowl with her uninjured hand. "I'd gotten my hand wet while preparing the soup. When I tried helping Isabelle, water dripped into the pan. The oil splashed." She gave Isabelle a reassuring glance. "She blames herself unnecessarily. Don't scold her."

Isabelle's head snapped up, eyes wide with confusion.

Gregory accepted the explanation. "Do be more careful, Ms. Evelyn. As our guest at Silvercrest Manor, you needn't involve yourself in kitchen duties."

"Of course," Evelyn agreed pleasantly.

Daniel made no further comment, though his lingering glare at Isabelle spoke volumes. The meal resumed with Evelyn struggling to eat left-handed until Liam finished and scooted beside her.

"Mommy fed me when I was little," he declared, spearing a tender piece of chicken. "Now it's my turn."

Evelyn's laughter sparkled. "How does it feel, reversing our roles?"

Liam grinned. "Pretty awesome."

"Me too! I want—" Sophia's eager offer died as she remembered her designated role as merely "Aunty" Evelyn. Swallowing hard, she turned hopeful eyes to Daniel. "Daddy, can I feed you?"
###Chapter 174

Daniel's expression darkened instantly. "We'll discuss this later."

Sophia's shoulders slumped. "Okay..."

Gregory couldn't bear seeing his granddaughter so dejected. "Come here, Emily! You can feed me instead!"

The little girl's face brightened immediately. She grabbed her bowl and scrambled onto Gregory's lap. "Open wide, Grandpa!"

The elderly man chuckled and obediently parted his lips.

Meanwhile, Evelyn finished her meal. Liam joined his sister in feeding their grandfather. Gregory wanted to protest but couldn't resist Emily's pleading eyes. He sighed and let the children have their way.

Evelyn moved to the living room sofa and pulled out her phone. The cushion beside her dipped suddenly as Daniel's tall frame settled next to her.

"Your hand," he commanded in that deep, gravelly voice.

Her right arm extended automatically before she could think.

Electricity shot up her spine when their skin made contact. She tried to pull back, but his grip tightened.

"Stay still." Daniel held her wrist firmly while retrieving the first aid kit. He peeled back the bandage to reveal an angry red burn. The blister had ruptured, leaving raw flesh exposed.

His jaw tightened as he applied cooling ointment. The medication soothed the stinging instantly.

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured after a long pause.

"Why didn't you punish her?" Daniel kept his eyes on her injury. "Instead you took the blame."

Evelyn blinked. "You knew about Isabelle?"

"Obviously." A humorless laugh escaped him. "You've worked at Silvercrest Manor long enough to never make such mistakes."

She shrugged. "She wasn't being malicious."

"That's your excuse?" His voice turned sharp. "How do you know she wasn't pretending? You'd rather suffer than make her face consequences?" His thumb brushed over her wound. "Foolish woman."

The words struck deeper than the burn. Evelyn met his piercing gaze. "Mr. Blackwood, may I ask you something?"

She inhaled sharply. "Did it hurt when Emily got injured?"

Daniel's fingers stilled. "Of course."

"Then..." Her lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Why did you let the person who nearly killed her go unpunished?" She tilted her head. "If I'm foolish, what does that make you, Mr. Blackwood?"

His stunned reflection stared back from her clear eyes.
###Chapter 175

Daniel Blackwood met Evelyn Carter's gaze without speaking.

After a long pause, he finally looked at her, his voice flat. "I have my reasons."

"Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I understand you might be lenient with Ms. Hart because of your history with her. You've known her for years—it makes sense you'd hesitate to punish her. But she committed a crime. She should face the consequences. If you can't bring yourself to act, hand the evidence over to the authorities. Let them handle it."

Her eyes never left his as she fought to keep her anger in check. "Attempted murder isn't a capital offense. She'd serve a few years, that's all. By the time she's released, Emily would be older. Strong enough to protect herself. She wouldn't be in danger anymore."

Evelyn frowned. "So why won't you do it?"

Daniel's expression darkened with every word. His movements grew rougher as he applied the ointment to her burn. The pain made her wince, but she didn't stop. "Why show Serena mercy when she doesn't deserve it? Is she really more important to you than your own daughter?"

Clang!

He dropped her hand and threw the ointment back into the first aid kit. The metal container clattered loudly against the edge.

"Seems like you're not in pain anymore," he snapped, standing abruptly.

Half of her wound remained untreated, the raw skin exposed. Isabelle, who had been watching from a distance, stepped forward hesitantly, ready to finish what Daniel had started.

"Don't bother." His cold glare stopped her. "Put the kit away."

Isabelle glanced at Evelyn, conflicted. Evelyn shook her head, picked up the bandage, and began wrapping the burn herself.

Daniel's jaw tightened at her indifference. "Butler," he called sharply. "Escort Ms. Carter and Liam out." Without another word, he strode upstairs.

Evelyn watched him go, a smirk tugging at her lips. She'd hit a nerve.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have reacted like this—throwing a tantrum and kicking his guests out early.

She turned to Emily.

The little girl had been happily eating her fried chicken, but now she sat frozen, wide-eyed, as if she didn't know what to make of the sudden tension.

Gregory Blackwood frowned. "Ms. Carter, I—"

The butler hurried over. "Ms. Carter, my apologies, but—"

"Don't worry about it." She smiled and motioned to Liam. "Come on, sweetheart. Time to go."

Liam nodded, grabbed his jacket, and ran to her side. He took her left hand. "Let's go, Mom!"

"Mr. Blackwood doesn't seem to be in the mood for visitors," Evelyn said to Gregory. "I don't think now's the best time to discuss my employment at Blackwood Group." She didn't wait for a response before leading Liam out.

Gregory sighed and turned to Emily. "Finish your food, sweetheart. I'll go check on your father." He followed Daniel upstairs.

Outside Silvercrest Manor...

Liam tugged Evelyn toward the sidewalk but didn't stop to hail a cab. Instead, he pulled her into a nearby pharmacy.

"Wait here," he told her firmly before stepping inside. "Do you have burn cream?"
###Chapter 176

Evelyn Carter stood frozen outside the pharmacy, her breath fogging up the glass door as she watched Liam inside. A bitter chuckle escaped her lips. How could her three precious angels—Oliver, Liam, and Sophia—possibly share DNA with Daniel Blackwood? That man didn't deserve such remarkable children.

"Mommy?" Liam's voice snapped her from her thoughts. He emerged holding a tube of burn cream, his small fingers already tugging at her sleeve. "Let's go home. I'll take care of your wound properly this time." His jaw tightened. "Don't waste another thought on that bastard. We don't need him to get what we want."

Evelyn squeezed his hand until her knuckles turned white. "I know, sweetheart."

With her children by her side, no obstacle seemed insurmountable.

Exhaustion hit her like a tidal wave the moment they returned home. After a hasty application of the ointment, Evelyn collapsed onto her bed, sinking into oblivion before her head fully hit the pillow.

Moonlight streamed through the curtains.

Liam waited until her breathing deepened before slipping out of bed. Phone flashlight in hand, he carefully unwrapped the bandage on Evelyn's arm.

His small hands trembled as he reapplied the cream. His mother had been distracted lately—he couldn't trust she'd done it right. The angry red burn made his stomach churn. This wouldn't heal properly without proper care.

As he worked, dark promises formed in his young mind. Daniel Blackwood would pay for every tear his mother had shed.

"Daniel..." Evelyn's sleep-slurred whisper made Liam freeze mid-motion. "Why did you... choose her over me?"

The anguish in her voice sent a knife through Liam's chest. What kind of spell had Serena Hart cast to make Daniel abandon someone like Evelyn?

"I'm so sorry, Mommy," he whispered, securing the fresh bandage with meticulous care.

If not for him and his siblings, maybe Evelyn could have moved on. Instead, they were living reminders of her shattered love—constant echoes of Daniel's betrayal.

On the balcony, cold moonlight highlighted Liam's grim expression as he dialed Oliver. "I need to investigate Serena."

Silence stretched before Oliver's cautious reply. "Mommy told us to leave the past alone."

Liam's grip turned the phone case white. "She had no one to fight for her back then. But she has us now." His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "They need to face what they've done."

"Revenge isn't—"

"This isn't about revenge." Liam exhaled sharply. "I just want them to look Mommy in the eye and admit they destroyed her."
###Chapter 177

Evelyn Carter woke to an empty house.

Liam had already left for preschool, but not before making her breakfast. A handwritten note sat beside the plate.

Mommy, I'm at school now. Eat your food and don't get your bandage wet. P.S. I left this for you.

Beneath the note lay a pregnancy test.

Evelyn sank onto the edge of the bed, staring at the food and the test. Her throat tightened. Even at his age, Liam was more thoughtful than most adults.

After a long pause, she grabbed the test and walked to the bathroom.

One line. Negative.

A bitter laugh escaped her. Of course. Nothing in her life came easily.

She tossed the test into the trash and washed up.

Halfway through breakfast, the doorbell rang.

Assuming it was Grace, Evelyn answered with toast still in her mouth.

"Ms. Carter!"

The booming male voice made her jump.

A man in a tailored black suit stood there, smiling. "Good morning! Theodore Kingsley, head of HR at Blackwood Jewelry. Mr. Blackwood personally requested I inform you—you've been accepted into our design internship program."

Evelyn's eye twitched. "Internship?"

"Indeed." Theodore's smile never wavered. "Rest assured, your compensation will match that of a full-time designer."

"Mr. Blackwood was impressed by your potential. He believes you'll make waves in this industry."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. Daniel was playing games.

Her forged resume omitted her true identity as Celestial, but it still listed years of experience. She didn't need an internship—this was a calculated insult.

Clever. By offering this instead of a real position, Daniel could claim he'd honored his father's request while humiliating her. If she refused, he'd look justified.

"Ms. Carter?" Theodore prompted when she stayed silent.

Evelyn shoved the rest of the toast into her mouth. "Give me two minutes."

She vanished inside before he could respond.

Theodore blinked. Daniel had prepared scripts for every possible rejection. Acceptance wasn't part of the plan.

Fumbling for his phone, he texted Ethan Reynolds: She said yes. Now what?

The reply came instantly: Bring her in.

"Ready." Evelyn reappeared in a white blouse and light blue cardigan, pastel yellow backpack slung over one shoulder. Bright. Cheerful. Nothing like someone who'd just been insulted.

Theodore stared. This wasn't going how anyone expected.
###Chapter 178

Evelyn's outfit screamed "fresh design intern" from head to toe.

Daniel froze mid-step, blinking rapidly as if his eyes were playing tricks on him. The woman descending the stairs bore no resemblance to the one who had answered the door moments ago.

"Today's my first day, right?" Evelyn breezed past his stunned silence, her tone casual as she adjusted her bag strap. "Mind briefing me on the work schedule? I'll need to leave early—my son's school pickup waits for no one."

Theodore nearly tripped over his own feet. "You have a son?" His gaze flickered over her youthful face, disbelief tightening his throat. She couldn't be older than twenty-two.

A soft laugh escaped her. "Obviously. He and Mr. Blackwood's daughter are practically inseparable."

Ah. The puzzle pieces clicked. That's how this woman from a modest apartment complex had Daniel Blackwood's personal number. A child's friendship had bridged worlds.

The car ride to Blackwood Enterprises was a one-sided lecture. Theodore droned on about company policies while Evelyn watched the city blur past her window.

"Evelyn!" His patience frayed. "These aren't standard corporate rules. Break them, and kiss your paycheck goodbye."

Her lips curved. "I'm listening."

Every word was seared into her memory. A decade ago, she'd drafted these very policies with Daniel—especially the maternity benefits. She could still feel the weight of his arms around her as she'd teased, "Don't tell anyone this was my idea. Let them think the mighty Daniel Blackwood has a heart."

His responding smile had been a rare, tender thing. "They'll know. My employees deserve to see the woman behind the kindness."

She'd believed him. Expected to walk into his empire as the respected wife who championed worker rights.

Instead, she'd been met with sneers and sabotaged coffee. Meanwhile, Serena—Daniel's ever-present assistant—was adored. "They just find me more approachable," Serena had simpered, right before Evelyn discovered the truth: Serena had painted her as a vapid socialite stealing credit for Daniel's generosity.

The memories stung like fresh wounds as the car halted before Blackwood Tower.

"Ms. Carter, we're here."

"Ms. Carter!"

Before Theodore could exit, two mountain-sized bodyguards wrenched open Evelyn's door. Theodore scowled. "Tyler, Dominic—since when do you play chauffeur?"

"Not for you," Tyler snorted, elbowing past him. "Ms. Carter, I'm Tyler, this is Dominic. We're Liam's brothers. Consider us your personal security detail while you're here."

Evelyn's breath caught. "...Liam's brothers?"

The giants beamed like overgrown puppies.
###Chapter 179

"It's... complicated." Tyler rubbed his neck awkwardly. "I know it sounds unbelievable, but Dominic and I are decent guys. We follow Mr. Blackwood's orders to the letter. Since you're connected to him, we'll make sure you're taken care of."

Evelyn stared in shock. After a long pause, she managed a stiff, "Thanks..."

She trailed behind Theodore into the building, mentally kicking herself. Since when did Liam have two hulking 'brothers' like Tyler and Dominic?

"Ms. Carter," Theodore remarked dryly as they stepped into the elevator, "not only are you acquainted with Mr. Blackwood personally, but you're also on familiar terms with our security team. Had you joined Pierce Corporation sooner, you might've secured a permanent role instead of settling for an internship."

His tone dripped with sarcasm. Evelyn offered a thin smile. "I prefer interning. Same pay, less responsibility. Works for me."

She tilted her head. "Though I imagine your role as HR manager must be exhausting—juggling work while managing office politics. Sounds draining."

Theodore's expression darkened. He shot her a glare but stayed silent.

The design department occupied the 18th floor.

At the fifth floor, the elevator doors slid open to reveal a stunning woman holding a steaming coffee cup.

"Mr. Kingsley," she greeted Theodore with a polished smile. "I just left the CEO's office. Ethan mentioned Mr. Blackwood hired a new female employee?" Her voice was honey-sweet.

Theodore jerked his chin toward Evelyn. "Here she is. Meet our design intern, Evelyn Carter." He turned to Evelyn. "Evelyn, this is Audrey Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood's new assistant."

Audrey's gaze swept over Evelyn. "Hello," she chirped. "Lovely to meet you."

Evelyn lifted her head to respond—then froze.

Audrey's face was a mirror of Evelyn's pre-surgery self: the same heart-shaped smile, the same luminous eyes. For a dizzying moment, Evelyn was staring at her past.

She stole a glance at her reflection in the elevator's polished walls. Her new face was objectively prettier, yet...

"Evelyn." Theodore's sharp voice snapped her back. Audrey had already exited the elevator.

Theodore scowled. "Your connection to Mr. Blackwood doesn't entitle you to rudeness. Audrey introduced herself. Was a response too much to ask?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Sorry. I... forgot."

It wasn't a lie. Audrey's face had unleashed a flood of memories—both bitter and sweet.

Theodore rolled his eyes. "Your arrogance is baffling. Mr. Blackwood values professionalism. And Audrey wasn't hired randomly—she resembles his ex-wife. Tread carefully. She might just become the next Mrs. Blackwood."

Evelyn's lips twitched. "Don't be ridiculous."

Audrey only shared her old face. Years ago, Daniel had looked at that very face with pure disdain. Why would he marry its replica?

Theodore narrowed his eyes. "What's that supposed to mean?"
###Chapter 180

Theodore scoffed. "Mr. Blackwood insists his ex-wife is alive and that he's waiting for her return. But after all these years, it's obvious she's never coming back."

He leaned closer, lowering his voice. "If Mr. Blackwood ever gives up waiting and decides to remarry, Audrey will definitely be his first choice!"

Evelyn's lips curved slightly, but she remained silent. She didn't understand Theodore's confidence, though his assumption wasn't entirely unreasonable.

Even if Daniel changed his mind and wanted to marry someone resembling the old Evelyn, it no longer concerned her. Her only goal was to conceive his child to save Oliver.

As Evelyn lost herself in thought, the elevator dinged open on the 18th floor.

Theodore cleared his throat and guided her into the department. "Team, meet our newest member," he announced.

"This is Evelyn Carter. Our CEO, Mr. Blackwood, personally hired her as a design intern and assistant. Don't hesitate to ask for her help!" He gave Evelyn's shoulder a light pat. "Get acquainted with everyone."

With that, he strode off, leaving Evelyn alone.

Cassandra Montgomery, the department head, barely glanced at Evelyn before leading her to a dusty workstation. "You'll sit here," she said, slamming a thick stack of files onto the desk. A plume of dust erupted into the air.

"These are rejected proposals from the CEO. Take them back upstairs for resubmission." Cassandra smirked before walking away. "Don't screw it up."

Penelope Dawson, the college intern beside Evelyn, adjusted her glasses and whispered, "Be careful. This proposal's been rejected five times. Everyone who delivered it got chewed out by Mr. Blackwood. Cassandra's setting you up."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Do you have tissues?"

Penelope blinked before handing her a pack.

"Thanks." Evelyn wiped down the grimy desk. Instead of rushing upstairs, she settled into her chair and opened the file.

After skimming a few pages, her frown deepened. The designs were so poorly executed that even without Daniel's personal bias, anyone submitting this would face consequences.

Evelyn borrowed a pen and notepad from a nearby colleague, scribbling rapid notes. Then she stood, clutching the file. "Where's the CEO's office?"

Penelope hesitated. "Top floor."

"Thanks." Evelyn exhaled sharply before turning toward the elevators.

"What did she write?" another coworker asked Penelope.

Penelope bit her lip. "Not sure, but... she seems competent."

If Evelyn was truly skilled, why accept an intern position? Why tolerate Cassandra's bullying? Penelope couldn't make sense of it.

File in hand, Evelyn soon reached the executive floor. Through the glass walls of Daniel's office, she spotted Audrey Sinclair standing beside his desk, offering him coffee as he reviewed documents.

From this angle, they didn't look like boss and assistant—they resembled a picture-perfect couple.

Evelyn's breath hitched. It wasn't jealousy that tightened her chest, but the painful familiarity of the scene.

Years ago, she'd dreamed of this exact dynamic—standing beside Daniel as his equal, their partnership admired by all. He'd never allowed it.

Yet now, six years later, he let another woman occupy that space. A woman who mirrored Evelyn's past self so precisely it chilled her.

Perhaps the issue had never been her appearance. Daniel didn't hate how she looked—he hated who she was.
###Chapter 181

Evelyn's stare burned too intensely.

Daniel Blackwood glanced up from his paperwork, sensing the weight of her gaze across the office.

Their eyes locked.

Hers shifted from distant to startled. His transformed from surprise to icy detachment.

The silent standoff lasted until Audrey Sinclair finally noticed the tension.

She followed Daniel's line of sight to Evelyn.

"That's Evelyn Carter," Audrey explained with forced brightness. "Theodore Kingsley was just escorting her to Design for onboarding when we shared the elevator."

A practiced smile curved her lips. "Ms. Carter is quite striking. Her beauty practically hypnotized me during our ride up."

Daniel's brow furrowed at Audrey's words. He tore his gaze from Evelyn to study his assistant.

"You still haven't answered my question. I specifically requested Ethan hire a male secretary."

How had that translated to a carbon copy of Evelyn Carter standing in his office? Audrey knew exactly what game was being played here.

Color drained from Audrey's face. She ducked her head. "Mr. Blackwood, I assure you I'm fully qualified—"

"Who sent you?" Daniel pushed his chair back, creating deliberate distance.

He crossed his legs with aristocratic grace. "My father? Grandmother? Or someone more creative?"

The man missed nothing.

Audrey opened her mouth—

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Three sharp raps at the office door saved her. Spotting Evelyn through the glass, Audrey seized her escape.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'll get that!" She practically sprinted to the door.

Evelyn's fist hovered mid-air when the door swung open.

"Evelyn!" Audrey's voice dripped honey. "Here to report in? Come meet President Blackwood—he's been expecting you!"

The excessive warmth threw Evelyn off balance. She hesitated, eyes darting past Audrey to Daniel.

"Get in here." Daniel's clipped command cut through the awkwardness. His glacial stare at Audrey carried unspoken threats. "We'll continue this discussion later."

Audrey stiffened and fled.

The door clicked shut, thickening the silence.

Evelyn assumed the tension was directed at her. Squaring her shoulders, she approached his desk and placed a stack of designs before him.

"Mr. Blackwood, Design Director Montgomery asked me to deliver these proposals. Please review them at your convenience."

Daniel accepted the files but didn't open them. His large hand pressed down on the documents as his piercing gaze locked onto her.

"You actually showed up."

Evelyn's lips curved without warmth. "Pressure brings out my best work."
###Chapter 182

Daniel found it amusing.

"You claimed you'd never serve anyone again when you left Silvercrest Manor. Yet here you are, working in my company's design department, catering to my employees?"

Evelyn smiled without responding. "Mr. Blackwood requested it, so naturally, I complied."

"You'd do anything I say?"

"Of course." Her lips curved, eyes glinting with something dangerous. "When you told me not to move, I didn't. Do you remember that, Mr. Blackwood?"

His gaze darkened as it locked onto hers.

No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake her pull. Audrey Sinclair shared Evelyn Carter's face—more so than Evelyn herself—yet she barely stirred a reaction in him.

Unable to break away, he exhaled sharply and flipped through the design proposals on his desk.

"Did you review these?" His voice was clipped.

Evelyn noted the tension in his jaw. Since he'd shifted to business, she matched his tone. "I did."

Daniel's brows twitched. "Thoughts?"

"They're... unremarkable."

She delivered her critique calmly, standing before him.

His frown deepened. "Do you know who drafted these?"

Blackwood Group's jewelry design team wasn't as renowned as international names, but every designer had been handpicked. Each was invaluable.

These were the best of the best—yet to Evelyn, an outsider, their work was mediocre?

"I do." Her smile didn't waver. "But credentials don't define talent, do they? Potential can't be measured by rigid standards."

Her confidence gave him pause.

Once, another woman had stood before him with that same conviction, saying those exact words.

"Daniel, as CEO, you can't judge people by their résumés."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Blackwood?"

His gaze snapped back to hers, sharp and searching.

For a heartbeat, she faltered—realizing her mistake. She'd echoed words from their past.

Clearing her throat, she recovered. "Does my assessment make sense?"

Daniel exhaled. "It does."

"Good. I actually read that on Evelyn Carter's Twitter. She posted something similar once."

His tension eased slightly. He lifted his coffee, taking a slow sip before setting it down.

A mocking smile touched his lips. "I almost forgot how you mimicked her to get close to me." His expression hardened. "Clearly, you've done your homework to spy for Nathan Pierce."
###Chapter 183

"Pity I still fell short."

Evelyn met Daniel's gaze with a faint smile. "I overestimated your devotion to your ex-wife. People always spoke of how deeply you loved Evelyn Carter, but after getting close to you..."

Her eyes turned icy. "The reality doesn't match the rumors."

Daniel's brow furrowed. His voice dropped to a dangerous chill. "A few days of service doesn't grant you the right to interrogate me."

"Naturally." Evelyn's lips curved gracefully. "I've attended to Mr. Blackwood before. I'll admit I bear no resemblance to Evelyn Carter, yet you still crossed every line with me that night, didn't you?"

Her words dragged Daniel back to that reckless evening.

His expression darkened. The memory tightened his jaw.

That night... she had mirrored Evelyn so perfectly. Uncannily so.

If not for her face, he might have believed they were the same woman. But the truth was...

Daniel smirked. "Drunken mistakes aren't worth reminiscing."

Lowering his gaze, he tapped the design drafts. "Since you find these inadequate, what improvements would you suggest?"

"I have ideas."

Noting his abrupt subject change, Evelyn's smile turned frigid. She shifted to professional discussion.

She slid an A4 sheet across the table—notes borrowed earlier from Penelope.

"These are my thoughts."

Daniel studied the page, comparing it to the original designs. A flicker of surprise crossed his features.

His father had been right—Evelyn possessed remarkable talent. Her revisions transformed the mediocre concepts into something brilliant.

"Evelyn's exceptionally gifted. Set aside your prejudices and hire her. You won't regret it. And since you're searching for Evelyn Carter... rumors suggest this woman might be connected to her."

Gregory's words echoed in Daniel's mind. He masked his intrigue behind a neutral expression.

After a pause, he set the paper down with deliberate elegance. "Not bad."

"Merely personal observations."

Evelyn dipped her head modestly. "I'm hardly comparable to your formally trained designers."

Her humility left him no room for criticism.

Frowning, Daniel picked up a pen and transcribed her notes onto fresh paper in his own hand.

Though Evelyn despised him, she acknowledged the considerate gesture.

As a design department newcomer, presenting ideas directly could invite backlash. By rewriting them as his own instructions, he shielded her from scrutiny while ensuring implementation.

Workwise, his intelligence was undeniable.

But then...

Her gaze caught on his pen—an aged model with tooth marks near the nib.

Her birthday gift to him years ago, purchased with months of student savings.
###Chapter 184

That night after work, hunger gnawed at Evelyn. Half-asleep, she stumbled to the snack box and tore it open.

Her fingers brushed against something unfamiliar.

She’d accidentally unwrapped the gift meant for Daniel—and taken a bite of the pen inside.

Mortification flooded her. She expected disgust from him, but instead, he slid the pen into his shirt pocket with a faint smile. "A pen with teeth marks. Unique. Thank you."

Back then, his gentleness had unraveled her. She fell hard.

From that moment, she chased him relentlessly, deaf to objections. She would marry him.

Evelyn knew he never loved her. Still, she believed her fire could melt his ice.

Yet his heart remained untouched.

Now, confusion twisted inside her. Only they knew the pen’s origin. If he discarded it, no one would suspect his love for his ex-wife was a lie.

So why keep it? Why use it?

"Ms. Carter." Daniel’s voice snapped her back.

Startled, she jerked her gaze away. "Mr. Blackwood, are you done?"

"Yes." He slid the document into a folder, then eyed the pen. "You like it?"

She’d been staring too long.

Evelyn forced a laugh. "I didn’t expect… a dent like that on your pen."

Daniel glanced at the mark. "Not a bite. Just knocked it against something."

Her chest turned to stone. "Ah." She smiled, hollow. "I’ll leave you to your work."

She grabbed the files and left, the door clicking shut behind her.

Daniel watched her go, brow furrowed.

His eyes dropped to the paper on his desk—Evelyn’s neat script staring back.

Something prickled at his memory.

He snatched his phone. "Ethan. Go to Silvercrest Manor. In my study, top shelf—bring me Evelyn Carter’s diary."

Ethan hesitated. "Sir… why now?"

The study was a graveyard of her ghosts. Before, it haunted him because she was dead. Now, it haunted him because she wasn’t—and he was still waiting.

"Just get it," Daniel gritted out. "And call a handwriting analyst."
###Chapter 185

All eyes discreetly followed Evelyn as she reentered the design department, searching for any trace of distress after her meeting with the company's CEO.

They found nothing.

Evelyn walked calmly to her desk, arms full of documents.

Beside her, Penelope adjusted her glasses, studying Evelyn's expression. "Did the proposal get approved?"

Evelyn didn't look like someone who had just been reprimanded.

It was worth noting that several designers had already returned from the CEO's office in tears before Evelyn went in.

Some had entered with confidence, only to break down afterward.

Rumors said Daniel Blackwood never raised his voice—his icy stare alone could make anyone confess their mistakes.

Every woman who had faced him swore never to step into his office again.

But Evelyn looked... unfazed.

Had her proposal actually been approved?

"No," Evelyn answered flatly, pouring herself tea. "Mr. Blackwood pointed out several issues."

Penelope hesitated before whispering, "You... didn't get scolded?"

"Why would I? I didn't do anything wrong."

Evelyn took a sip of tea, then stood to head to the director's office.

When Cassandra saw Evelyn enter, she immediately set aside her work.

"What did the CEO say?"

Evelyn opened the document and placed Daniel's handwritten notes in front of Cassandra.

"From Mr. Blackwood."

Cassandra's expression shifted as soon as she glanced at the paper.

On one hand, this was the first time the CEO had provided such flawless feedback.

Though Daniel was brilliant in business, jewelry design was a specialized field. He could judge a proposal's quality, but he rarely dissected details with such precision.

This time, however, his notes were not only comprehensive but pinpointed every flaw with surgical accuracy.

On the other hand...

This was the first handwritten note Daniel had ever given to any department.

As the company's leader, he always had assistants record his feedback. To receive something personally written by him...

Evelyn was the first.

Cassandra looked up, stunned. "Evelyn, why would the CEO give you a handwritten note? What's your relationship with him?"

"A professional one. He's my employer." Evelyn smiled slightly. "He thought I might struggle with verbal communication, so he wrote his thoughts down instead."

She met Cassandra's gaze. "Is that a problem?"

"N-No! Not at all!" Cassandra took a deep breath and patted Evelyn's shoulder.

"In that case, you'll handle all future reports to the CEO!"

She immediately called over a staff member. "Frame this and hang it on the wall!"

In all her years at the company, Cassandra had never seen Daniel's handwriting.

This was unprecedented—an honor for the entire design department!

Evelyn stood frozen, watching as Cassandra and the staff carefully framed the single sheet of paper.

After a moment, she shook her head with an amused sigh.

What exactly was happening?

The notes Daniel had copied were essentially a meticulous critique of the designers' shortcomings.
###Chapter 186

To Evelyn's surprise, Cassandra wasn't the least bit ashamed—she actually seemed proud?

Now Evelyn understood why even the simplest jewelry design proposal required at least five revisions.

The designers in the department... clearly had no passion for their work.

"You're incredible." Back at her desk, Penelope grinned and slid a stick of gum toward Evelyn.

"You're the only one in this department who hasn't been torn apart by the CEO or scared out of your wits. And you even came back with his handwritten notes! I bet you won't stay an intern for long."

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or sigh. She unwrapped the gum and popped it into her mouth. "You're exaggerating."

"Not at all! Everyone knows how ruthless Mr. Blackwood is. No one dares to get close to him. CEOs at other companies might flirt with their employees, but ours? He only cares about his ex-wife. HR keeps trying to hire women who resemble her just to keep him happy."

At Penelope's words, Evelyn's brows furrowed. She suddenly thought of Audrey, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Serena Hart.

The image of Audrey in Daniel's office flashed through her mind again—they had looked like a perfect couple.

The thought inexplicably irritated her.

"Got any more gum? Give me another piece."

Penelope pursed her lips and handed over the last stick. "This is it. Audrey gave me a few this morning."

Without a word, Evelyn returned the unopened gum and spat out the one she was chewing.

Penelope blinked in surprise.

Evelyn smiled calmly. "Sorry. I almost forgot—I'm allergic to gum."

Top floor, Blackwood Group headquarters.

Two gray-haired experts hunched over a desk, comparing handwriting samples with a magnifying glass and precision calipers.

Finally, they reached a conclusion.

"Mr. Blackwood, I understand you're searching for your ex-wife. I know this must be difficult for you."

One expert removed his glasses and sighed. "But I must be honest—these two samples were written by different people. The strokes and writing habits are completely distinct. There's no way they came from the same hand."

Daniel's frown deepened.

Truthfully, the moment Ethan had brought Serena Hart's diary, he'd already noticed the stark differences.

Yet when he saw Evelyn's handwriting, something about it had reminded him of Serena.

"I disagree."

The second expert wiped sweat from his brow.

"At first glance, they appear different, but if you examine the strokes and letter endings closely, it's clear the writer of this note was deliberately avoiding any resemblance to the diary. That's why it looks so unnatural. However, everyone has subconscious writing patterns—and when you compare them, the similarities are undeniable."

He lifted Evelyn's note. "So why would someone go out of their way to disguise their handwriting like this?"

Daniel was silent for a long moment. Then his eyes sharpened. "Then... if we can get her to write naturally, without forcing differences—we'll have our answer?"
###Chapter 187

Evelyn Carter found herself staring at a daunting task - copying a 20,000-word document by hand.

The moment Cassandra Montgomery dropped the thick stack of papers on her desk, Evelyn's stomach twisted. These weren't design guidelines or department protocols.

They were the entire Pierce Corporation's rules and regulations.

"Submit it before you clock out today," Cassandra said curtly before walking away.

Penelope Dawson adjusted her glasses, doing quick mental math. "Twenty thousand words... five working hours left... you'd need to write sixty-seven words per minute."

An impossible feat. Penelope tucked her phone away with a frown.

"This makes no sense. You haven't done anything wrong today. Why is management suddenly targeting you?"

Evelyn calmly gathered pen and paper. "Perhaps Mr. Blackwood requested this personally," she said with a humorless smile.

The sudden shift in treatment was suspicious. One moment Cassandra had been professional, the next she'd issued this absurd order without explanation.

"You're actually going to do it?" Penelope's lips pursed in disapproval.

Evelyn's pen was already moving across the page. "When the boss gives an order, you follow it. That's how employment works."

She didn't understand Daniel Blackwood's game, but this internship was hard-won. She wouldn't surrender so easily.

Then she noticed the problem.

In her haste, her handwriting was slipping into familiar patterns - the same ones she'd spent months training herself to avoid.

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration.

She couldn't risk Daniel recognizing similarities to Evelyn Carter's distinctive script. Before returning, she'd painstakingly altered her writing style to suggest imitation rather than genuine resemblance.

But twenty years of muscle memory couldn't be erased overnight.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Maybe Daniel wouldn't scrutinize her handwriting that closely. He probably just wanted to harass the supposed corporate spy, not uncover her true identity.

She resumed writing at breakneck speed, skipping lunch until Penelope brought her a sandwich.

"Progress?" Penelope peeked at the pages. "Your penmanship is beautiful, at least."

Between bites, Penelope shook her head. "Management's gone mad. First they favor you, now this?"

Evelyn offered a tight smile before returning to her task. While colleagues attended afternoon meetings, she remained chained to her desk.

By day's end, the stack of handwritten pages was complete.

Cassandra didn't look up when Evelyn entered her office. "Take it directly to Mr. Blackwood," she said coldly.
###Chapter 188

Cassandra Montgomery smirked down at Evelyn Carter with obvious superiority. "I believed we had such exceptional employees that the CEO would personally handwrite his notes. Turns out he's just toying with you. Making you suffer."

She took a deliberate sip of her tea. "If I were in your position, I'd have resigned by lunchtime. He's clearly targeting you. Where's your self-respect? Have you no dignity?"

Evelyn turned sharply on her heel.

Her icy glare pinned Cassandra in place. "So enduring unfair treatment makes me shameless?"

Cassandra spun her pen lazily, reclining further into her chair. "What else would you call it?"

"Then explain this." Evelyn snatched up her painstakingly handwritten documents, eyes blazing. "Daniel Blackwood rejected your design proposal five times. Yet here you are, revising it for the sixth submission."

She leaned in. "By your logic, shouldn't you have thrown these in his face and stormed out?"

The door slammed behind Evelyn, leaving Cassandra gaping at the empty space.

A resounding crash echoed from the design head's office—a teacup meeting its violent end against the floor. Evelyn's lips curled in cold amusement as she ascended to the executive floor.

Daniel remained entrenched in meetings. Ethan Reynolds intercepted her at the entrance. "Evelyn, the session's running late. At least another thirty minutes."

Rather than face Cassandra's venomous clique, Evelyn chose the plush waiting area sofa. Her aching shoulders protested as she massaged them—twelve hours of nonstop writing had taken its toll.

"Ms. Carter?" A saccharine voice interrupted. Audrey Sinclair materialized before her, the afternoon sun gilding her corporate miniskirt ensemble.

Evelyn stiffened as the woman's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Mind if I join you?"

She edged aside wordlessly.

"Here to see President Blackwood too?" Audrey's perfume invaded Evelyn's space as she perched on the couch. "First day and already reporting twice? How... special."

Evelyn retreated slightly. "Consider it penance for displeasing him this morning." She gestured to the stacked papers. "Company regulations, handwritten by sunset. My peace offering."

A calculated pause. Then Evelyn caught the predatory gleam in Audrey's gaze.

As Daniel's personal secretary, Audrey had witnessed the handwriting analysts earlier. Their departing words still echoed: "Force them to write under time pressure—stress erases disguised penmanship."

So that was the game.

"Oops!" Audrey's coffee cup "accidentally" tipped, dark liquid spreading across the documents.

Ethan immediately summoned cleaning staff. As mops arrived, Audrey turned with feigned concern and—
###Chapter 189

"May I take a look?" Evelyn gestured toward the documents on the table with a polite smile.

Daniel hesitated momentarily before lifting his teacup. "Go ahead." His handwriting wasn't elegant, but it wasn't atrocious either.

Company policies weren't classified documents, so Evelyn had every right to examine them.

"Thank you!" She beamed, picking up the papers with delicate fingers.

"Your penmanship is exquisite!" Evelyn flipped through the pages with exaggerated admiration, carefully removing sheets from their folders.

Daniel narrowed his eyes but remained silent.

When janitors passed by with a cleaning bucket, Evelyn's hands "accidentally" jerked, sending every handwritten page into the murky water.

Ink bled across the soaked papers instantly.

Both cleaners and Evelyn gasped. They scrambled to retrieve the ruined documents.

"Oh Daniel, I'm so sorry!" Evelyn's voice trembled with false distress. "Shall I speak to Mr. Blackwood for you? Maybe he'll show mercy?"

Her eyes glistened with crocodile tears. "Since I resemble his ex-wife, perhaps my plea will carry more weight."

Daniel set his teacup down with deliberate calm, regarding her with detached amusement.

"Fine." He stretched lazily. "You'll go explain this to Vincent first. I'll wait outside. If you can make him forget this incident, I won't press charges. But if he demands I rewrite everything tomorrow..."

His gaze flicked to the security camera. "We'll review the footage together. See whether this was truly an accident."

Evelyn's face drained of color.

Her lips trembled. "It was an accident! Why would I do it intentionally?"

"Hard to say." Daniel shifted comfortably on the sofa.

After years of Serena's manipulations, he'd become an expert at spotting schemes. He'd recognized Evelyn's game the moment she "spilled" her coffee earlier.

The only reason he hadn't stopped her? He didn't actually want Vincent seeing his handwriting.

Preventing it himself was one thing. Being sabotaged was another.

If Evelyn wanted to play games, he'd happily oblige.

Their standoff - one feigning distress, the other radiating calm - was interrupted by Ethan's announcement: "Mr. Blackwood's meeting has concluded."

"Who's going in first? Or shall I send you both?"

"Her first." Both spoke simultaneously.

Daniel arched a brow. "You want me to go first? If Vincent asks about the documents, I'll suggest reviewing security footage."

Evelyn paled.

With visible reluctance, she entered Vincent's office.

As the door opened, Daniel called after her, "Don't forget to plead my case!"

The door slammed shut.

Sipping tea, Daniel observed their tense exchange through the glass walls.

Clearly, resembling Daniel Blackwood's ex-wife granted Evelyn no special privileges.

He sighed.

Watching Evelyn face Vincent's icy demeanor was like looking in a mirror - seeing his own past naivety reflected back.

Ten minutes later, Evelyn emerged red-eyed, fleeing toward the elevators without a backward glance.

Daniel almost pitied her. She was exactly like his former self.

Present-day Daniel wanted to hug his past self and whisper: It gets better.

"Daniel." Ethan's voice snapped him back to reality.

Collecting the soggy papers from the janitors, he entered the office.

The water-stained documents landed on Vincent's desk with a damp thud.

Daniel met Vincent's gaze with a smirk. "My hard work, Mr. Blackwood. Copied word for word until your assistant decided they belonged in a mop bucket."

Vincent studied the ruined papers without touching them.

Leaning back, he fixed Daniel with a penetrating stare. "Anything else to say?"

"Nothing." Daniel shrugged.

Then he leaned forward, eyes smoldering. "Unless you'd like me to say... something more interesting? I can satisfy any request - in bed or out of it."

Vincent's jaw tightened.

After a beat, he smirked. "You've been dropping these hints since that night. Want a repeat performance?"

Daniel shook his head. "Once wasn't enough. Remember your offer to keep me?"

"I have a wife."

"You mean Evelyn Carter? Your not-quite-ex?"

"We never divorced."

"But she's not coming back."

"How do you know?"

Daniel's smile turned feline. "If she wanted to return, she would have. Unless..."

He trailed a finger along the desk's edge. "Unless you make me your lover. Maybe jealousy will bring her running back."

His eyes sparkled with mischief. "What do you think, Mr. Blackwood?"
###Chapter 190

Evelyn did it all on purpose.

Daniel was full of lies. He kept claiming he wanted Evelyn Carter back, but in truth, he just wanted her gone forever, didn’t he?

Her words gave him the perfect excuse to drop the act.

The office fell into heavy silence for several seconds before Daniel finally smirked. "Not a bad idea."

Evelyn was only angry with him. She didn’t not love him. If she refused to return no matter what he did, then Evelyn’s suggestion was the next best option. If he needed a woman to play this role, at least Evelyn didn’t disgust him.

Besides, what happened that night was his fault. He had treated her as a replacement for Evelyn Carter. He owed her that much.

If she wanted to reclaim this identity and stay by his side to steal corporate secrets, fine. He’d give her the chance.

Consider it… repayment.

Daniel exhaled sharply, lifting his gaze to study her. "But I have one condition."

Evelyn smiled, though her eyes remained cold. "Name it, Mr. Blackwood."

"We act."

Her expression twisted. "Act?"

"Yes." His voice was flat, his dark eyes unreadable.

"If this is about luring my wife out, we only need to pretend in public. Privately, we stay just friends."

Evelyn’s brows furrowed.

They were already at this point. Why was Daniel still pretending to be noble? Still, it was better than nothing.

Being by his side as his "girlfriend" was far better than being his maid.

She inhaled deeply, forcing a smile. "Fine."

Seeing her compliance, Daniel lowered his gaze back to his work.

"I’ll have Ethan arrange for you and Liam to move into Silvercrest Manor. I’ll also announce you as my new girlfriend publicly. Be ready."

Maybe Evelyn Carter wouldn’t react if his ex-fiancée was Serena Hart.

But if it was Evelyn? She’d have to respond.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Will it be on the news?"

"Obviously." His tone was sharp. "If I’m not making sure Evelyn Carter sees it, why bother cooperating with you?"

"Then play it on loop at Willowbrook Asylum." Her smile turned icy. "If you won’t take my advice on punishing Serena, surely you can agree to something this simple?"

Daniel’s fingers stilled on the documents. His gaze darkened. "How do you know about that?"

The public believed Serena was studying abroad.

"That’s for you to figure out, Mr. Blackwood." She turned gracefully, hand on the door. "Are all your guards really that loyal?"

If no one was feeding Serena information, how had she contacted Victoria three separate times?

Daniel’s jaw tightened. Only after she left did he call Ethan in.

"Replace the guards watching Serena."

Ethan blinked. "Did they mess up?"

"You could say that."
###Chapter 191

Daniel Blackwood methodically flipped through the files. "Once they're replaced, make sure to bring back two of the original guards who watched over Serena Hart. Keep tabs on the first two applicants. Run a full background check."

Ethan Reynolds hesitated for a moment before understanding Daniel's intentions. He inhaled sharply and turned to leave.

"Wait." Daniel pointed at the waterlogged documents. "Have someone dry these. Then get the handwriting experts to analyze them again."

Ethan frowned. "They're practically ruined. I doubt the experts can salvage anything useful."

Daniel's gaze remained steady. "They'll figure it out."

Whether it was his imagination or not, Daniel couldn't shake the feeling that despite the smudges, the handwriting bore an uncanny resemblance to Evelyn Carter's.

"Audrey, stop crying."

When Evelyn returned to the design department, she found a group of designers huddled around Audrey Sinclair, with Cassandra Montgomery leading the comforting efforts.

Bathed in sympathy, Audrey sniffled dramatically as she wiped her tears. "I really didn't mean to do it. The CEO wants me to apologize to Evelyn, so I'm waiting here. When is she coming back?"

Cassandra sighed, dabbing Audrey's cheeks while muttering, "Just wait a little longer. That woman is cunning. She's been gone for ages—probably off somewhere trying to seduce the CEO again."

Her words only made Audrey sob harder.

Audrey gasped between hiccupping cries. "It's my first day, and I've been working so hard. I didn't do anything wrong! I just thought she was pretty. It's not just the CEO who likes her—I do too! That's why I sat next to her. I was just nervous, and that's how I spilled my coffee on her work. I swear it was an accident! I don't understand why the CEO got so angry..."

She wiped her tears pitifully. "Do you think she'll forgive me?"

"No, she won't." A cold voice cut through the room.

Everyone turned.

Evelyn strode in, her tall frame exuding icy elegance. "Your acting skills are impressive. Crying on command? You'd make a fortune in Hollywood."

Her sharp tone and unapproachable aura left the room in stunned silence.

Audrey blinked, momentarily caught off guard, before quickly recovering.

"Evelyn, I swear it was an accident!" She stood, sniffling. "You're just so beautiful, I got nervous sitting next to you. Please forgive me? The CEO said I have to apologize, or else..."

Her voice cracked dramatically. "Or else I'll be reported at tomorrow's company meeting, and if I mess up again, I'll be fired! But I didn't even do anything that bad! It was just a mistake!"

Cassandra's protective instincts flared. She shot Evelyn a glare. "She didn't do it on purpose. Why can't you just let it go? How long are you going to drag this out? Audrey is my protégée. If you want to keep working as a designer at Blackwood Corporation, you'll forgive her right now. Otherwise, I'll make sure you regret it!"

Evelyn arched a brow.

She sank into her chair, crossing her long legs on the desk. Picking up a nearby file, she flipped through it lazily before smirking. "Ah, so now you're threatening my job? No wonder Blackwood's jewelry designs have been so uninspired lately. Too much energy wasted on petty office drama."
###Chapter 192

Cassandra's words turned Evelyn's face pale with rage.

The usually composed department head lost all pretense of elegance. "Who do you think you are?" she snapped, voice sharp as shattered glass. "An intern lecturing professionals? What do you know about jewelry design? Unless you're the legendary designer Celeste herself, your opinion means nothing!"

Evelyn's lips twitched at the mention of her former alias.

"Evelyn." Audrey approached hesitantly, eyes red-rimmed. "Please forgive me. If you don't, the president will—"

"Fine," Evelyn cut in coldly. Pointing at Cassandra, she smirked. "Make her kowtow to me three hundred times, and we're even."

Cassandra's face twisted. "In your dreams!"

"Then keep dreaming."

Evelyn checked her watch, gathered her belongings, and strode toward the exit without another glance. The stunned designers could only glare at her retreating figure.

Penelope, who'd witnessed the entire confrontation, rushed after her. She found Evelyn waiting at the bus stop, posture relaxed as if she hadn't just upended office politics.

"That was incredible!" Penelope gasped, touching Evelyn's shoulder. "No one's ever shut Cassandra down like that before!"

Evelyn watched the approaching bus. "Really?"

"Absolutely." Penelope lowered her voice. "Cassandra's untouchable because of Mrs. Blackwood's favor. She thinks Daniel won't oppose his grandmother, so she walks all over everyone—even his ex-fiancée, Serena Hart!"

Penelope studied Evelyn's expression carefully. "Do you know Serena? She was—"

"Bus is here." Evelyn stepped forward, boarding without hesitation.

Left speechless on the sidewalk, Penelope clenched her fists as the vehicle pulled away.

She was certain Evelyn was connected to Daniel Blackwood. Getting close to her would lead to Serena's whereabouts eventually.

Closing her eyes, Penelope pictured a man's face.

"Don't worry, brother. I'll make them pay..."

At the kindergarten, children were already lining up for dismissal.

Liam held little Sophia's hand at the back of the line. Spotting Evelyn, they broke into identical grins.

"Auntie!" "Mommy!"

They crashed into her embrace.

Isabelle emerged from the shadows, sighing when she saw Sophia in Evelyn's arms. "Miss Sophia, Mr. Blackwood wishes you home early tonight."

Then, bowing her head, she added, "Ms. Carter, I owe you an apology for last night's incident."

Evelyn paused, recalling the burn on her hand. Though painful at the time, Liam had stayed up applying ointment until the sting faded. Now only faint marks remained.
###Chapter 193

The paperwork Evelyn had to copy during office hours barely stung.

"Mr. Blackwood reprimanded me yesterday. Then Mr. Pierce scolded me today." Isabelle lifted her tear-streaked face. "I know I messed up."

Evelyn hesitated before placing a comforting hand on Isabelle's shoulder. "I know you meant well. Ignore their harsh words - I understand. I'll be more careful about this issue moving forward. And I'll maintain better communication with Nathan."

Isabelle froze, completely unprepared for Evelyn's gentle response. The unexpected kindness left her speechless.

Sophia sighed dramatically before planting a quick kiss on Evelyn's cheek. She then grabbed Isabelle's hand firmly. "Come on, Isabelle! Let's go!"

Watching Sophia lead Isabelle away, Liam frowned deeply. "Why are you being so nice to her?"

"Everyone makes mistakes," Evelyn replied softly, taking Liam's small hand in hers. "She looked after you three diligently during our years abroad. I won't hold grudges over small things."

As they walked toward the bus stop, Evelyn recounted her day to Liam - about Tyler and Dominic, about her new colleague Rebecca Dawson.

"Mom, you're being naive," a child's serious voice suddenly chimed in through her necklace.

Evelyn paused mid-step, realizing the voice came from the pendant Oliver had made for everyone. She'd stopped wearing it during their argument about returning to the country, but after the Skywheel incident, she'd put it back on.

"Why am I being naive?" Evelyn asked, brows knitting together.

"I've done a background check on Rebecca." Oliver's voice came through clearly as he lounged on his hospital bed, afternoon sunlight painting golden stripes across his sheets.

"She graduated with a degree in Mass Communications. She's not a design intern - she's a journalist. Specifically, one who specialized in negative coverage about Serena Hart. After Serena's scandal broke, she suddenly quit her newspaper job and reinvented herself as a design intern at Blackwood Corporation."

Oliver's tone grew more serious. "At first I thought she might be Serena's ally, publishing hit pieces to boost Serena's notoriety. But no - she genuinely despises Serena. While her other reporting is balanced, she's vicious when it comes to Serena."

His voice softened. "Mom, you might want to get close to her. There's clearly deeper history between them. But be careful - she doesn't seem friendly."

Evelyn's mind reeled. How could this be? The image of Rebecca's sweet, obedient smile flashed in her mind. Yet she knew Oliver's research was never wrong.

Preoccupied with these thoughts, Evelyn brought Liam home. As they reached their apartment, they found someone waiting by their door.

Victoria Sinclair stood up quickly when she saw them. "Ms. Carter. I heard you're working at Blackwood Corporation now."

The exhaustion etched on Victoria's face tugged at Evelyn's heart.

Evelyn bit her lip. "Why are you here?" she asked while unlocking the door. "Come inside first. How long have you been waiting?"

"That's unnecessary." Victoria instinctively stepped back. "We barely know each other. I just came to ask if you have any news about my daughter."

Evelyn's hand froze on the doorknob.

A quiet thought echoed in her mind: But I am your daughter too.
###Chapter 194

"Ma'am, let's go inside to talk." Liam noticed the dark expression on Evelyn's face and quickly stepped forward, tugging gently at Victoria's sleeve with a charming smile. "Our neighborhood is small, and people talk. It's better to discuss this privately."

Victoria frowned, ready to refuse—until she got a proper look at Liam's face.

That face...

It inexplicably reminded her of Evelyn when she was young. The boy's aura, his scent, even those wide, starry eyes—they were identical to Evelyn's as a child.

All resistance left her as she stared at him.

After a long pause, Victoria sighed and allowed Liam to guide her inside.

The house appeared ordinary from the outside, but the interior told a different story. Though simply decorated, the walls and ceilings bore faint scorch marks that even fresh paint couldn't fully conceal.

Victoria froze. "Your home—"

"Ms. Serena had someone set it on fire." Liam led her to the sofa before taking a seat across from her, his large, innocent eyes sparkling. "Mommy and Emily were still inside when it happened. If they hadn't been rescued in time, they would've died."

His words struck Victoria like a blow.

"That can't be true. Serena is Emily's aunt—she would never do such a thing. Someone must have lied to you!"

She glanced around at the lingering burn marks, as if trying to convince herself. "Impossible."

"Tea." Evelyn emerged from the kitchen, carrying a freshly brewed pot. "Today was my first day at Blackwood Group. I haven't had much contact with Daniel yet."

She took a slow breath, steadying herself. "So, I don't have any updates on Serena."

Placing the cup in front of Victoria, she forced a polite smile. "Aunt Victoria, please have some."

It was earl grey—Victoria's favorite. But the older woman barely glanced at it, her frown deepening as she remained stiff on the sofa. "When will you have news? You're a mother too—you must understand how it feels when your child is missing. I can't sleep, I can't eat, thinking about Serena."

Evelyn's smile stayed fixed in place.

Her gaze dropped to the steaming tea, and before she could stop herself, the question slipped out. "Back then... when Evelyn Carter went missing, did you feel the same way?"

She searched Victoria's face for any flicker of emotion, any sign of remembrance.

But Victoria only shook her head.

"Evelyn is my daughter too, but... she could never compare to Serena. Serena is kind, gentle—she's done so much for Evelyn in secret, yet Evelyn never once thanked her."

She sighed. "And let's not forget—Serena met Daniel Blackwood first. She was gracious enough to step aside, but Evelyn still pushed her away at every turn."

Evelyn stood rooted to the spot, her entire body rigid. "Did... Serena tell you all this?"

She couldn't believe it. Her own mother—whom she had always respected—would say such things about her.

"Not everything. I saw some of it myself."

Victoria exhaled heavily. "Evelyn is my daughter too, but she's just... different."

Evelyn felt something inside her shatter.

She inhaled sharply, forcing the pain down. "I understand. I don't have any information on Serena right now. When I do, I'll let you know immediately."

Her voice was steady, but her hands trembled. "Liam, please see Aunt Victoria out."

Liam took one look at Evelyn's ashen face and his heart ached.

He hopped off the sofa and rushed to the door, swinging it open. "Aunt Victoria, you should go now."

Victoria's brows knitted together as she studied the boy's suddenly cold demeanor.

Just moments ago, he had been so eager to bring her inside. Now, he was practically shoving her out.

"I was just invited in with such enthusiasm," she said sharply. "Why the sudden change?"
###Chapter 195

Evelyn's gaze turned icy as she stared at Victoria. "Weren't you refusing to come inside earlier?"

Victoria stood speechless.

After a long pause, she sighed, grabbed her purse, and walked out.

The door slammed shut.

The moment Victoria left, Evelyn's tears finally broke free, streaming down her cheeks.

Family had always been her priority. She blamed herself for not reaching out while abroad.

Even before, she knew Victoria would misunderstand her, chalking it up to their years apart.

But hearing Victoria say she hadn't cared when Evelyn went missing—that was the wake-up call. No one had ever truly loved her.

No one.

Not her family. Not her lover. Only Serena mattered to them.

"Mommy, you still have us." Liam's small voice came from behind her unexpectedly.

His tiny fingers wrapped around hers. "We'll always protect you."

Evelyn turned and pulled Liam into a tight embrace, silent tears soaking his shirt.

That night, she slept curled around Liam. He'd once declared that real men took care of women.

His maturity shamed her into swallowing her grief.

At dawn, Ethan arrived with an entourage, knocking sharply.

"Ms. Carter." The man who usually called her by name now used formalities. "Mr. Blackwood's car is waiting. You and Young Master Liam should come now. We'll have your belongings sent to Silvercrest Manor."

Evelyn hesitated. "Alright."

She glanced at Liam, whose expression remained unreadable until he flashed her a brilliant smile. Then he glared at Ethan. "What about Sophia?"

"Waiting in the car with Mr. Blackwood."

"Perfect!" Liam exhaled dramatically. He grabbed his jacket and backpack, tugging Evelyn forward. "Let's go, Mommy!"

Following her son, Evelyn studied the back of his determined little head. "Aren't you going to ask what's happening?"

She'd planned to explain everything about Daniel last night, but Victoria's visit had derailed her.

Now Liam wasn't even questioning Daniel's sudden involvement.

"Oliver told me everything," Liam whispered. "Do what you need to, Mommy. We've got your back as long as you're safe."

Her heart swelled painfully.

Evelyn squeezed his hand tighter.

Daniel's sleek black car stood out like a diamond in coal among the modest neighborhood vehicles, drawing curious onlookers.

"Brother!" Sophia came sprinting the moment she spotted them, nearly tripping in her excitement.

After months of secrecy, she could finally claim Liam openly!

She crashed into him with a bear hug.

Liam rolled his eyes. "We literally saw each other yesterday."

Sophia pouted, wedging herself between Evelyn and Liam, clutching both their hands as they approached the car.

Watching from the backseat, Daniel frowned. An odd thought struck him.

Why did Sophia resemble Evelyn so much?
###Chapter 196

Liam, Sophia, and Evelyn climbed into the sleek black sedan.

Liam took the front passenger seat while Evelyn and Sophia settled in the back beside Daniel.

Daniel lounged elegantly against the plush leather, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "It just occurred to me—Sophia bears a slight resemblance to you as well."

Evelyn's posture stiffened instantly. Sophia's expression flickered with unease.

"All stunning women share similar features," Liam remarked casually from the front, fastening his seatbelt with practiced ease.

"Pretty faces follow patterns. It's the unattractive ones who stand out in their own unfortunate ways."

Liam's dry humor nearly drew a laugh from Ethan at the wheel.

Both Evelyn and Sophia visibly relaxed.

Daniel, however, chuckled lowly. "Perhaps. But..." His gaze slid toward Evelyn. "Sophia still favors my wife, Evelyn Carter."

Evelyn steadied herself and offered him a practiced smile. "Naturally."

She wasn't the same woman she'd been years ago—her appearance had changed entirely.

"Sophia," Liam interjected smoothly, diffusing the tension, "did that boy who gave you candy this morning bother you again later?"

Sophia shook her head. "No. He asked me to be his girlfriend. I said no."

Daniel and Evelyn frowned in unison, their earlier debate forgotten as they both turned to scrutinize Sophia.

"A boy tried to win you over with candy?"

"You're in kindergarten. Dating isn't appropriate."

Sophia suddenly felt the weight of their combined attention. She shot Liam an exasperated glare through the rearview mirror before explaining carefully.

"Well, I—"

The drive from Evelyn's home to the kindergarten took over ten minutes. Sophia spent the entire time clarifying the incident, attempting to reassure Daniel and Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Liam reclined lazily in the front seat, basking in the sunlight.

He exchanged a few light remarks with Ethan. "Perfect weather today."

Ethan sighed. "You really know how to redirect a conversation."

Liam smirked. "Better than debating who Sophia takes after, don't you think?"

Soon, the car pulled up outside the kindergarten.

Only after Sophia promised repeatedly that she wouldn't entertain any admirers—and Liam vowed to keep a close eye on her—did they finally exit the vehicle.

As the car door shut, Evelyn watched them disappear inside and exhaled heavily. "So concerning."

Daniel arched a brow. "For the record, Sophia is my daughter," he said coolly. "Anyone listening might mistake her for yours."

Evelyn's eyes dimmed briefly before she laughed softly. "I've cared for her long enough to feel attached."

Then she turned away, staring silently out the window.

"Once we reach the office," Daniel said evenly, "I'll announce your presence. You'll have your chance to 'steal' corporate secrets—if you're capable. Just remember to play your part convincingly. If you perform well, I might even feed you some information."

Evelyn suppressed a scoff. Blackwood Enterprises' secrets meant nothing to her.

The only thing she truly wanted from him... Her thoughts drifted to that night.

She forced the memory away.

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood." She smiled. "I'll give an award-winning performance."

The car arrived at Blackwood Tower.
###Chapter 197

Evelyn Carter assumed Daniel Blackwood would reveal her identity during the morning executive meeting or some other formal setting.

She never expected the entire upper management to be waiting outside Blackwood Tower the moment their car pulled up.

Rows of employees and executives flanked both sides of the entrance, forming a clear path down the middle.

From inside the car, Evelyn saw a sea of black suits lining the red carpet.

She had never witnessed such a grand reception before.

Turning to Daniel, she blinked in disbelief.

"This is how we greet VIPs at Blackwood Group," he murmured, voice low and steady. "You're the first woman I've ever granted this honor."

Evelyn's lips parted slightly.

Was all this really necessary?

A sharp knock sounded on the car door.

Audrey Sinclair stood outside, radiant in a blush-pink gown, her long curls pinned back with a delicate crystal hairpiece. She looked every bit the fairytale princess.

She smiled sweetly as she tapped the window. "Mr. Blackwood, are you ready to step out? Has our special guest arrived?"

Daniel swung the door open without hesitation.

Audrey's gaze flickered past him—and her polished smile shattered.

Because sitting behind Daniel was Evelyn Carter, the woman who had humiliated her just yesterday.

Audrey's lips pressed into a thin line before she forced another smile. "Did you happen to run into Ms. Carter on your way here? How kind of you to offer her a ride."

Her icy glare shifted to Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, while it's lovely that you're acquainted with Mr. Blackwood, we're expecting important guests today. Why are you still in the car? If they see you, they might mistake you for one of Blackwood Group's representatives."

Evelyn smirked. "Right. I'll get out then."

She moved to exit, but Daniel's arm blocked her.

He stepped out first, towering over Audrey, who immediately flushed under his proximity. Her pulse raced—being this close to him was intoxicating.

"Mr. Blackwood, you—"

Before she could finish, Daniel reached into the car and effortlessly scooped Evelyn into his arms.

Audrey's face went slack with shock.

Gasps rippled through the crowd—including from Penelope Dawson and Cassandra Montgomery. Every employee and executive of Blackwood Group stood frozen.

Even Evelyn stiffened in his hold, too stunned to struggle. "What are you doing?" she whispered urgently.

"This," he murmured against her ear, voice rough with amusement, "is how my woman should be treated."

With that, he carried her past the stunned assembly and straight into the building.

Evelyn, thrown off-balance, instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck, her body pressed flush against his. She could feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, the warmth of his breath.

And that scent—the intoxicating pheromones she'd been addicted to for nearly a decade.

She tilted her head up, studying the sharp line of his jaw.

Around them, whispers erupted. Evelyn had never been the center of attention like this before.

Her fingers tightened around his neck, heart torn between aching nostalgia and bitter irony.

Once, she had dreamed of him treating her with this kind of possessive tenderness.

Serena Hart had loved him for years and received nothing in return.

Yet here she was—Evelyn Carter—getting everything she'd ever wanted in just two short months.
###Chapter 198

All eyes followed Daniel as he carried Evelyn through the grand lobby and into the private elevator, ascending to the executive floor.

Evelyn's feet touched the marble floor, yet everything felt distorted. Like walking through a nightmare wearing someone else's skin.

In dreams, Daniel Blackwood carried Evelyn Carter. In reality, he carried this imposter wearing her face.

"Need a moment to collect yourself?"

His icy voice snapped her back. She met his steel-gray eyes, colder than winter frost.

She forced a laugh. "Just surprised at the production value. For a fake relationship, you're certainly committing to the role."

Daniel's expression darkened. Every move was calculated.

This spectacle served one purpose - to lure the real Evelyn back. He'd studied her digital footprints obsessively after she vanished. Knew she craved the spotlight, adored public displays of affection.

Today's performance was engineered for maximum visibility. Photographers had been strategically placed. The images would flood international social media within hours. She'd see them. She had to.

He straightened his tie. "Remember this - no matter how convincing the act, our arrangement remains transactional."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Crystal clear."

Was anything about Daniel genuine anymore?

"Return to your department." He turned toward his desk. "You'll face questions. Prepared with answers?"

"Naturally."

The design studio fell silent when Evelyn reentered. Whispers died mid-sentence. Penelope's sharp cough scattered the gawkers.

One bold colleague approached. "Evelyn...what exactly is happening between you and Mr. Blackwood?"

Evelyn organized her workstation with deliberate movements. "You saw the show. He carried me through headquarters. Draw your own conclusions."

"But..." The woman hesitated. "Everyone knows he's still obsessed with his late wife. Aren't you worried...you're just a stand-in?"

The entire department leaned in, holding collective breath.

Evelyn shrugged. "Labels don't concern me."

"How tragic," another designer sighed. "Being someone's shadow? Not worth it."

A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Funny. Yesterday you were fawning over Audrey Sinclair, claiming she'd replace Evelyn Carter because they looked alike. Why is it glamorous for her, but pitiful for me?"
###Chapter 199

Evelyn's sharp words cut through the tense air in the design department like a knife. Her coworkers' faces twisted in displeasure, their expressions turning sour.

Just yesterday, she'd witnessed them fawning over Audrey Sinclair alongside Cassandra Montgomery. Of course they would - Audrey was the Design Director's protégé, their relationship practically glued together with favoritism.

Evelyn was the unknown variable here. No one knew where she came from or what connections she had. That made her dangerous in their eyes.

"Who knew someone could take pride in being a replacement?" Cassandra leaned against her office doorway, shooting Evelyn a look dripping with condescension. "No wonder you're so bold. Must be nice having the backing of someone untouchable."

"So you admit you can't touch him either?" Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Besides, Daniel never once called me a replacement, did he? What if I told you Daniel actually prefers me?"

"Lies!" One of the junior designers jabbed an accusing finger at Evelyn. "President Blackwood's love for his ex-wife was real! He adored her. She's the only one who ever held his heart!"

Evelyn couldn't help but burst into laughter at the absurdity.

Daniel Blackwood adored Evelyn Carter? That she was the only one in his heart?

Evelyn, the very woman in question, found the notion utterly ridiculous.

She tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear with deliberate calm. "And how exactly would you know his feelings were genuine? She's been gone six years, and he's been engaged to her sister Serena Hart for five. Or have you all conveniently forgotten that?" Her fingers straightened a stack of papers on her desk with unnecessary precision. "He claimed it was to 'take care' of his ex-wife's sister, didn't he?"

Evelyn's voice turned icy as she continued, "There are countless ways to care for someone that don't involve an engagement. That whole charade was just to maintain his image as the devoted widower."

"Is that so?" A dangerously smooth voice sliced through the department's entrance.

That familiar baritone cut through the murmuring crowd and struck Evelyn's ears like a physical blow. Her spine stiffened instantly.

She'd known better than to voice those thoughts aloud. But hearing her colleagues repeatedly wax poetic about Daniel's undying love for his ex-wife had grated on her nerves. The lies had piled up until she couldn't take it anymore.

Now Daniel had heard every word.

The department plunged into a silence so thick you could hear a pin drop.

Evelyn swallowed hard and met Daniel's stormy gaze. "Hello, President Blackwood," she managed, giving a weak wave.

The murderous glint in his eyes could have cut glass. Daniel advanced toward her, his measured steps belying the fury simmering beneath his controlled expression.

"Because I didn't tell you I'd carry you to work this morning, you're so angry you'd claim I ever had feelings for Serena Hart?" His tone was deceptively gentle, his eyes soft - the perfect picture of a boyfriend placating his upset girlfriend.

Only Evelyn could see the tempest brewing beneath that calm facade.

She offered a tentative smile. "I'm... not that upset anymore."

"I came to invite you to lunch." Daniel's expression remained neutral, but that silky voice carried an undercurrent of warning. "But since you're still clearly upset, why don't we continue this discussion in my office? I'll make it up to you."

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest, but Daniel moved faster.

In one fluid motion, he scooped her into his arms. "She'll be taking the morning off."
###Chapter 200

The office door crashed shut as Evelyn was shoved against it with brutal force.

Daniel's fingers tightened around her throat, his eyes dark with fury. "Who gave you the right to spread rumors about me?"

Evelyn gasped for air, her voice strained. "I only spoke the truth."

His grip tightened. "You think I proposed to Serena because I love her?"

"Then what other reason is there?" She lifted her chin defiantly. "There are countless ways to help someone. Engagement isn't necessary."

When she was abroad, she had tried to justify his actions. She had searched for excuses, hoping she was wrong—that he wasn’t involved with Serena, that he still loved her.

But reality was cruel.

He had conspired with Serena. They had plotted together—her betrayal, the staged accident, the fabricated affair.

Even worse, they had used a will to legitimize their twisted relationship.

Disgusting.

Every lie Daniel spun was despicable. Yet he still dared to claim he loved Evelyn Carter the most, that his engagement to Serena was merely out of duty.

A pathetic lie—one so many believed.

But Evelyn wasn’t fooled.

Daniel’s fingers dug deeper into her skin, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "You’re so sure Serena and I are together because of feelings? Then what about us? Does that mean I want you too?"

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "What do you think?"

His anger only proved her right.

She met his burning gaze with icy defiance. "Mr. Blackwood, if you truly have no interest in me, why choose me out of every woman in the world?"

Her words were meant to provoke him—and they did.

Daniel’s eyes darkened.

Before she could finish, his lips crashed against hers in a violent, punishing kiss.

It was rough, fueled by frustration and rage, swallowing her protests whole.

Evelyn fought, but she was no match for him.

Her resistance crumbled as his assault overwhelmed her senses, leaving her breathless and dazed.

Then—a knock at the door.

"Sir."

They froze.

"Your father is waiting downstairs."

Evelyn shoved him away.

Daniel exhaled sharply, his expression clearing as he stepped back.
###Chapter 201

Daniel Blackwood adjusted his tie with practiced ease. "Let him wait," he said coolly. "I'll be down shortly."

"Yes, sir."

As Ethan Reynolds' footsteps faded, Evelyn Carter slumped against the door, catching her breath.

When she looked up, Daniel stood before her, impeccably dressed once more.

His gaze was icy as it swept over her. "This won't happen again. You may play your games with anyone else in this company - but not with me."

He turned to leave when Evelyn suddenly blocked his path.

"Is there something else?" Daniel's brow furrowed in irritation.

"Yes." Evelyn lifted her chin. "You did promise to take me to lunch earlier in the design department, didn't you?"

Daniel's expression darkened. "For publicity photos."

Evelyn smiled - she'd guessed right.

She squared her shoulders, meeting his steely gaze. "I'd like to propose a deal, Mr. Blackwood."

"Go on."

"I underestimated this arrangement. I thought playing the occasional doting girlfriend would be enough." She deliberately ran her tongue over her kiss-swollen lips. "But after this morning... I believe I'm being shortchanged."

"So you'd blackmail me publicly if I refuse?" Daniel crossed his arms. "I misjudged you."

Evelyn had played the long game - first securing their public relationship, then using it as leverage.

She'd let him believe she wanted nothing more than his attention. Now she held all the cards - a hasty breakup would embarrass a man of Daniel's standing.

"You're more cunning than I thought."

Evelyn offered a small smile. "Don't worry, Mr. Blackwood. My demands are reasonable - well within your power to grant."

Daniel studied her carefully. "Name your terms."

Evelyn clenched her fists. "I want to see Serena Hart."

Daniel's eyes narrowed. "Why?"

"Personal reasons." She steadied her breathing. "I know you're keeping her under tight security. I won't harm her or interfere with whatever you have planned. I just need to see her - that's all."

Daniel's piercing gaze seemed to strip her bare. Evelyn looked away, unable to bear his scrutiny.

"Do we have a deal, Mr. Blackwood?"

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, Daniel spoke. "I'll allow it. But..." His voice dropped dangerously low. "Tell me why you hate her so much."
###Chapter 202

Daniel could see the venom in Evelyn's gaze when Serena's name slipped from her lips.

It was strange. Their paths had barely crossed. The only encounter had been during Evelyn's time as a maid at Silvercrest Manor.

Was this about Sophia?

But Evelyn had no real connection to the girl—just servant and master. A calculating woman like her wouldn't harbor such hatred over something so trivial.

"I'm the one offering the deal, Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn turned away, avoiding the intensity of his stare. "Your only choice is to accept or decline."

Daniel studied her near-perfect features, his brow creasing slightly.

After a beat, he gave a slow nod.

Evelyn's lips curved. She brushed past him toward the door. "Thank you. I'll join you for lunch later. And I'll comply with all your... requests this week."

"See that you do," Daniel said coldly before striding off.

Once his footsteps faded, Evelyn exhaled sharply and shut her eyes.

Hidden in her pocket—a brand-new voice recorder and a miniature camera.

If Victoria refused to believe Serena would harm Sophia, she'd make the woman confess it herself.

"Father."

Gregory Blackwood sat in the lobby sipping coffee when Daniel approached.

The older man slammed his cup down, hurling a newspaper onto the marble table with enough force to make it bounce.

Daniel glanced down.

The front page showed him carrying Evelyn into Pierce Corporation. The headline screamed: [PLAYBOY NO MORE? DANIEL BLACKWOOD'S NEW ROMANCE!]

A smirk tugged at Daniel's lips. He picked up the paper and set it aside. "And?"

"And?" Gregory's voice turned glacial. "I hired Evelyn for her skills—to tutor Sophia. Not for you to parade her around like some mistress! Do you intend to marry her next?"

Daniel's gaze sharpened. He poured himself coffee with deliberate calm. "Would that be a problem?"

"Of course it's a problem!" Gregory's silver-streaked hair trembled with rage. "Need I remind you of your engagement to Vivian Prescott? I tolerated your marriage to Evelyn Carter. I said nothing when you claimed to be waiting for Sophia's mother. But this—"

He slammed both palms on the table. "Another Evelyn? What game are you playing? Vivian has waited years for you! Evelyn Carter hasn't even returned, you never married Serena, yet you still reject Vivian? What's so special about this woman?"

Daniel leaned back, fingers drumming the tabletop. "Funny. Days ago, you praised her as gentle, talented, and perfect for Sophia. Said I'd be a fool not to hire her. Even wondered where I'd find another woman who understood my daughter so well."

His smile didn't reach his eyes. "How quickly you forget."
###Chapter 203

Gregory Blackwood's chest rose and fell rapidly. "That's not what I meant!"

He'd arranged for Evelyn Carter to work at Pierce Corporation precisely because he knew she was the renowned jewelry designer Celeste. He admired her talent!

That didn't mean he wanted her to end up with Daniel!

Vivian Prescott of the Prescott family had waited for Daniel for years. If Daniel was going to consider anyone outside the Sinclair sisters, it should be her!

The thought made Gregory's blood boil. He lifted his chin, fixing Daniel with an icy glare. "I don't care what you think. Since you've already set the precedent, you can damn well accept someone other than the Sinclair sisters. I'm going to the Prescott estate in a few days to bring Vivian to Silvercrest Manor. That's where she belongs!"

With that, Gregory stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

Daniel remained seated on the sofa, unmoved. He didn't chase after his father, nor did he argue.

Ethan Reynolds frowned. "Sir, are you really going to let your father bring Ms. Prescott here?"

Daniel stretched lazily, watching Gregory's retreating figure through the window. "Let him try. Knowing Vivian, she won't come."

Vivian was pride incarnate. She looked down on everything and everyone.

When Daniel had married Evelyn Sinclair years ago, Vivian had sneered and declared she'd wait for him to crawl back to her, begging for her hand.

Later, when Evelyn "died" and he got engaged to Serena Hart, Vivian had smirked and said she'd wait until he regretted his choice and proposed to her properly.

Years had passed, and she still held onto that arrogance, expecting him to come to her.

A woman like that would never lower herself to move into Silvercrest Manor just because Gregory demanded it.

And even if she did… it might not be a bad thing.

Gregory left Pierce Corporation fuming. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. Finally, he turned on his heel and marched straight back to the design department.

The office was unnervingly quiet when he arrived.

Evelyn had just returned from Daniel's office when Cassandra Montgomery summoned her.

"Evelyn," Cassandra said with a saccharine smile, "I know you have… special privileges now, but that's no excuse to slack off. Everyone's watching you. This is when you need to prove your worth."

She slammed a thick stack of design drafts onto the desk. "These are full of errors. Fix them. I want them back by the end of the day."

Cassandra smirked. "This is part of your job. Don't think I'm targeting you."

Evelyn almost laughed.

Who would've thought the legendary Celeste would be treated like a rookie and bullied in her own workplace? Still, it was better than sitting idle.

She carried the stack back to her desk.

Penelope Dawson's eyes widened when she saw the pile. She glanced at her own measly three drafts, then at Evelyn's mountain.

"She's obviously trying to bury you in work! How are you supposed to finish all that by today?"

Evelyn smiled. "She said by the end of the day. She didn't specify which day."

Then she glanced at Penelope's disastrous attempts at editing and sighed. She scooped up the girl's drafts and added them to her pile. "I'll handle these too."

Penelope hesitated. "I can do it—"

"The more you touch them, the worse they get." Evelyn's voice dropped to a whisper. "I thought reporters did their homework before going undercover."

Penelope stiffened. Her lips trembled. "W-what else do you know?"
###Chapter 204

What more?

Evelyn gave a composed smile. "Everything I need to know."

She casually picked up a pen and began adjusting Penelope's sketch. "I don't think you're a fan of Serena Hart."

Penelope bit her lip, hesitating before giving a stiff nod. "I'm not."

"That's odd."

Evelyn yawned, then leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a whisper only the two of them could hear. "If you're not a fan of Serena's, why are you so fixated on her? You even quit your job, took on a new identity, and came to Blackwood Group just to find her."

Penelope shut her eyes. She didn’t know how Evelyn had uncovered all this, but she knew Evelyn was Daniel’s woman. If she knew, then Daniel must too…

A wave of helplessness crashed over her, nearly suffocating.

She exhaled sharply. "Am I getting fired?"

"No." Evelyn lowered her gaze, continuing to scan the design sketches for errors. "Only I know."

She winked. "I just wanted to confirm our goals align. If they don’t… well, I might have to tell Daniel."

Penelope froze, stunned. She stared at Evelyn’s flawless face for a long moment before finding her voice again.

"I—"

"Choose your words carefully," Evelyn warned coolly. Penelope clenched her fists.

"I hate Serena Hart." She refused to lie or pretend to admire someone she despised. If she lost this job, she’d find another way.

"You’re safe." Evelyn sighed and slid the corrected sketch toward Penelope. "Can we talk after work?"

Penelope blinked in surprise. "You—"

"Evelyn!"

Before she could finish, a cold, middle-aged voice cut through the air from the entrance.

Evelyn set down her pen and looked up.

Gregory Blackwood, Daniel’s father, stormed toward her, his face twisted with fury. Without hesitation, he raised his hand and struck her.

The slap came too fast, too vicious.

Crack!

Evelyn’s head snapped to the side, her cheek instantly reddening, the imprint of his hand stark against her skin.

The pain burned. She pressed a hand to her face and leveled a frigid glare at Gregory.

"Who are you? What’s your problem?" Penelope shot up, stepping between them, arms spread protectively. "You’re not exactly young—how dare you hit someone like that?"

Gregory sneered down at Evelyn. "She deserved it!"

"Uncle, please calm down." Cassandra hurried out of her office, soothing Gregory while barking orders at the staff. "Get Uncle some tea!"

As one of Eleanor Blackwood’s distant relatives, Cassandra knew exactly who Gregory was.

She’d been thrilled when he struck Evelyn. "Successful men always attract gold-diggers. Why get so worked up? Once Daniel tires of her, he’ll toss her aside—she’ll never marry into the Blackwoods. No need for such anger."

Then she turned a haughty look on Evelyn. "What are you waiting for? Apologize to my uncle!"

"Apologize? For what?" Penelope scoffed. "He hit her, and she has to apologize?"

"Obviously," Cassandra sniffed, chin lifted. "She upset him. Shouldn’t she apologize for that?"
###Chapter 205

"You probably don't realize this, Penelope, but this is my uncle—President Blackwood's father!"

Evelyn's expression shifted instantly at Cassandra's words.

Seizing the moment, Cassandra pressed on. "My uncle is furious that a woman like Evelyn managed to ensnare the president. Wasn't that slap justified? Doesn't she owe him an apology?"

"She should..." The murmurs of agreement rippled through the room.

That man was President Blackwood's father. No one dared to cross him.

Penelope was stunned.

After a pause, she bit her lip. "I always assumed someone as powerful as President Blackwood would come from a refined, dignified family. Who knew..."

Gregory looked to be at least fifty, yet he’d slapped Evelyn simply because his son was involved with her?

"More like a brute..."

Penelope's words struck a nerve. Cassandra's eyes flashed. "Who are you calling uncultured and a brute? Penelope, this doesn’t concern you! How dare you insult President Blackwood's family!"

"His family is untouchable, but others aren’t?" Evelyn stepped forward, shielding Penelope.

Her gaze locked onto Gregory, sharp and unyielding. "Mr. Blackwood, you went to see Daniel first, didn’t you? I’m guessing you tried to reason with him, but he refused to listen. So, you came here—took your anger out on me instead."

Her voice was ice. "You couldn’t control your own son, so you settled for slapping me. How very brave of you."

Gregory’s face darkened. She’d hit the mark.

"This wouldn’t have happened if you knew your place!" Cassandra sneered. "If you hadn’t seduced Daniel, my uncle wouldn’t have had to discipline you!"

"Is that so?" Evelyn’s smile was cold.

Her eyes flicked to Audrey, who lingered near the doorway, watching the scene unfold. "If I recall correctly, she’s tried her luck with Daniel too, hasn’t she?"

Then, she turned back to Cassandra. "And you—don’t pretend you haven’t thought about him. If Mr. Blackwood slapped every woman who ever pursued Daniel, then fine, I’ll accept my punishment. But the others failed, so they got away with it. I succeeded—that’s my crime?"

Gregory’s expression soured further.

Cassandra clenched her jaw. "Regardless, you will apologize to my uncle! Or else—" She lifted her chin. "I’ll make sure your workload triples. Don’t forget, you’re just an apprentice. I can assign you every tedious task in this department."

Evelyn shrugged. "Go ahead."

"Wait." Gregory suddenly frowned, turning to Cassandra. "What did you say her position was?"

Cassandra smirked. "An apprentice. Someone with no formal training in design, who only got in because of her looks. It’s only fair she stays at the bottom."

"Ridiculous!" Gregory snapped. "You’re keeping her as an apprentice? Are you out of your mind?"

Evelyn was an internationally acclaimed jewelry designer!

And Cassandra had the audacity to claim she lacked skill?

If word got out, the Blackwood Group would become a laughingstock.

Gregory might resent Evelyn for replacing Vivian, but that was personal. Business was another matter entirely.

He fixed Cassandra with a hard stare. "You’re the Design Director, correct?"

Cassandra blinked, suddenly uneasy. "Yes, Uncle. Why?"

"Then step down." His voice was firm. "Give her your position."
###Chapter 206

Cassandra was seething. "Uncle Gregory, this has to be a joke."

Why should she surrender her Design Director title to this nobody? Gregory should be supporting her. He despised Evelyn just as much, so why wasn't he firing or demoting her? Instead, he was promoting her?

Who had lost their mind here?

"This isn't a joke." Gregory's voice was ice-cold as he stared Cassandra down. "Hand over your position."

Business was business. Personal feelings didn't matter.

Even if he fired Evelyn, it wouldn’t change her relationship with Daniel.

But the Blackwood Group would lose a world-class designer.

Besides, Gregory had personally recruited Evelyn. Taking back his word now would make him look weak.

The best solution? Keep her at Blackwood Group while ensuring she stayed far away from Daniel.

His gaze hardened as he repeated, "You refuse?"

"Of course I refuse!" Cassandra's voice cracked with panic. She stepped between Gregory and Evelyn. "Uncle, I earned this position through hard work! What has Evelyn ever done? She only got in because she’s sleeping with Daniel! She doesn’t deserve more than an assistant role!"

"Is that so?" Evelyn finally laughed, amused by Cassandra’s delusion.

"Obviously!" Cassandra scoffed. "You’re just a talentless hack riding on connections!"

If Evelyn had any real skill, Daniel wouldn’t have let her stay as an assistant.

No one with real talent would settle for less.

The fact that Evelyn accepted the assistant role proved she was worthless.

"Enough!" Gregory snapped. "If you can’t speak respectfully, don’t speak at all. Surrender your position. Evelyn is the new Design Director. You’re demoted to assistant."

Eleanor had spoiled these distant relatives rotten.

"Never!" Cassandra’s teeth clenched. She lifted her chin defiantly. "If Evelyn wants my position, fine. Let her prove she’s better. If she can design something that surpasses mine, I’ll step down willingly. If she can’t, she fixes every flawed sketch in this department!"

"And if she can?" A deep, chilling voice cut through the tension.

Cassandra froze. Slowly, she turned.

A tall figure in a black suit leaned against the doorway, his cold gaze locked onto her.

"Daniel."

Her throat tightened. After a beat, she lifted her chin. "If Evelyn wins, she takes my position."

"And you become the assistant, fixing every mistake?" Penelope chimed in.

Cassandra’s face paled. She shot Penelope a venomous glare. "Stay out of this!"

"Sounds fair to me." Evelyn shrugged. She grabbed a sketchpad and pen.

"What should I draw?"

Her eyes flicked to Daniel. "Remember the proposal I brought you yesterday? The one Cassandra revised four times and still failed? I’ll redesign it—my way."

Without waiting for a response, her pen flew across the paper.

Gregory’s interest piqued. He moved behind her, watching intently.

Cassandra and the other designers exchanged skeptical glances.
###Chapter 207

This woman was all talk!

But when Evelyn began sketching the jewelry design, her confident strokes and distinctive composition left everyone speechless.

The office fell into complete silence, broken only by the sound of her pencil gliding across paper.

All eyes were fixed on her work—including Daniel’s.

His gaze darkened as he studied her hands.

Memories of Serena Hart flashed through his mind.

Serena had loved sketching too. She would always sit by the open window, sunlight spilling over her shoulders as the breeze lifted the curtains behind her.

A sketchboard in front of her, she’d lose herself in her art, her movements effortless.

She drew everything—flowers, landscapes—but most often, she drew him.

His profile. His eyes.

Countless times, he had lingered in the shadows, just like now, watching her bring her visions to life.

He’d always slip away before she finished, never caught in the act.

Lost in her world, she never noticed him.

The way Evelyn held her pencil made Daniel’s brow furrow.

He wasn’t an artist, but could two people really sketch the same way?

Her technique, her subtle gestures—they were identical to Serena’s.

His jaw tightened. Evelyn had once admitted to mimicking Serena’s habits.

But could someone replicate something as personal as an artistic style?

Without a word, he pulled out his phone and sent Ethan a message.

[Dig deeper into Serena Hart’s social media and artwork. Leave no stone unturned.]

By the time he finished, Evelyn had completed her sketch.

What had taken Cassandra days to draft, she’d finished in barely an hour.

And her design was far more intricate.

"Brilliant," Gregory murmured, stepping closer to examine it. "No wonder you're considered a master."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Thank you."

With Gregory already aware of her identity, she saw no point in hiding it further.

Besides, her alter ego, Celeste, had little connection to Serena. She’d only concealed it to avoid unnecessary attention.

Cassandra approached, staring at the design in stunned silence.

"You—"

"You're—"

"She’s Celeste," Gregory cut in, sighing. "Now do you understand why I wanted her to take your position?"

Cassandra paled, speechless.

Gregory turned to Daniel. "She was Sophia’s mentor when she studied design abroad."

Daniel’s entire body went rigid.

Evelyn had taught Sophia?

The air turned icy.

Eyes narrowed, he strode toward Evelyn, stopping just inches away.

His voice was dangerously low. "So you’ve known Sophia all along."

Which meant she’d known Serena too.
###Chapter 208

"Yes."

Evelyn lifted her chin, her lips curling into a smirk. "Surprised, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel's expression darkened instantly.

Without warning, his hand shot out, fingers clamping around her wrist like a vise.

He was a man possessed. Dragging her behind him, he stormed out of the design department, ignoring the elevator entirely.

Up the stairs they went, his grip unrelenting, her body stumbling like a ragdoll in his wake.

By the time they reached the top floor, Evelyn was gasping, her knees buckling as she braced a hand against the wall.

"Daniel Blackwood, have you lost your mind?"

"Maybe I have!" He hauled her into his office, slamming the door shut with enough force to rattle the walls.

Evelyn's back hit the door, the impact jarring.

Daniel's eyes burned with fury as he loomed over her. "You knew Evelyn Carter, didn't you? You were Sophia's teacher overseas. She lived with Evelyn all those years. What's your connection? Did you plan this together? She sends her child back to me while you dangle every memory of her in front of my face—what game are you playing?"

His words exploded in her ears like gunfire.

Evelyn shut her eyes, a bitter laugh escaping her. "What do you think?"

That laugh—mocking, dismissive—sent a fresh wave of rage through him. They'd made a fool of him.

"Where is she?" His voice was a growl, fingers twitching as if itching to shake the answer out of her.

Evelyn opened her eyes, her gaze icy. She said nothing.

His control snapped. Hands shot to her throat, not tight enough to hurt, but enough to make his desperation clear.

"Tell me where she is. I need to see her. Now."

It didn't matter what happened in the past. He didn't care if she'd betrayed him. He just needed to see her.

"She won't see you." Evelyn's voice was steel. "Evelyn Carter despises you. You're the last person she ever wants to lay eyes on again."

"Liar."

Her words were knives, slicing through the fragile illusions he'd clung to for years.

"She loved me. More than anything."

"That was before." Evelyn's stare was merciless. "She loved you enough to defy her family. Enough to give up everything. And what did you give her in return? Pain. Despair. That love died a long time ago, Daniel. It's gone."

Every syllable was a hammer blow, crushing what little hope he had left.
###Chapter 209

"No way, that's not true!"

Daniel Blackwood's hands tightened around Evelyn Carter's throat. "You're lying!"

His grip was crushing. Evelyn's voice came out strangled. "Daniel Blackwood, you've lost your mind!"

"You're the one who's insane!" Daniel's eyes burned with fury. "How else could you say something like that?"

Knock. Knock.

Just as Evelyn was on the verge of losing consciousness, sharp raps sounded at the door.

Bang!

The office door flew open.

Standing in the doorway were Tyler Walsh and Dominic Shaw. Behind them, Liam and Emily Carter watched with wide eyes.

The moment the door opened, Evelyn wrenched herself free from Daniel's grasp. She collapsed to the floor, gasping for air, her fingers pressing against her bruised throat.

The commotion snapped Daniel out of his rage.

He stood frozen, staring at Evelyn, then at the children. For the first time, he felt utterly powerless. He didn't know what to do.

"Auntie!"

Emily rushed forward, throwing herself into Evelyn's arms. "Are you okay?"

"Dad, have you completely lost it?" Liam's voice was sharp.

"He definitely has."

Liam strode into the office, his small hands clasped behind his back. His expression was far too serious for a child. "He got angry because his lies were exposed. Mr. Blackwood, I never realized you were the type to run from the truth."

Daniel's jaw tightened. He studied Liam coolly. "What do children know about any of this?"

"We know plenty."

Liam settled onto the sofa, crossing his short legs. "When I was overseas, I found out everything. Auntie Evelyn never liked you. That's why she brought my mom back—to take care of Emily and see if you were even fit to raise her."

He lifted his gaze, his big eyes unflinching. "But it looks like you have a violent streak, Mr. Blackwood. You're not qualified to raise a child alone."

Daniel's eyes narrowed. "What else do you know?"

"Enough." Liam glanced at Evelyn, relieved to see color returning to her face. "I also know you broke her heart before. She really loved you, but all you gave her was indifference and betrayal."

Daniel scoffed. "When did I ever betray her?"

Cold, distant, heartless—he'd admit to that.

When he married Evelyn Carter, he'd convinced himself it was only because she was a good woman. He told himself he'd never actually love her.

But when he lost her, he realized the most important woman in his life had already come—and gone.

"Never?" Evelyn's voice was hoarse. She glared at him from the floor, still clutching her throat. "Then explain your relationship with Serena Hart."

Serena?

Daniel's expression darkened. "I've told you before. I gave Serena a proper status so I could take care of her after you left. She's your closest sister. Was I supposed to abandon her?"

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

"There are countless ways to take care of someone. Why did it have to be an engagement?" Her eyes turned icy. "And that child Serena had back then—wasn't it yours?"
###Chapter 210

"Serena's child?"

Daniel's brows knitted tightly. "Since when did she have a child?"

"Daniel, why keep pretending at this point?" Evelyn stared at his feigned innocence, her gaze turning icy. "If it weren't for Serena's pregnancy, Evelyn would never have left you."

Watching Evelyn spin such absurdity, Daniel found it laughable.

"So you're saying not only was Serena pregnant, but she also carried my child? And that's why Evelyn chose to leave me?"

"Isn't it obvious?"

Evelyn saw the derision in Daniel's eyes, and it felt like a knife twisting in her chest.

How could he still play the clueless victim?

Back then, she and Serena had been pregnant at the same time. To please Serena, he had orchestrated an "accident" to eliminate her.

They’d even forged a will to tarnish her reputation posthumously, accusing her of infidelity.

Now, she had laid everything bare—yet he still dared to act ignorant!

Daniel let out a bitter laugh. "If Serena really bore my child, where is it now?"

His mocking tone only fueled Evelyn’s fury.

She clenched her jaw.

Did he think she had no proof?

Two months after the accident, Serena had undergone a procedure at Grandview Medical Center. Did he truly believe she didn’t know?

Daniel sneered. "Are you suggesting the child was terminated?"

Evelyn remained silent.

"What an imaginative mind you have."

He glanced at his watch, his expression darkening. "It's lunchtime. Let's go."

Liam, perched on the sofa, frowned. His young voice dripped with disdain. "After all this, you still want to drag my mom into your little charade?"

"The press is waiting. What do you think?"

Daniel’s sharp glance at Liam was more for Evelyn’s benefit.

"If we're acting, we might as well commit."

Then, his gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, are you regretting our agreement this morning?"

Her pulse spiked. This man was insane.

Even if he truly didn’t know, why insist on this farce? She was posing as Evelyn Carter’s friend—why involve her?

He claimed to have loved Evelyn Carter, crafting the image of a devoted husband.

But his motives were never pure.

Demanding she play his girlfriend wasn’t about making Evelyn jealous.

A sardonic smile touched her lips. "I’ll honor my word. But Mr. Blackwood, don’t forget your promises."

Daniel’s smile was flat. "Naturally."

He needed answers about Serena’s supposed pregnancy.

Evelyn refused to expose Liam and Sophia to the media, so the children stayed behind, picking at their lunch in Daniel’s office.

"Do you think Dad suspects Mom’s real identity?" Sophia whispered, biting her lip.

Liam shrugged. "Given that scumbag’s IQ? Doubtful. But they say love makes fools of men. He’s clearly fallen out of love—yet still an idiot."

Sophia pouted. "Badmouthing Dad in his own office? Aren’t you afraid someone will hear?"
###Chapter 211

"Not happening."

Liam glanced up at the two towering figures by the entrance. "Aren't you two joining us for lunch?"

"Don't mind us, Boss." Dominic flashed a mischievous grin. "You enjoy your meal with little princess Emily first."

Tyler nodded in agreement. "We'll make sure no one eavesdrops on your private conversation."

"See?" Liam smirked at Sophia with satisfaction. "Some people still appreciate me."

Sophia merely pouted in response.

After a long pause, she let out a small sigh. "I really miss Oliver..."

Liam's hand froze mid-air, the spoon hovering over his plate.

Oliver...

"We'll figure something out," Liam finally said, his voice heavy with emotion.

Meanwhile at Pierce Corporation, Daniel had arranged lunch in the company cafeteria.

When he led Evelyn inside by the hand, she found the situation utterly surreal.

She'd expected something more romantic - perhaps an intimate bistro downstairs.

The corporate cafeteria... This was the fantasy of her teenage self. Public displays of affection, making other women jealous. She'd even blogged about such scenarios years ago.

Now, as a mother of three six-year-olds, walking hand-in-hand with Daniel under everyone's scrutiny felt... awkward.

Back when they should have been love-struck teenagers, they'd been locked in a cold war. Now, when they should have moved on, her youthful fantasies were being fulfilled in the strangest way.

Was this irony or fate?

Before she could ponder further, Daniel guided her to a reserved table.

The CEO's lunch proved surprisingly modest - just a standard four-course meal.

Releasing her hand, Daniel pulled out her chair with old-fashioned courtesy before seating himself opposite her.

They picked up their utensils simultaneously.

The meal progressed in complete silence.

The tension was palpable.

Nearby reporters exchanged confused glances. Just this morning, the couple had appeared deeply in love. What had changed?

Perhaps sensing their bewilderment, Daniel suddenly reached across to place some food on Evelyn's plate.

She frowned slightly but ate it without comment.

Following his lead, she mechanically transferred some of her own food to his plate.

The entire exchange felt painfully staged.

Finally, the reporters sent a brave representative forward.

"Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Carter," the reporter began hesitantly. "Could you share how you two fell in love?"

"Love at first sight." Their voices blended perfectly.

The synchronized response startled them both. Their eyes met in genuine surprise.
###Chapter 212

"It does appear to be love at first sight..." The reporter adjusted his collar nervously. "So who made the first move?"

Daniel studied Evelyn's face. He opened his mouth to speak, but she beat him to it.

Her lips curved into a confident smile as she faced the camera. "I chased him first. But when I pursued Daniel, his wealth meant nothing to me. Not his status, not his family name. Only the man beneath it all." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I would've given up everything for even a sliver of hope. Fought the whole world if I had to. Let them call me a gold-digger. Let my family disown me. None of it mattered as long as he looked at me just once."

Daniel's jaw tightened.

The way the light caught Evelyn's profile suddenly reminded him of Serena Hart.

Serena had made those same impossible choices for him years ago.

She'd left behind her entire life in Mariner's Cove - parents, friends, career - to follow him to Willowbrook.

Endured his family's scorn. His own emotional neglect. All without complaint.

He'd been such a cold bastard back then.

"Ahem." The reporter coughed awkwardly. "You're making Mr. Blackwood sound rather...villainous. This is supposed to be a romantic interview."

Evelyn blinked, snapping out of her reverie. Daniel too.

"Let me take this one." Daniel's baritone voice filled the room. "She's not wrong. I was a villain."

His gaze locked onto Evelyn with startling intensity. "I took her love for granted. Dismissed her sacrifices. Thought buying expensive gifts made me a good husband when I couldn't even give her basic kindness."

But it wasn't Evelyn he saw anymore. In her place stood Serena - the real Serena - with tears streaming down her face.

His voice cracked. "Only after losing her did I realize...she was my entire world. But I don't deserve her forgiveness."

The raw pain in his words made Evelyn turn away abruptly.

Her vision blurred. This was all an act, she reminded herself. Daniel hadn't changed. He was still the same master manipulator.

Yet even knowing this, her chest ached. Because once, she'd loved this man enough to destroy herself for him.

"Ms. Carter," the reporter offered tissues gently, "Mr. Blackwood clearly regrets everything. Give him another chance?"

When Evelyn composed herself, the reporter exhaled sharply. "Well! That was...intense. Final question - how long have you two been officially together?"

Daniel answered flatly. "Twenty-four hours."

The reporters' jaws dropped.

All that drama...for a one-day relationship?
###Chapter 213

The reporters left in stunned silence.

Once they were gone, Daniel turned his icy gaze on Evelyn. He tossed the tissue beside him toward her. "Impressive performance."

His words made her tears feel like a pathetic joke. She caught the tissue and wiped her face dry. "Yours was just as convincing, Mr. Blackwood," she shot back, voice dripping with sarcasm.

"I wasn't acting." His dark eyes bore into hers. "For a moment, I saw you as Evelyn Carter."

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh. "So everything you said just now was sincere?"

She didn't believe a word of it.

Daniel seemed to read her thoughts. He straightened, his expression unreadable. "Believe what you want."

Then he turned and strode away, leaving her still seated.

After a few steps, he paused. "Are you coming, or do you not want to visit the asylum?"

Evelyn hesitated before jumping to her feet. "We're going now?"

"Is there a better time?"

He didn’t look back, his tone indifferent. "Since you're her friend..."

Whatever Evelyn wanted, he would facilitate it—even seeing Serena.

Before heading to Willowbrook Asylum, Evelyn made a quick detour to the office. She had taken off her jacket earlier because of the heat, but her recording device was still tucked inside the pocket.

When she entered, Penelope was at her desk, fiddling with something.

At the sight of Evelyn, Penelope stiffened, then forced a smile. She set down Evelyn’s sketch.

"An overseas jewelry design master. You really are different from the rest."

"I just sketch more, that’s all."

Evelyn gave a tight smile, grabbed her jacket, and turned to leave.

Penelope frowned. "Where are you going?"

"To see an old friend."

With that, Evelyn took a deep breath and walked out.

Penelope watched until Evelyn disappeared from view. Only then did she exhale in relief.

She turned back to her computer and discreetly opened a tracking program. A red dot pulsed steadily on the map.

Penelope smirked. Since Evelyn had connections to Daniel, she was bound to lead her to Serena eventually.

The black Maserati pulled up outside Willowbrook Asylum in the western district.

Evelyn stepped out, her eyes landing on the stark sign: [Mental Asylum].

"I never thought you'd actually lock her up in a place like this."

Daniel was the most ruthless man she'd ever met.

Years ago, he'd orchestrated an accident to kill her just to please Serena.

Now, afraid Serena would drag him down, he'd tossed her into an asylum.

Who wouldn’t fear that kind of cold-blooded calculation?

"I'm just keeping her somewhere safe for now."

After all, Serena had nearly gotten Emily killed multiple times.

That wasn’t something he could overlook.

He needed a secure, isolated place to hold her until Evelyn Carter returned to deal with her personally.

Evelyn scoffed. "How touching. Even after she tried to murder your daughter, you're still looking out for her."

Daniel met her gaze evenly. "No need to be so dramatic. She’s still Evelyn Carter’s sister."
###Chapter 214

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

Sister?

What kind of sister gets pregnant with her own sister's husband's child and then has her brother-in-law murder his wife?

What kind of sister repeatedly tries to kill her own sister's daughter?

Sometimes Evelyn questioned whether Serena was truly their parents' child.

They'd grown up together, received the same upbringing - how could Serena be so fundamentally different?

"Right this way." Willowbrook Asylum had received Daniel's generous payment, ensuring Serena remained under 24/7 surveillance.

The staff greeted them warmly upon arrival.

"Ms. Hart is inside."

An attendant led Daniel and Evelyn down the corridor, stopping at the final door. "The room is completely soundproof. For safety reasons, we've restrained her with chains. You may enter without concern."

"Thank you." Evelyn glanced at Daniel. "I'd like to go in alone. I trust you won't eavesdrop, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel's icy gaze flickered over her. "I have no interest in such childish behavior."

He turned sharply and strode to a bench further down the hallway, pulling out his phone to work.

Assured of privacy, Evelyn took a steadying breath and pushed open the door.

The sparse room contained only a bed, table, and two chairs.

Serena sat hunched on the bed, her hospital gown wrinkled, hair disheveled, limbs secured by thick chains.

Evelyn paused at the threshold, calculating the safe distance before approaching.

At the sound of footsteps, Serena's head snapped up.

Hatred burned in her eyes the moment she recognized Evelyn. "You."

"Me." Evelyn's hand slipped into her pocket, activating the recorder.

She took the seat opposite her sister. "Surprised?"

"Should I be?" Serena's lips twisted into a sneer. "Here to gloat about your victory?"

"Among other things." Evelyn crossed her legs, her smile razor-sharp. "Have you seen today's headlines? No? Let me enlighten you. Daniel and I are officially together."

Serena's teeth sank into her lower lip hard enough to draw blood.

Finally she spat out, "I always knew you were scheming. You never went to Silvercrest Manor to be a maid. Protecting that brat was just your way into Daniel's bed, wasn't it?"

"Absolutely."

Evelyn leaned forward, eyes gleaming with triumph. "The irony? If you'd shown Sophia even a fraction of real motherly love, you might still be Mrs. Blackwood."

Serena's bitter laugh echoed off the padded walls.

"Expect me to love that little bastard? I'd rather die!"

"Why?"
###Chapter 215

Evelyn leaned her cheek against her palm. A faint smile played on her lips as she asked, "Isn't Sophia your sister's daughter? Why did you deliberately try to kill her on the Skywheel? Was setting our house on fire really necessary too?"

Serena's gaze flickered to the closed door.

She smirked.

"The soundproofing here is excellent. I know." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Let me be honest with you. I could love any woman's child as my own. I could even pretend to care—except for Evelyn Carter's. I just can't."

Seeing Serena finally reveal her true self, Evelyn's chest tightened.

She scoffed. "Why? Did Evelyn Carter ever treat you poorly?"

"No. Her crime was being too perfect."

Serena's glare burned through Evelyn, as if staring at something far beyond. Madness flickered in her eyes. "I grew up in Evelyn's shadow. Everyone kept telling me what an incredible sister I had, how I should be more like her. Every mistake I made was compared to her. I was never good enough—never worthy of being her sister."

A bitter laugh escaped Serena. "I was sick of it. So I took her man. And then I tried to kill her. If she hadn't been so damn lucky, she would've died six years ago!"

Her voice turned venomous. "But no. She survived. And then she sent that little brat back to Daniel! She’s taunting me. Challenging me. That’s why I have to kill Sophia. I have to!"

The years in Willowbrook Asylum had left their mark. Serena’s words dripped with unchecked rage, her expression twisted with hatred.

Evelyn’s smile turned cold. "So, because of your jealousy, you destroyed Evelyn and tried to murder an innocent child?"

Serena said nothing.

"Pathetic." Evelyn flicked off the recorder hidden in her pocket. She rose gracefully, towering over Serena’s disheveled form. "This is karma. You made Evelyn suffer. You tried to kill her daughter. That’s why you lost your own child."

With that, she turned and walked away.

Serena froze.

Child?

She had never been pregnant.

Unless—

Her breath hitched.

Evelyn Carter.

Back then, when Evelyn married Daniel, the Blackwood family pressured her to find a cure for her condition so she could bear an heir.

That was why, when Serena framed Evelyn, she had lied to Daniel about being pregnant. She never imagined Evelyn actually was.

She had only told one person about that lie.

Serena’s blood ran cold as she watched Evelyn leave.

No wonder she protected Sophia so fiercely. No wonder she was always so cautious. No wonder she believed Daniel still loved her.

How had she never realized?

Evelyn Carter was standing right in front of her.
###Chapter 216

Evelyn stepped out of the room to find Daniel still seated, scrolling through documents on his phone.

At the sound of the door opening, he slipped his phone into his pocket and rose smoothly. "Done?"

She smirked. "Mr. Blackwood, care to have a little chat with your ex-fiancée?"

His brow twitched at the term, but then he smiled. "Naturally."

His gaze drifted to the sunlight streaming through the window. "Wait for me in the car. This won't take long."

Evelyn shrugged and walked away without another word.

She didn’t care what Daniel had to say to Serena. Nor did she care how long he took.

Her fingers curled around the recording device in her pocket. She had what she needed from Serena.

Originally, she’d planned to gather more evidence with Liam before handing everything over to the police.

Serena wouldn’t have escaped a murder conspiracy charge.

But seeing her now—chained, disheveled, barely recognizable—Evelyn realized it wasn’t necessary.

She’d always assumed Daniel wouldn’t be this ruthless. After all, Serena was once the woman he loved.

Turns out, he was far colder than she’d imagined.

If Serena was already living in her own personal prison, why bother sending her to a real one?

With that thought, Evelyn exhaled and climbed into the car.

Ethan lounged in the passenger seat, scrolling through his phone. He glanced up when the door opened, then resumed his indifferent slouch. "How long will Mr. Blackwood be?"

Evelyn tapped out a message to Victoria. "No idea."

"You’re awfully generous," Ethan mused, stretching his legs. "You know Serena and Daniel used to be engaged. Doesn’t it bother you, leaving them alone? What if old feelings resurface?"

She didn’t look up from her phone. "And?"

"You don’t care?"

"Should I?"

Ethan frowned, studying her. "But I could’ve sworn you liked him. Secretly."

Her fingers stilled mid-text.

Then she laughed softly. "You’re imagining things."

Even if she had liked Daniel, that was six years ago.

Now, she barely had the energy to hate him, let alone love him.

Her phone buzzed.

Victoria’s reply: [See you at the old place tonight.]

Evelyn’s brow furrowed. [Okay.]

Liam and her things had already been moved to Silvercrest Manor. Meeting at their old apartment was smart—she could claim she needed to retrieve something.

A far more believable excuse than random shopping. Daniel wouldn’t question it.

Inside the asylum room, Serena sat slumped in her chair, hair tangled, staring blankly at the man before her.

She had loved him for years.
###Chapter 217

If it weren't for Evelyn Carter, she would have been his wife!

Back then, Evelyn stole that position from her.

Now, Evelyn was impersonating someone else, stealing from her all over again.

Evelyn deserved to die.

"I had my people investigate you."

Daniel Blackwood studied Serena Hart's face. "Right after Evelyn's death, you underwent a procedure at the OB-GYN department. It's been too long—we can't access the records now."

His gaze turned icy. "Tell me, what was the operation for?"

Serena narrowed her eyes.

No doubt, Evelyn must have told him about this.

She smirked. Clearly, Evelyn was still hiding behind another identity—otherwise, Daniel wouldn’t be reacting like this.

With that thought, Serena smiled. "Daniel, do you really want the truth?"

Daniel’s eyes darkened, but he remained silent.

Serena let out a bitter laugh. "Yes, I went to the OB-GYN. I had my hymen restored."

His expression hardened. "Is that so?"

"Of course."

She tilted her head, her voice dripping with mockery. "Don’t believe me? Would you like to verify it yourself?"

Daniel’s jaw tightened at her taunting tone. "You didn’t have an abortion?"

"I was never pregnant. Why would I need one?"

Serena smoothed her hair, her lips curling in disdain. "Before Evelyn’s accident, I had my share of lovers. I lost my virginity long ago. But after she died, when you agreed to be my fiancé out of obligation, I had it repaired—just in case you ever decided to take me to bed."

She let out a hollow laugh. "Funny, isn’t it? That useless membrane has been sitting inside me for six years now. Untouched."

A vein pulsed at Daniel’s temple.

All these years, he had treated her like a sister—Evelyn’s sister, his family.

He had never once looked at her with anything but protective concern.

Yet she had been scheming to seduce him for half a decade.

His voice turned lethal. "I made it clear—I’m your brother-in-law. I will never sleep with you."

Serena’s smile was chilling. "Says who?"

She met his gaze, unnervingly calm. "When you married Evelyn, you swore you’d never love her. But you did. After she died, you vowed you’d never love again. Yet here you are, obsessed with that pretty little imposter."

Her lips twisted. "If you can break your word for them, why not for me?"

Her eyes burned with madness. "I’ve stood by you all these years. Why can’t you see me? You claim Evelyn Carter is the only one in your heart, but your eyes betray you. You want her, don’t you? If you can want her, why not me? I wouldn’t even mind sharing."
###Chapter 218

"Daniel, I've loved you for years! Longer than Evelyn ever did!"

Serena stared at Daniel with desperate hunger, like a starved animal eyeing its last meal.

Her gaze burned with madness, greed, and restless impatience.

She leaned closer, her voice trembling. "If you could fall for Evelyn, why not me? You're already betraying her. What difference does one more betrayal make?"

Her hands twitched, the chains around her clanking violently.

Daniel's expression darkened.

"This place suits you perfectly."

He stood, his eyes cold as ice. "But let me make three things clear. One—Evelyn Carter isn't dead. Two—I'll wait for her. And you will too. And lastly..."

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I have never betrayed Evelyn."

He had felt something for her, yes—but only because she reminded him of Evelyn. That was all.

"Before, I treated you with kindness because I thought you were the sister she loved most. I indulged you. But I never realized what was festering inside that twisted mind of yours."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "If I'd known, I would've locked you in here much sooner."

He turned to leave.

"Then swear it!" Serena shrieked. "If you still love Evelyn, swear you'll never love her impostor! Swear it to me!"

Daniel paused.

He didn't look back. Only let out a dark chuckle.

"Why would I swear anything to a lunatic?"

The door slammed shut behind him.

Serena sat frozen, staring at the metal bars.

Then, with a sudden burst of fury, she kicked the table over.

No. She couldn't stay here. Not now.

Because Evelyn was alive.

If she stayed, the truth would come out. And if Evelyn and Daniel reunited—everything would be exposed.

Her nails dug into her palms. She had to escape.

Outside the asylum, Ethan waited in the driver's seat of the Maserati, eyes closed. In the backseat, Evelyn scrolled through news on her phone.

When Daniel slid into the car, she glanced up.

"Done with your ex-fiancée?"

"Yes." His voice was flat. "Ethan, drive."

The engine roared to life.

Evelyn turned to the window, watching the asylum shrink in the distance.

After a long silence, Daniel spoke.

"Serena was never pregnant."

She stiffened, turning to him.

His jaw was tight, gaze fixed ahead. "She didn't have an abortion. The hospital records were faked."

He couldn't bring himself to say the rest—that Serena had undergone surgery just to trick him into bed.

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile.

"That's all you got from that long conversation?"

Daniel closed his eyes, exhaustion lining his face.

"Tell Evelyn Carter this—Serena never carried my child. Nothing ever happened between us."

He still didn't understand why Evelyn blamed him for it.
###Chapter 219

If these misunderstandings came from Evelyn Carter, Daniel Blackwood had to set the record straight.

Right now, he couldn’t reach her directly. His only option was to relay the message through Luna.

Luna scoffed. "You really think she’ll believe you?"

Daniel smirked. "If she doesn’t, she’s welcome to confront me about it."

Luna instantly clamped her mouth shut.

After a beat, she sneered, "Fine. I’ll tell her."

Daniel was so confident Evelyn wouldn’t show her face—that’s why he dared to be this bold.

Confront him? If she ever stepped forward as Evelyn Carter again, she might not survive the encounter.

The car fell into heavy silence.

Soon, they arrived at Silvercrest Manor.

The moment the car stopped, Daniel threw open the door and strode out.

Luna sighed and followed.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The second she stepped inside, the mansion’s security system erupted in a deafening alarm.

Daniel’s eyes narrowed. He turned to glare at her.

Luna froze, bewildered. She instinctively took a step back—and the alarm stopped.

Then she stepped forward again.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

"What are you carrying?" Daniel demanded, stepping closer. "This system detects tracking devices. Do you have one on you?"

Luna shook her head. "No?"

The alarm continued blaring.

"Take your jacket off," Daniel ordered, voice sharp.

Luna pressed her lips together but obeyed, shrugging out of her coat.

Daniel snatched it from her and flung it across the room.

Silence.

Ethan Reynolds immediately retrieved the jacket and inspected it. His fingers found a tiny black chip sewn into the label.

"Tracking device," he confirmed, crushing it between his fingers. "Luna, who had access to this?"

Luna’s mind raced—then landed on Penelope Dawson’s nervous face.

She smacked her forehead. "Her!"

Earlier, when she’d grabbed her jacket from the design department, Penelope had been hovering over her sketches.

Luna had assumed she was just curious.

She never imagined Penelope would plant something on her.

"Someone from the office?" Daniel’s jaw tightened. He grabbed Luna’s arm and hauled her back to the car. "Ethan, drive. Now."

Ethan didn’t hesitate.

By the time they reached the office, Penelope was already gone.

"Sick leave," a coworker said. "But when I was seeing a client out, I spotted her boarding the number two bus."

They frowned. "Weird. She never takes that route."

Luna’s blood ran cold.

The number two bus’s final stop?

Willowbrook Asylum—where Serena Hart was locked away.

Penelope had used her to locate Serena.

What the hell was she planning?
###Chapter 220

The sleek black Maserati screeched to a halt outside Willowbrook Asylum once again.

Evelyn Carter practically leaped from the vehicle, her heart pounding as she sprinted through the asylum's entrance.

Something was wrong.

The elevator from the top floor wasn’t moving.

Gritting her teeth, Evelyn bypassed it entirely and took the stairs instead.

Serena Hart’s room was on the eighth floor.

By the time Evelyn reached the top, her lungs burned, her legs trembled, and she had to brace herself against the wall just to keep standing.

She barely managed two steps before the elevator doors slid open.

A tall, impeccably dressed man stepped out, his expression unreadable.

Daniel Blackwood.

"You're going the wrong way," he said coolly, then turned and walked in the opposite direction without another word.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, forcing her exhausted body to follow.

Daniel led her straight to the office of Serena’s attending physician.

The doctor frowned upon seeing them. "Back so soon?"

"Did a young woman visit Serena Hart today?" Evelyn demanded.

The doctor nodded. "Yes. She claimed to be from Mr. Blackwood’s company. Showed me a photo of you two together. Said you’d forgotten to ask Serena something and sent her in your place."

He scratched his head, confused. "She just left. Did you forget something else?"

Evelyn wanted to scream.

She’d been careless.

From the intel Oliver had given her, she knew Penelope Dawson despised Serena. But she hadn’t anticipated this.

Penelope had played her.

Hands shaking, Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed Penelope’s number.

No answer.

Again.

And again.

Nothing.

While Evelyn seethed, Daniel remained eerily composed.

"How long was she here?" he asked the doctor. "How much time did she spend with Serena?"

The doctor hesitated. "I… don’t recall exactly. Let me check the surveillance."

He led them to the asylum’s security room.

The footage showed the hospital corridors, timestamped.

"Eighteen minutes," the doctor confirmed.

Daniel’s gaze darkened as he studied the woman on screen.

Long hair. Oversized black-framed glasses. A face deliberately obscured.

"Pull up footage of her entering and exiting," Daniel ordered.

The staff scrambled to comply.

Within moments, the screens displayed multiple angles—hallways, the main entrance.

Daniel’s jaw tightened.

"The gait is different."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

"Different?" she echoed. "You mean… they switched places?"

Daniel didn’t answer. Instead, he pulled out his phone.

"Ethan," he said tersely, "lock down all airports and major transit points. Track every exit route from Willowbrook."

Evelyn’s mind reeled.

Penelope’s words echoed in her skull: I hate Serena.

She clenched her fists.

"Give me the key to Serena’s room," she demanded.

She had to see for herself.

Two minutes later, Evelyn stood outside the door, key in hand.
###Chapter 221

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she turned the key in the lock.

The door creaked open to reveal an unsettling silence.

Sunlight streamed through the high window, casting a solitary beam across the sterile floor.

In the far corner sat a figure in a hospital gown, knees drawn to chest, tangled hair obscuring her face. The complete stillness made her seem more like a shadow than a person.

Evelyn's heart sank.

This wasn't Serena. The real Serena would never sit so quietly, so broken.

"Penelope." The name tasted bitter on Evelyn's tongue.

The figure flinched. Slowly, painfully, she raised her head.

Beneath the matted hair was Penelope's face - bare for the first time without her signature glasses.

"So you figured it out." Penelope's laugh held no humor. "I thought I'd last longer than this."

Less than an hour. That's all it took for her deception to unravel.

Evelyn's chest constricted at the sight of Penelope's calm acceptance. She'd trusted this girl completely.

From the moment Penelope joined Blackwood Corporation, she'd played the perfect role - sweet, earnest, unassuming. Exactly the kind of bright young talent Evelyn admired.

And it had all been a lie.

Evelyn dropped into the chair, her gaze turning icy. "You claimed to despise Serena. What changed? Did hatred turn to devotion? Is that why you're sacrificing yourself for her?"

Penelope shook her head. "I still hate her." A strange serenity settled over her features. "But I have my reasons."

"What could possibly justify this?" Evelyn's voice cracked.

"Don't look at me like that." Penelope worked free the restraints with practiced ease and moved to sit across from Evelyn.

"I had a brother. Not by blood." Her fingers traced patterns on the table. "A truck driver. He gave up everything so I could have an education. Worked himself to the bone for me."

A wistful smile touched her lips. "We promised to marry when we grew up. Then..."

Her eyes met Evelyn's. "He vanished. His last job? Delivering something for Serena across Harborview Bridge during a storm."

Storm.

Truck.

Harborview Bridge.

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Suddenly she was back on that rain-slicked bridge, staring into the face of the driver who'd tried to kill her.

"Your brother," Evelyn whispered. "Did he have a mole here?" She touched the left side of her nose.

Penelope went rigid. "You knew him?"

The truth hit Evelyn like a physical blow.

When she finally spoke, her voice was steel. "What did Serena offer you?"

Penelope's lower lip trembled.

"She promised to help me find him."
###Chapter 222

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile. "You actually believe her?"

"Not entirely, but..."

Penelope lowered her gaze. "She took my phone and dialed my brother's current number. I heard his voice. It was him."

"Serena told me that when my brother was delivering a shipment for her, he got into an accident. Facing legal consequences, he took the money and fled. He's living comfortably overseas now, but he's afraid of being tricked into returning and facing punishment. So, other than Serena, he won't trust anyone else."

Tears spilled from Penelope's eyes.

She choked back a sob. "I've missed him so much. All these years, as an investigative journalist, I've exhausted every lead to find him. When I couldn't, I targeted Serena. I wrote every damaging article I could. But now that I've heard his voice—now that I know he's alive—"

"So, you were willing to trade your freedom for Serena's?"

Evelyn watched Penelope cry, then scoffed. "Pathetic."

Penelope shut her eyes. "Call me whatever you want. You only married Daniel for money. You wouldn't understand what real love feels like!"

"I don't understand love?" Evelyn suddenly laughed, sharp and humorless. "No one has loved as desperately as I have. Fine, maybe I don't know much about healthy relationships. But I do know this—if your brother truly cared about you, you wouldn’t have to fight so hard just to hear his voice."

"He's alive, yet he hasn’t reached out in years. Isn’t that answer enough? Stop deluding yourself."

Each word struck like a hammer, crushing Penelope’s heart—and Daniel’s, standing silently outside the door.

Penelope bit her lip. "Maybe he's angry with me. Or there was a misunderstanding. We argued the day he left—"

"That’s not love." Evelyn sighed. "I once loved someone with everything I had. The smallest scrap of attention from him felt like proof he cared. I’d cling to it for days, giddy with hope. But eventually, I realized—if someone truly loves you, they won’t make you wait. If they haven’t come back after all this time, it’s because they don’t want to."

Penelope’s teeth sank deeper into her lip.

She lifted her head, eyes red-rimmed. "How can you be so sure? My brother loved me! More than anyone! If he didn’t, why would he have sacrificed so much for me? Given me everything?"

"Maybe he did love you—once. But when he stopped, he stopped completely."

Evelyn stood. "If you’re willing to take Serena’s punishment, I won’t stop you. You made your choice. Live with it. Honestly, Willowbrook Asylum might be the best place for someone as delusional as you."

She turned and walked out.

The door clicked shut behind her. When she turned, Daniel’s dark gaze pinned her in place.

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered. She forced a smile. "Mr. Blackwood. How long have you been here?"

His voice was low. "Long enough."
###Chapter 223

Daniel's icy stare cut through her. "Obsessive and paranoid."

His lips twisted into a mocking smile. "Were you describing her... or me?"

Evelyn froze. It took her a moment to realize her words about Penelope might have unintentionally targeted Daniel too.

She shrugged it off. A gentle smile played on her lips. "Mr. Blackwood, you're reading too much into this. I'd never describe you that way." Her voice softened. "I was actually hoping you could help me track down Serena."

Daniel's brows knitted together. "We lost her trail," he admitted with a frustrated sigh. "After leaving Willowbrook Asylum, she took a cab."

Ethan stepped forward from behind Daniel, repeating the information for Evelyn's benefit. "She disappeared in the suburbs where there's no surveillance. We checked all traffic cams and public transport records - nothing."

His shoulders slumped. "She's still in Willowbrook, but we have no idea where."

Guilt washed over Evelyn. She shut her eyes tightly. "This is my fault. I wasn't careful enough."

Turning to Ethan, she bowed deeply. "Thank you for your efforts."

Ethan looked startled by her formality. He quickly reached to stop her. "There's no need for that between us."

"You're not to blame," Daniel interjected sharply. "Penelope's a reporter. Even without your slip, she would've found Serena eventually. You just sped up the inevitable."

His gaze steadied on Evelyn. "Go home. I'll review the footage again."

Nodding wearily, Evelyn turned and left.

Back at Silvercrest Manor, she collapsed onto the massive bed, exhaustion weighing her down. Fumbling with the communication necklace, she reached out to Oliver.

"Can you help me?"
"Already on it!"

Across the ocean in a hospital room, Oliver was scanning multiple surveillance feeds on his screen. "Don't beat yourself up. Serena escaping might be a blessing."

Evelyn frowned. "How?"

"I heard your conversation with Penelope. If her brother was the driver who pushed you off Harborview Bridge, then we finally have a witness to what that bastard and Serena did to you."

The realization hit Evelyn like a thunderbolt. Oliver was right.

"Plus, Penelope confirmed her brother's alive. With a witness, we can reopen your case."

Evelyn had considered using Serena and Daniel's past crimes against them before. But after six years, evidence had vanished. A living witness changed everything.

She bolted upright, excitement coursing through her. "You're absolutely right."

As she gripped the necklace to continue their discussion, her phone rang.

Victoria's name flashed on the screen.

"Ms. Carter? I'm at your house. Did you move?"
###Chapter 224

The memory hit Evelyn like a lightning bolt. She'd messaged Victoria right after escaping Willowbrook Asylum.

Their meeting point was set at Evelyn's childhood home. She needed to expose Serena's crimes to her mother face-to-face.

But Penelope's crisis had consumed her thoughts, nearly making her forget the crucial appointment.

Evelyn inhaled sharply, her gaze lifting to the stormy night sky. "I'm on my way."

The call ended with a click. She hurried downstairs to change.

"Mom, is this really necessary?" Oliver's voice chimed from the pendant. "Do you honestly think Serena would approach Grandma? She's completely under Serena's spell. Even during her asylum days, she kept running to Grandma for help."

Evelyn froze mid-motion, blouse half-buttoned.

What if this was a trap? Victoria and Serena working together...

Then again, what if Serena hadn't found her mother yet?

Victoria's trust in Evelyn was fragile at best. That damning recording had cost her dearly to obtain. This might be her only chance to reveal Serena's true nature.

Liam's sigh echoed through the pendant. "Let me call Theodore. Maybe Tyler and Dominic can escort you."

After a tense silence, Evelyn nodded. "Alright." Thirty minutes later, Theodore's call came through.

"We're waiting at Silvercrest Manor." Evelyn exhaled in relief and descended the stairs.

The living room revealed an adorable scene - Liam and Emily bent over an art project, one sketching while the other assembled crafts.

"Come home early!" Liam's cheerful voice warmed her heart.

Evelyn smiled at her children. "Want me to bring back any treats?"

Liam scrunched his nose in thought. "Nah." He gestured to their half-finished project. "Just hurry back and help with this kiddie homework."

Shaking her head with amusement, Evelyn stepped outside to find Tyler and Dominic leaning against their beat-up van.

Their sheepish grins appeared when they spotted her. "Finally! Felt like peasants parking this junker outside your palace," Dominic joked from the driver's seat.

Evelyn's lips curved as she climbed into the surprisingly spotless interior. The strong scent of dollar-store air freshener couldn't mask their thoughtful preparation.

Touched, she made conversation. "How long have you two been in Willowbrook?"

"Going on seven years," Tyler answered from the passenger seat, eyes on the passing city lights. "Don't mind our humble ride. Every penny saved means better care for our mom back home. Been sending remittances religiously."

Evelyn felt a pang of admiration. "Such filial sons. Your big break will come."

"Not likely," Tyler muttered darkly. "We're cowards at heart." His fingers tapped the window. "First year here, someone offered us a million to make a hit with this very van. We chickened out."

"Know someone who took the deal though," Dominic chimed in. "Guy's living large overseas now. Cut all ties, never looked back."

Evelyn's breath caught. The coincidence was staggering.

Her voice dropped. "Did he... have a younger sister?"

"Sister?" Tyler barked a laugh. "More like a golden goose. Some rich girl he groomed since childhood. Planned to knock her up at eighteen and marry into the family fortune."

His expression darkened. "Then the family went bankrupt six years back. Useless to him, so he took the blood money and vanished."

Tyler suddenly stiffened, turning sharply. "Wait... how'd you know about his sister?"
###Chapter 225

"I made an educated guess."

Evelyn reclined in the backseat, gazing at the nightscape flashing past the window.

Penelope's defiant eyes inexplicably surfaced in her mind.

"My brother loves me! More than anyone else in this world! If he didn't, why would he sacrifice so much for me? Why would he give me everything?"

Evelyn smirked.

Pathetic. Relationships were the most worthless things in existence.

At that moment, Penelope had reminded her so much of her younger self—naive, foolish, heartbreakingly trusting.

The van soon arrived at its destination.

Tyler and Dominic escorted Evelyn upstairs. When they reached her floor, she unlocked the door to her rented apartment.

The interior was dark. Moonlight spilled through the windows, illuminating a frail figure curled up on the sofa.

Evelyn frowned and flicked the lights on.

Victoria Sinclair stirred, blinking sleepily as the sudden brightness roused her.

When her eyes focused on Evelyn, she offered a weak, distant smile. "Ms. Carter, you're back. You mentioned you saw Serena today?"

"Yes."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. After confirming no one else was present, she shut the door firmly behind her.

She took a seat across from Victoria. "There's something I need you to hear."

Evelyn picked up a teacup, took a sip, then pulled out a recording device. She pressed play and set it on the coffee table between them.

Serena's unhinged voice erupted from the speaker.

"I've hated Evelyn since we were children! I've spent my entire life trapped in her shadow!"

"I want to ruin her! Destroy everything she holds dear!"

"I should've killed that little brat, Emily, years ago!"

Each venomous word drained more color from Victoria's face.

Her hands trembled. Her breath came in shallow gasps.

This couldn't be real. Her sweet, dutiful daughter would never—

The recording continued, each sentence detonating like grenades in Victoria's mind.

By the time it ended, Victoria had collapsed against the sofa, barely conscious. Tears streamed down her hollow cheeks.

"How?" she whispered hoarsely. "How could this happen?"

When the silence stretched too long, Victoria finally lifted her shattered gaze to Evelyn. "Did I... did I misjudge my eldest daughter? Will she ever forgive me?"

Evelyn's chest constricted.

This broken woman was her mother. The woman who'd raised her for over twenty years. The woman who should have known her better than anyone—yet had been so easily deceived.

If Evelyn hadn't obtained this evidence herself, Victoria might have died still believing the lies.

The realization made Evelyn's lips twist into a bitter smile.

"She might forgive you," Evelyn said quietly.

Victoria's eyes flickered with fragile hope.

"But she'll never respect you as a mother again." Evelyn met her gaze squarely. "Because you don't deserve it."
###Chapter 226

Evelyn Carter stared at Victoria Sinclair in stunned silence.

Victoria wiped her tears with trembling fingers. "Yes. If I were her... I'd make the same choice."

A mother should understand her daughter better than anyone. Yet...

Watching Victoria's shoulders shake with sobs, even cold-hearted Evelyn couldn't help but sigh. She handed over a tissue. "Dry your eyes."

While mother and daughter shared their emotional reunion inside, outside the door, Tyler Walsh and Dominic Shaw exchanged glances.

"Man, I'm exhausted." Dominic stretched with a yawn. Tyler rolled his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak when a shadow flickered at the stairwell.

His body tensed. "Who's there?"

A woman emerged from the darkness, her face obscured by oversized black glasses and a trench coat. "Hello," she greeted with an artificial laugh, waving a dead phone. "Here to visit someone, but my battery died. Mind if I borrow yours? Just one quick call."

Tyler studied her with narrowed eyes, remaining silent.

Ever the helpful one, Dominic handed over his device. "Make it fast. This isn't a public phone booth."

"Much obliged."

The mystery woman took the phone and descended the stairs. Once certain the bodyguards could only see her silhouette, she stopped abruptly.

Her fingers flew across the screen, locating [Boss Nathan] in the contacts. The line connected after two rings.

At Silvercrest Manor, Nathan Pierce sat at the crafts table with Emily Carter when the call came through. His small brow furrowed at Dominic's name flashing on screen. Had something happened to Mom?

"Hello?" he answered cautiously.

"Nathan," a woman's tearful voice crackled through, "It's Grandma Victoria. Your mother told me everything. Her phone died so I'm using the guard's. Please come see me? Don't tell Daniel. I just... I need to see my grandson."

Nathan's grip tightened on the phone. After a beat, he replied, "I'll be there."

Hanging up, he turned to Emily still engrossed in her glitter project. "Stay here. Important business." He grabbed his jacket and marched out.

At the front door, he collided with Daniel Blackwood returning home.

Daniel's gaze dropped to the boy's outdoor attire. "Where are you going this late?"

"Godmother needs me." The lie came smoothly. Nathan brushed past him, hailing a cab across the street.

Daniel watched the taxi disappear into the night, his expression unreadable.

The cab pulled up to Evelyn's apartment building at nine sharp. Nathan stepped out, taking a fortifying breath before entering.

First floor. Second. Third.

On the fifth floor landing, a figure lunged from the shadows.

Cold steel pressed against his throat as a hand clamped over his mouth. "Not a sound," Serena Hart hissed, dragging him backward.

Nathan didn't struggle. "Serena Hart," he stated calmly.

The blade wavered. "Clever boy," she sneered. "Just like your bitch of a mother."

"Not clever enough," Nathan countered. "Look up."

Serena's eyes flicked upward to see Tyler smirking down from the next flight. "Now look down."

Dominic advanced from below, cracking his knuckles.

Realization dawned. She'd been outmaneuvered by a child. "Loyal attack dogs you've got," she spat.

"They're my friends," Nathan corrected. "You're the one treating people like animals. Wonder when they'll bite back?"

Though held at knifepoint, his voice remained steady. Serena's grip tightened. "I should slit your throat right now!"

"Then you lose your leverage," Nathan reasoned. "You want Mom to watch me die. To break her. Too bad she's locked in her room upstairs. You'll never see that satisfaction."

Serena's lips peeled back in a snarl. As the bodyguards closed in, she yanked Nathan into a nearby apartment, slamming the door.

Lights flickered on, revealing sparse furnishings. "Rented this afternoon?" Nathan dusted off the couch. "Poor choice. Now we're both trapped."

"Shut your mouth!" Serena kicked his legs out from under him. The impact sent sharp pain radiating through his small frame.

He struggled upright, meeting her glare with a mocking smile.

Enraged, Serena struck him across the face. Once. Twice. Three times.
###Chapter 227

The sharp sound of flesh hitting flesh echoed through the room.

By the time Serena finally stopped, Liam's face was already swollen and bruised.

Only then did she feel some of her rage subside.

She straightened up, looking down at him with cold disdain.

"Weren't you supposed to be clever? Didn't you see this coming? Why did you walk right into my trap?"

Liam met her gaze steadily.

"If I didn't come, you would've gone after Sophia or Evelyn instead." His voice was calm. "They're women. I'm not."

He was the one who should take the pain.

Serena let out a mocking laugh.

"How noble. But what good does that do you now? You're still here, beaten and helpless."

Liam smirked, despite the swelling distorting his expression.

"Guess why I let you hit me?"

Serena frowned but didn't respond.

Liam tilted his head toward the window.

"Take a look outside."

Her lips pressed into a thin line. She strode to the window, yanked the curtains aside, and peered down.

Her breath hitched.

"You called the police?"

"Actually, I think Sophia did."

Liam leaned back, arms crossed. Even with his battered face, he carried the same arrogant confidence as Daniel.

It infuriated her.

She had gone to such lengths to ensure Evelyn never bore Daniel's child. She knew—even if he never admitted it—that his heart had always belonged to Evelyn.

If Evelyn had his children, no one could ever take him away.

That was why Serena had risked everything to have her killed.

But five years later, Evelyn wasn't just alive—she was more beautiful than ever. And she had given Daniel two children.

A daughter.

And a son who looked exactly like him.

Jealousy twisted inside Serena like a venomous snake, spreading poison through her veins.

She grabbed Liam by the throat, pressing the blade of a fruit knife against his skin.

"Do you really think I won't kill you right now?"

"Oh, I believe you would." Liam's smile didn't waver. "But there's something you don't know, Ms. Hart."

He tilted his head.

"From the moment you called me, you've been under surveillance. Remember when Dominic handed you the phone? He touched you."

Serena froze, trying to recall.

Dominic had been just another disposable bodyguard—dirty, beneath her notice. She had barely registered his touch.

But now, realization dawned.

"That's right." Liam's grin widened. "He planted a tracking chip on you. Every word, every move—it's all being recorded and transmitted."

He took a step back, positioning her directly in view of the window.

"Look again. The police have surrounded this place. It doesn't matter if you kill me or not. What matters is that Daniel can't protect you this time."

The evidence was undeniable.

Kidnapping. Threats. Attempted murder.

All of it had been live-streamed to the authorities.

This time, justice would prevail.

Liam had been too lenient before. He had given Daniel a chance, and Serena had slipped through the cracks.

But not today.

His gaze hardened.

"Ms. Hart, you're out of time. It's over."
###Chapter 228

"Not just for kidnapping me now, but also for trying to kill Sophia last time, and—"

Liam's eyes darkened. "And what happened six years ago. You'll pay for every crime you've committed."

Serena froze. Her limbs locked in place.

She stared blankly at Liam's small face, barely the size of her palm. "You... know about that night six years ago?"

Back then, this child was still inside Evelyn!

"Secrets don't stay buried forever." Liam smirked. "I know you worked with Daniel. I know everything."

Serena studied him closely before a slow smile curled her lips.

He claimed she'd conspired with Daniel, but the truth was—Daniel had always kept her at arm's length. He'd never stoop to working with her.

So... Evelyn Carter and her brats actually believed she and Daniel were partners?

Serena's eyes gleamed.

Perfect.

Bang!

A bullet shattered the window, striking the knife in Serena's hand with deadly precision.

She screamed, dropping the blade. It clattered to the floor.

The door burst open. Armed officers swarmed in.

Serena was tackled to the ground before she could react.

"Liam!"

Ethan rushed in with the police, but Evelyn was faster. She sprinted forward and yanked Liam into a crushing embrace. "Are you hurt?"

"I'm fine."

Feeling her tremble, Liam calmly patted her back. "See? Not a scratch."

Evelyn's vision blurred. She cupped his face, taking in the swollen cheek and dried blood at the corner of his lips. "You call this fine? I told you to stay out of this!"

If anything had happened to him because of Serena—

"I'm not a kid, Mom." Liam wiped her tears with his small hands. "Last time, she went after you and Sophia. This time, she came for me. Did you expect me to hide?"

He pulled her closer. "It's just a bruise. I can handle it."

His gaze flicked to the doorway.

Amid the chaos, a tall figure stood in the shadows. Even obscured, Liam recognized him instantly—that unmistakable aura.

Leaning in, Liam whispered, "Every word, every move Serena made was recorded and sent straight to the police chief. This time, not even Daniel can save her."

Evelyn stiffened.

It hit her then—her son had used himself as bait. He'd lured Serena into making an undeniable mistake, one that even Daniel's influence couldn't erase.

Tears spilled over. "You reckless little—"

"Takes after you." Liam pressed a quick kiss to her cheek. "Just like you trusted Daniel too much before, letting Serena slip away. I won't make that mistake."

His voice hardened. "I'll never trust him again."
###Chapter 229

Evelyn trembled at Liam's words.

She pressed her lips together and pulled him into a tight embrace. Words lodged in her throat, refusing to come out.

"But, Mommy…" Liam's voice was small, shaky. His whisper brushed against her ear like a fragile breath. "I'm so tired. I need to sleep."

Then—without warning—his small body went limp.

Evelyn barely had time to react before he slipped from her arms.

Strong hands caught him just before he hit the ground. Daniel swiftly cradled the unconscious boy against his chest.

Evelyn's pulse pounded in her ears. "Thank you." She reached for Liam, but Daniel turned away.

"Follow me," he ordered, already striding toward the door.

She hesitated only a second before trailing after him.

"Serena! Serena!"

The frantic shrieks cut through the air as Victoria barreled into the house like a woman possessed. She collided with Evelyn's shoulder hard enough to bruise, but didn't even glance her way.

"Serena, baby, hold on! Somebody—get a doctor! Save my daughter!"

Evelyn closed her eyes against the raw anguish in Victoria's voice.

She remembered their earlier conversation.

"When you thought Evelyn was dead… did you cry?"

The answer had been immediate. No. Not a single tear.

Victoria had claimed she didn't mourn because Evelyn had been a disappointment. A failure.

Yet now—

Even after learning about Serena's crimes, even after seeing the depths of her cruelty, Victoria still screamed for her. Still loved her.

Evelyn would never measure up.

She climbed into the car after Daniel, clutching Liam's limp hand as they sped toward Grandview Medical Center.

Through the window, the city blurred.

Her mind replayed Serena's hysterical confession at Willowbrook Asylum.

"I hate her! I've lived in Evelyn's shadow my whole life!"

"She was perfect. Everyone compared me to her!"

"I had to destroy her. Take everything she had!"

A bitter smile twisted Evelyn's lips.

To Serena, she had been the golden child. The one who outshone her.

But Evelyn remembered the truth.

"Evelyn, stay home and study. We're taking Serena out."

"Evelyn, you're so brilliant! Oh, Serena, don't cry—we love you too…"

She had spent her childhood chasing approval. Believing if she just worked harder, just achieved more—

Maybe then, they'd look at her the way they looked at Serena.
###Chapter 230

As Evelyn grew older, she finally understood one undeniable truth—her parents' favoritism toward Serena would never change.

So she did what any desperate daughter would do—she mimicked their behavior, showering Serena with affection in hopes of winning their approval.

Those few years when she and Serena got along were also the happiest years with her parents.

She had married the man she loved. She had her family's attention.

For a while, she truly believed she was the luckiest woman alive.

But happiness, as she learned too late, was fleeting.

All because of Serena.

And the man standing beside her now.

If Daniel hadn't grown tired of Serena, maybe Evelyn would still be the cherished one.

The car screeched to a halt outside Grandview Medical Center.

Before the engine fully died, Daniel was already out, cradling Liam in his arms as he sprinted through the entrance.

"Doctor!" His voice cut through the quiet evening, sharp with urgency.

The emergency lights cast long shadows down the sterile hallway as the on-call physician rushed forward.

Daniel moved like an unshakable force—broad shoulders tense, muscles straining as he carried Liam. A shelter against any storm.

Evelyn trailed behind, watching him.

The way his body moved with each step. The protective curve of his arms around her son.

Her chest ached with something complicated.

Her children were no different from others—they wanted a father.

She had considered giving them one.

Nathan Pierce had been her first choice. He had saved her life, pieced her back together when she was broken.

But when she suggested it, all three rejected the idea.

Oliver declared he'd rather have no father than a stranger.

Liam claimed he didn't need one as long as Evelyn was happy.

Sophia, stubborn as ever, insisted she only wanted her real father.

Back then, they were too young to understand who Daniel truly was.

Now that they knew the truth, they'd started scheming to push her toward Nathan instead.

But Evelyn always knew the truth—Liam, who pretended indifference, longed for a father more than anyone.

Even after deciding Daniel was a worthless man, he still gave him a chance.

Why else would Liam have handed over the evidence of Serena hurting Sophia?

Yet Daniel had failed him. Again.

"Nothing serious," the doctor announced after a quick examination. "Extreme stress and exhaustion. He needs rest and fluids. I'll start an IV and give him something for the facial swelling."

Then the doctor frowned at Daniel. "Listen, I don't care what the kid did—you can't beat a child like this. What kind of father are you? Violence solves nothing!"

Silence thickened in the room.

Finally, Daniel sighed. "He's not my son. I'm not his father."

He only had a daughter.

The doctor scoffed. "Really? You're going to deny it? Look at his face—then look in a mirror. The resemblance is uncanny. You expect anyone to believe he's not yours?"
###Chapter 231

"Doctor, didn't you mention I needed an IV drip?"

Evelyn turned sharply toward the physician. "Would you like to administer it now?"

The doctor's brow furrowed before he caught his mistake. "I'll prepare it immediately," he muttered before exiting.

Once alone, Daniel's gaze dropped to Liam's still form.

His eyes then flicked to the window, studying his own reflection.

The resemblance was... uncanny.

A smirk played at his lips as he examined the mirror image. "Wouldn't have noticed without the comment."

Evelyn maintained perfect composure while her pulse raced.

Daniel missed nothing. The "best friend" cover had worked before, but explaining the children...

She inhaled deeply, forcing a laugh that crinkled her eyes. "Handsome people share features. My ex couldn't hold a candle to Liam."

Daniel's eyebrow arched slightly, but he remained silent.

The doctor returned promptly with the IV equipment, which the nurse administered.

Evelyn pulled a chair close, keeping vigil over her son.

Daniel leaned against the doorframe, his towering silhouette casting a long shadow as his darkening gaze lingered on mother and child.

Next morning

Golden sunlight flooded the room as Evelyn stirred awake.

She blinked against the brightness.

Silvercrest Manor's master bedroom?

She bolted upright, blankets flying.

Daylight? Hadn't she been at Grandview Medical Center watching over Liam's IV?

"Must you always wake like a hurricane?"

An indignant voice came from beneath the displaced covers. Sophia emerged, scowling. "Nearly smothered me!"

Evelyn's cheeks flushed as she realized her abrupt movement had buried her daughter.

She gathered Sophia close. "How did I get here?"

"You fell asleep during Liam's treatment," the girl explained, nestling closer. "When he woke, he and Father brought you home."

Sophia's whisper tickled Evelyn's ear. "Father carried you from the hospital. Did you dream of him? You kept saying his name."

Evelyn froze.

She had dreamed of their early days together.

But...

Her lips pursed. "How did he... react?"

Sophia shrugged. "No reaction. But he seemed... pleased. Carried you all the way home."

Evelyn's brow furrowed before she changed subjects. "Where's Liam?"

"His room. Won't see anyone."

Sophia tugged her mother's hand. "His face looks so painful."

Evelyn allowed herself to be led to Liam's chamber - a space Daniel had personally designed for the boy.

She'd assumed Daniel would treat Liam merely as her friend's son, not with the same devotion as...
###Chapter 232

She couldn't have been more mistaken.
Liam's room was... extravagant. Every detail screamed luxury, rivaling even Sophia's quarters.

The spacious chamber held an air of opulence. Liam lounged in his chair, fingers deftly twisting a Rubik's cube. The mask and hat he wore only added to his effortlessly cool demeanor.

When Evelyn and Grace stepped inside, his gaze flicked up. A faint smile curved his lips as he addressed his mother. "Sleep well?"

"Like a dream."

Evelyn's eyes burned. Her son had always been proud—obsessed with looking sharp, acting untouchable.

Yet here he was, deliberately marring his perfect skin just to trap Serena.

"Don't cry," Liam chuckled, voice light. "Pain doesn't scare me."

Then his expression sobered. He met Evelyn's gaze head-on. "The police called. They need my guardian—you—to come with me to file an official report."

A glance at his watch. "It's nine. If we leave now, we'll be back by lunch."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. She nodded. "Okay."

Hand in hand, they descended the stairs.

Daniel Blackwood waited below, elegantly sprawled on the sofa, newspaper in hand. The rustle of footsteps made him glance up. "Police station?"

"Yes." Evelyn kept her voice even. "If we're late, we'll eat out."

Daniel's eyes narrowed. That piercing stare of his—like he could dissect her thoughts with a single look.

A beat passed. Then he smirked. "You'll make it back."

The weight of his gaze followed them as Evelyn tightened her grip on Liam's hand and marched out.

Daniel watched them go. The moment the door shut, he tossed the newspaper aside and picked up a file from the coffee table.

The police station loomed ahead. Evelyn and Liam had barely stepped out of the car when two figures intercepted them.

Richard and Victoria Sinclair.

Her parents.

Six years had changed her father. Thinner now, but vibrant—alive in a way she'd never seen before.

"Ms. Carter." Richard extended a hand, polite to a fault. "I'm Richard Sinclair, Serena Hart's father."

Evelyn swallowed the bitterness rising in her throat. She shook his hand. "Mr. Sinclair."

"We'd like to talk," Richard said softly. "About yesterday... Our daughter made a terrible mistake. The lawyer says her sentence could be reduced if you show leniency."

Victoria's tears fell freely. "She's all we have left, Evelyn. You wouldn't let them take her from us, would you?"

The sun beat down. Evelyn's vision swam. That word—left—stabbed through her like a blade.

She pressed fingers to her temples. When she looked up, her voice was ice.

"The only daughter you have left? So to you, Evelyn Sinclair is already dead?"
###Chapter 233

The moment Evelyn Carter's name was mentioned, Richard Sinclair's expression darkened. His voice dropped to a whisper. "If she truly considered us family, she would have returned years ago! Instead, she's playing these mind games—sending her daughter back while she remains hidden. Not a single trace of her."

Beside him, Victoria Sinclair's brows knitted together in disapproval. "Ms. Carter, we're here to discuss our youngest daughter. Must you bring up our eldest?"

"Exactly."

Richard quickly steered the conversation back on track. "Ms. Carter, name your price. As long as you can control your son and stop him from spreading lies, we'll pay whatever you demand. After all, Daniel is my son-in-law. Money isn't an issue."

For a brief moment, Evelyn couldn't believe these were her biological parents.

"I don't want your money," she said coldly.

Liam Carter's small hand tightened around hers. His young face was set in a fierce glare. "Serena may be your precious daughter, but I'm my mother's precious son too! Did you really think we'd just forget what happened? No. We're taking this to the end. Not only will I tell the police everything, but I'll make sure everyone knows Serena Hart is a horrible person!" He lifted his phone. "And don't bother us again. I recorded everything you just said. If you don’t want this played for the police, stay away from us!"

With that, the little boy tugged Evelyn forward, striding confidently into the police station.

Just before stepping inside, Evelyn glanced back.

Richard and Victoria stood frozen, their faces slack with shock. The wind tousled their graying hair. She closed her eyes briefly, a wave of resignation washing over her.

"Ms. Carter, Liam."

A young, sharp-eyed officer greeted them with a polite smile. "Please recount yesterday's events truthfully."

Evelyn pushed aside her thoughts and complied, guiding Liam through the report.

Once everything was documented, the officer hesitated. "The accused, Serena Hart, has requested to speak with you. Would you like to see her?"

After settling Liam in a quiet corner, Evelyn followed the officer to the visitation room.

Yesterday, Serena had been a deranged patient in Willowbrook Asylum.

Today, she was a criminal behind bars.

Evelyn took a seat across from her, posture composed. "Ms. Hart."

"Ms. Carter."

Serena studied her face intently before laughing. "Your face is flawless. No matter how closely I look, there's not a single trace of the past. You must have spent a fortune on plastic surgery."

Evelyn's jaw tightened.

"Should I call you Ms. Carter… or should I use your real name, Evelyn, like I used to?"

Serena's gaze grew wilder by the second. "I should have known. You were never the type to abandon your daughter and disappear. Instead, you hid behind a mask, pretending to be someone else." She smirked. "Aren't you exhausted?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed.

So, Serena had figured it out.

No point pretending anymore.

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "Not half as exhausted as you. Playing the devoted sister to my face while poisoning our parents against me, scheming to steal everything I had…"
###Chapter 234

"Honestly, you look more exhausted than I am."

Serena's face paled momentarily at Evelyn's words. But the reaction vanished as quickly as it appeared.

With a mocking sigh, she tilted her head. "Six whole years to figure it all out? How pathetic."

She shrugged dramatically. "Fine, I admit defeat against you and that little demon spawn. But don't celebrate too soon..."

Leaning forward until her face hovered inches above the table, Serena fixed Evelyn with a venomous stare. "You were always the stupid one, Evelyn. Look what you've done to yourself - not a trace of Evelyn Carter remains. No fingerprints, no birthmarks, nothing. How exactly do you plan to prove your identity now? How will you ever return to Daniel's arms?"

Evelyn's lips curled into an icy smile. "Why would I want to go back to him?"

"Ha!"

Serena's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Then who's going to protect your precious children?"

As Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, Serena cut her off with chilling finality. "Time's up."

Her eyes flicked to the wall clock behind Evelyn. "Right now, the real Evelyn Carter is already at Silvercrest Manor."

That predatory smile returned. "If you won't claim your identity, don't worry - someone else will do it for you. And she'll be more than happy to raise your children too."

"What are you talking about?"

Serena bared her teeth in a grotesque grin. "I'm saying... even though I lost, you didn't win either, Evelyn Carter."

A pause. Then correction: "My mistake. You are Evelyn."

Abruptly, she turned and shouted for the guard. "I'm done here! Take me back!"

Watching Serena being led away, Evelyn's stomach twisted with dread. Silvercrest Manor...

Meanwhile, at the lavish estate, Daniel sat gripping a forensic report, his knuckles white.

"...conclusive evidence indicates both handwriting samples originated from the same individual..."

He set the document down, pulse racing. Between this report and the doctor's revelations yesterday...

The truth pressed against his ribs like a caged animal. The woman he knew as Evelyn... was almost certainly Evelyn Carter!

"Ethan!" he barked, turning toward his assistant. "Is she still at the police station?"

Ethan nodded from his post by the door. "The driver confirms they haven't left yet."

"I'm going to get her myself!"

Daniel snatched his jacket, but before he could take three steps, the head butler came rushing in, face flushed.

"Sir! It's... it's Madam! She's returned! She's waiting at the gates right now!"

Daniel's brows slammed together. "What madam?"

"Your wife! Evelyn Carter! She's home!"
###Chapter 235

The butler's announcement sent Daniel reeling.

His grip on the whiskey glass tightened as he turned sharply. "Say that again... who's here?"

"Daniel, I'm home."

A woman's voice—light, melodic—floated through the foyer.

His breath hitched.

That voice.

He knew it instantly, even after all these years.

Slowly, he turned toward the sound, his dark eyes locking onto the figure standing in the doorway.

Serena Hart.

His Serena.

The woman who had haunted his dreams for six long years.

A smirk curled her lips as she watched his stunned reaction. "What's wrong?" she teased, tilting her head. "Aren't you happy to see me?"

Daniel's throat tightened.

For the first time in his life, the unshakable Daniel Blackwood was at a loss for words.

His pulse roared in his ears.

Then, without warning, he crossed the room in three long strides and pulled her into his arms.

"You're really back."

Her body was warm against his, but something felt... off.

A coldness lingered beneath her skin.

He ignored it.

This was Serena. His wife. The love of his life.

He buried his face in her hair, inhaling deeply.

All this time, he'd thought Evelyn was playing some twisted game, using Serena's face to manipulate him.

But no.

Fate had finally smiled upon him.

His Serena had returned.

"Daddy!"

A small voice shattered the moment.

Emily stood at the top of the staircase, her little fists clenched at her sides.

Her wide eyes darted between Daniel and the woman in his arms.

Then her face crumpled.

She raced down the steps, her tiny feet pounding against the marble.

"Daddy, who is that?" she demanded, tugging at his sleeve.

Daniel pulled back, his expression softening. "Emily, look who's here."

The little girl turned, her breath catching when she saw the woman's face.

Her eyes widened in horror.

She stumbled back.

"No!" Emily shook her head violently. "That's not Mommy! Who are you?!"

Serena sighed, her lips curving into a sad smile as she glanced at Daniel.

"I told you this would happen."

Daniel frowned, looking between them.

Something was wrong.

Terribly wrong.
###Chapter 236

"She's your real mother."

"No, she's not!"

The little girl's voice trembled with fury, her eyes welling up. "My mommy doesn't look like that! She's lying!"

Daniel's expression darkened as he glanced at the woman standing before them. "Sophia, listen—"

The woman sighed, rubbing her temples. "I knew this would happen..."

She pulled out a tissue, dabbing at her tears as she gazed sorrowfully at Emily. "After I gave birth to my twins, Emily and Liam, my health deteriorated. I never had the chance to recover properly. Then, one day, when I was distracted... someone took them from me."

Her voice cracked as she continued. "She was a jewelry designer—I met her at the hospital. At first, she seemed kind. I trusted her completely. But when she found out you were their father... she stole them from me."

Her shoulders shook as fresh tears spilled. "For years, I hid my identity, changed my name to Diana, and searched everywhere for you and the children. I was too afraid to approach you... I thought you'd blame me for losing them. But when I saw you publicly acknowledge our daughter, I knew that woman must have returned them to you. That's why I came here today..."

Then, she dropped to her knees, arms outstretched toward Emily. "Sweetheart, please... come to Mommy."

Emily recoiled, her small hands balling into fists. "You're lying!"

The woman's face crumpled, but she wiped her tears away. "You were so young when you were taken... of course you wouldn't remember me. I don't blame you..."

Daniel's jaw clenched as he studied her devastated expression. A storm of rage brewed inside him.

A jewelry designer. Stole his children.

Now it made sense.

No wonder Liam looked so much like him. No wonder Evelyn had been Emily's design teacher.

She was the one who had taken them.

And she had the audacity to stay by his side, pretending to be Evelyn Carter's friend!

Just as his fury threatened to erupt, the front door swung open.

The person who stepped inside was none other than Evelyn—the woman he wanted to destroy.

"I want spicy fish for lunch," Liam announced as he marched in.

Evelyn sighed, following behind. "Your stomach just recovered. Are you sure you can handle it?"

"I'm fine! I haven't had it in forever!"

The moment Liam entered the living room, he froze at the sight of Daniel's murderous glare. Instinctively, his expression turned icy. "What's your problem, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Liam!"

A desperate cry cut through the tension.

The woman in the flowing dress lunged forward, wrapping her arms around Liam in a crushing embrace. "I missed you so much!"

Liam shoved her away, disgust twisting his features. "Who the hell are you? Get off me!"

Daniel's voice turned lethal. "Don't speak to your mother like that."

The words struck like a slap.

Liam's eyes widened, then narrowed. "Are you insane? My mother is Evelyn!"

"Your mother is Diana Hart," Daniel snapped, pointing at the weeping woman. "Not the criminal who kidnapped you!"

Before Liam could retort, the woman released him, turning tear-filled eyes toward Evelyn.

"Ms. Carter... please. Give me back my children."

Evelyn finally got a clear look at her face.

Her breath hitched.

If she hadn't spent years adjusting to her own reflection, she would have thought she was staring into a mirror.

This woman... looked exactly like her.
###Chapter 237

Evelyn's mind reeled.

The woman before her—who was she? "Evelyn."

Tear-streaked and trembling, the woman lifted her gaze. "I trusted you as my closest friend. I confided in you. I even asked you to watch over my children." Her voice cracked. "And this is how you repay me? You stole them from me!"

Hatred burned in her eyes. "You ruined my life. Do you have any idea what I've endured these past six years?"

Then, with a feral scream, she lunged. Her hands closed around Evelyn's throat like a vise. "What will it take? Should I snap your bones? Flay your skin? Would that make up for what you've done?"

Evelyn staggered back, slamming against the door with a deafening crash.

The ornate metalwork dug into her spine. Pain flared.

Still, the woman squeezed tighter. "I want you dead."

Evelyn gasped, voice hoarse. "Who... are you?"

Why did this stranger wear her old face? Why claim the children as hers?

"I'm Evelyn Carter. The real one." Venom laced the woman's whisper. "Stop deluding Daniel. Stop poisoning my children. You vile impostor!"

"Mommy!"

Liam snapped out of his daze.

He hurled himself forward, clawing at the woman's arms. "Let her go! She's my mommy!"

"No, I am!" The woman snarled, tightening her grip.

Sophia charged in next.

The siblings pulled with all their might, but the woman's hold didn't budge.

She was terrifyingly strong.

Liam locked eyes with Sophia. A silent understanding passed between them.

Simultaneously, they sank their teeth into the woman's wrists.

A shriek ripped through Silvercrest Manor.

The woman recoiled, releasing Evelyn, who crumpled to the floor.

"Evie!"

Daniel hadn't anticipated the children's attack. He caught the sobbing woman, scanning her injuries. "Are you hurt?"

Meanwhile, Liam and Sophia crouched beside Evelyn. "Does it hurt bad?" they whispered.

Daniel's jaw clenched as he glared at them.

The woman buried her face in his chest, shoulders shaking. "See? They've bonded with her. They don't... don't recognize me..."

His expression softened. "They will. Once they understand, they'll come around."

She nodded meekly, tears dripping onto his shirt.

No one saw the triumphant smirk she hid in the folds of fabric.
###Chapter 238

"Ms. Evelyn."

After ensuring 'Evelyn Carter' was seated comfortably, Daniel approached her with an icy stare, his expression dripping with disdain as he looked down at her. "Do you know the penalty for kidnapping?"

Evelyn lifted her chin, a bitter smirk curling her lips. "Kidnapping?"

"Wasn't that what you did?"

He crouched down, his eyes as cold as midwinter frost. "Liam and Sophia are my children with Evelyn Carter. Six years ago, while she was vulnerable, you stole them and raised them as your own. That's the truth, isn't it?"

His gaze flicked to the steel watch on his wrist. "The police will be here any minute. Given that you never harmed Liam and Sophia—and even risked your life for Sophia—I might put in a good word for you in court. But the punishment you deserve? You'll face every second of it."

As if on cue, the wail of sirens pierced the air outside.

Evelyn let out a hollow laugh. "You believe her that easily?"

"She's my wife," Daniel replied coldly.

The irony of his words nearly made her laugh.

Since when had he ever cared about her?

Before, no matter what she said or did, he dismissed her like background noise.

Now, he obeyed every word from this imposter without question.

She inhaled sharply, then smirked. "Are you certain she's your wife?"

"Of course I am."

The woman on the sofa dabbed at her tears, lifting a face identical to Evelyn Carter's. "If I'm not his wife, then are you? Evelyn, I knew it! First, you stole my children, and now you're trying to steal my husband!"

Evelyn's brow furrowed, but before she could respond, the butler ushered the police inside.

"Which one of you is Ms. Evelyn?"

With a quiet sigh, she pushed herself up from the floor. "I am."

She had just left the police station—now, she was returning as a criminal.

"Don't take my mommy!"

Sophia's small voice cracked through the tension.

She threw herself in front of Evelyn, arms outstretched like a tiny shield. "She's my mommy! She didn't kidnap anyone! I won't let you hurt her!"

The sight made Daniel's jaw tighten.

Just as he suspected.

No wonder Sophia had always avoided mentioning Evelyn Carter—she, like Liam, had been fooled into believing this woman was her mother.

He exhaled sharply, scooped Sophia into his arms, and spoke with forced patience. "You're too young to understand."

"I do understand!" Sophia thrashed against him, her voice breaking. "I want to protect Mommy! Let me go!"

Her struggles only deepened the crease between his brows.

"Officers."

Unlike his sister, Liam remained eerily composed.

He leveled a cool, commanding stare at the policemen—a miniature version of Daniel's own authority. "I'm Daniel Blackwood's son. You know what happens if you upset me or my sister."

The officers exchanged amused glances. "Relax, kid. We're just taking her in for questioning. No need for threats."

As cold metal clamped around her wrists, Evelyn met Liam's gaze. "Take care of your sister."
###Chapter 239

Evelyn was dragged away by the police.

Sophia thrashed violently in Daniel's arms. "Let me go! I want Mommy!"

"Sophia, your Mommy is right here."

The woman who had been silently observing from the sofa finally stood, her lips curling into a gentle smile as she approached. She caught Sophia's flailing hands with practiced ease. "That woman was an imposter. I'm your real mother."

"Liar!"

Sophia yanked her hand free, glaring with all the fury a child could muster. "You're not my Mommy! My Mommy doesn't look like you!"

"Sophia, this is what your mother truly looks like."

Daniel's patience wore thin as the little girl continued to struggle. He set her down firmly, his gaze shifting to Isabelle lingering near the staircase. "Take her upstairs. She's too upset right now."

Then, his eyes locked onto Liam, who hadn't moved an inch. "You should go too. Your mother and I need to talk."

Liam's stare was icy as it flickered between Daniel and the woman claiming to be their mother.

"Disgusting."

He spat at her feet before grabbing Sophia's hand. "Come on."

"They still refuse to accept me..." The woman's voice trembled, fresh tears spilling.

"Give them time."

Daniel guided her back to the sofa, his grip warm and reassuring. His dark eyes searched hers. "Diana, tell me everything. What happened to you all these years?"

She bit her lip. "Maybe... you shouldn't call me Diana anymore. I haven't gone by Evelyn Carter in a long time. I'm Alice Hart now. Please, just call me Alice."

Daniel's brow furrowed, but he remained silent.

"I know it's hard to adjust."

Alice wiped at her tears. "But Daniel, you saw that woman. She wasn't Evelyn before—she stole my name after kidnapping my children. She's vile. Twisted. She took my identity to deceive everyone, to make them believe she was the real Evelyn Carter!" Her voice cracked. "Since she's tainted that name, I don't want it anymore. From now on, I'm Alice Hart."

The raw pain in her bloodshot eyes twisted something in Daniel's chest.

He squeezed her hand. "Alright. Alice it is."

A name was just a label. If Evelyn truly was capable of such cruelty...

He understood her decision completely.

"Thank you..."

Alice collapsed against him, her body shaking with quiet sobs. "Daniel, I missed you so much."

The words hit him like a bullet.

He pulled her closer. "I won't let you go again."

Evelyn was processed at the station, interrogated, and finally thrown into a cell.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor—she was placed with Serena.

"Well, well. Ms. Evelyn."

Serena lounged on her bunk, the orange jumpsuit doing nothing to dull her smirk. "This morning you were gloating, and now look at you."

Evelyn ignored her, arranging her thin blanket with deliberate calm.

Serena's laughter rang louder.

"Does it hurt? Being accused of kidnapping your own kids?"

Evelyn froze. Slowly, she turned.

"You know what happened?"

Serena grinned. "Of course I do."
###Chapter 240

Serena stretched lazily. "You see, the current Diana Hart was once my sister Evelyn Carter."

Evelyn froze.

"So, her name is Diana Hart." But something didn't add up.

She was absolutely certain she didn’t have a twin sister.

Then how could this woman, Diana Hart, look exactly like her before the accident?

"She's Diana Hart, but she's also Evelyn Carter."

Serena shifted into a more relaxed position, leaning against the bed. "Ms. Evelyn, care to guess which one of us will leave this place first?"

Evelyn shot her a glance before turning away and settling onto her own bed.

She had no time for Serena’s games.

Her mind was racing.

Who was this Diana Hart?

At Silvercrest Manor, in the children’s room...

Sophia buried her face under her pillow, sobbing uncontrollably.

Isabelle patted her back helplessly. "Ms. Sophia, crying won’t solve anything..."

Her words only made Sophia cry harder. "Oliver, what do you think?"

Liam remained composed, seated at the desk across the room, speaking to Oliver through the computer screen. "This woman knows too much about our family. But her information isn’t complete. She claimed Mommy kidnapped two children, but she didn’t realize... we’re actually triplets."

On the other end of the call, Oliver reclined against his headboard, fingers flying over the keyboard.

Three monitors glowed in front of him.

One displayed his conversation with Liam.

Another played live security footage from Silvercrest Manor and the prison cell.

The third showed Diana’s meticulously fabricated profile.

"She came prepared."

Oliver’s brows furrowed as he scanned the details. "Every piece of her background is carefully constructed. Injured in Willowbrook, then moved overseas for treatment... It’s obvious someone crafted this for her, but they didn’t know Mommy had already given birth. Maybe they thought she was dead. They only learned about the pregnancy after arriving in Willowbrook. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have left such a glaring omission."

Liam nodded.

"She should’ve anticipated this. Even though Daniel Blackwood is an idiot, his public image is one of unwavering loyalty to Mommy. If I were a woman, I’d want to be the one he cherishes most."

Oliver sighed. "You’re too young to be analyzing love rivals like this."

Liam scowled. "Stop teasing me. The real problem is getting Mommy out of prison."

"Exactly."

Oliver’s expression darkened. "We can’t control who comes and goes in that place. If they force a confession out of her..."

"But what can we do?" Liam slumped in his chair, frustration creeping into his voice. "Right now, Daniel only sees that woman. He’ll believe anything she says."

Just as the brothers fell silent, Sophia suddenly sat up, wiping her tears.

"I know how to save Mommy."
###Chapter 241

"Daniel, I've been longing for you."

Back at Silvercrest Manor, Diana closed the bedroom door and wrapped her arms around Daniel from behind.

"All those years away... There were moments I nearly gave up. But remembering you and the kids kept me going." Her voice trembled. "You were my reason to survive. Thank God we're finally reunited."

Tears soaked through his shirt, dampening his skin.

An invisible fist clenched around Daniel's heart.

He turned and pulled her close. "No more suffering. I promise."

Diana sniffled against his chest. "I just hope that woman who stole our children... gets what she deserves."

Her fingers curled into his shirt. "You saw how Liam and Emily defend her. They refuse to accept me as their mother." A tear slid down her cheek. "The faster she's behind bars, the sooner they'll—"

Daniel's brow furrowed.

Evelyn's devastated expression when the police took her away flashed through his mind.

His pulse stuttered.

"We should proceed carefully," he said after a pause. "This case needs thorough investigation."

Despite the damning evidence, something didn't sit right.

He'd witnessed firsthand how Evelyn protected Emily and Liam during the crisis.

No matter her crimes, the children adored her.

Rushing this would only alienate them further.

Diana's lips thinned. She pressed closer. "But how can they ever love me while she's—"

"Trust our children." Daniel smoothed her hair. "Be patient."

She hesitated. "...Alright."

Then she tilted her face up, arms looping around his neck. "Daniel... I've missed you so much."

The air between them grew charged.

Before him stood the woman he'd mourned for six years.

Daniel leaned in, drawn by instinct...

But stopped mere centimeters from her lips.

Too much time had passed.

The intimacy felt... wrong.

"Daddy!"

Emily's voice shattered the moment.

Daniel jerked back to find his daughter standing in the doorway, eyes red-rimmed. "I want to sleep with you tonight."

Diana's smile turned brittle. "Emily, you're too old for that. Big girls don't—"

"I'm still little!" The child glared defiantly. "It's my right! Why are you jealous?"

Daniel chuckled at her audacity.

Scooping her up, he said, "What mother gets jealous of her own daughter? You'll sleep with Daddy tonight."

Diana's nails dug into her palms. "But Daniel... Our first night together in six years..."

"Plenty of nights ahead." He adjusted Emily in his arms. "Rest well."

As he carried his daughter away, Emily peeked over his shoulder and stuck out her tongue.

Diana's pleasant mask shattered the moment they left.

She'd finally reclaimed her place as Mrs. Blackwood.

Finally had Daniel where she wanted him.

Yet that wretched child—!

Her fist slammed into the mattress.

The game wasn't over yet.
###Chapter 242

Suddenly, two children appeared - a boy and a girl - along with Evelyn Carter after her plastic surgery transformation.

She slammed the door shut, her fingers trembling with rage as she dialed a number.

"Mr. Prescott," she hissed into the phone. "Make arrangements for Evelyn to have an accident in prison."

Knock knock knock.

The sharp rapping on her door cut her off. "We'll continue this later."

Forcing a sweet smile, Diana Hart opened the door. "Who is it?"

"Ms. Hart, it's me."

Standing in the hallway was Liam Carter, dressed in soft yellow pajamas. He tilted his head, his innocent eyes wide. "I went to find Daddy, but he said he's staying with Emily tonight. So he sent me to keep you company."

The corridor lights illuminated his cherubic face, making him look harmless as a kitten. Despite herself, Diana felt her cold heart soften slightly.

After a brief hesitation, she stepped aside. "Come in."

The moment Liam entered, Diana shut the door behind him.

The boy's innocent expression vanished instantly. He settled into an armchair with surprising elegance. "You look exactly like the photos of my mother."

Diana perched on the edge of the bed, maintaining her gentle facade. "That's because I am your real mother."

"Really?" Liam gave a faint smile. "Then let's all take a paternity test tomorrow. We'll ask Mr. Blackwood to arrange it. Immediate results. Then we can finally be a proper family. What do you say?"

Diana's smile froze.

A DNA test with Daniel would expose everything.

Her eyes narrowed. "Don't you trust me, child?"

Liam stretched lazily. "Only test results can convince me and my sister. If they prove you're our mother, we'll call you Mommy right then and there. Deal?"

Diana studied him carefully.

After a long pause, she scoffed. "Trying to scare me off?"

This child was frighteningly clever - cutting straight to the heart of the matter the moment he entered.

He must already know the truth.

"I'm here to negotiate, Ms. Hart."

Liam yawned, his tone casual. "You had my real mother arrested as soon as you arrived. You clearly have connections inside. I'm worried about her safety, just like you're worried we'll expose you with a DNA test."

Diana's cold gaze remained locked on him.

"So this is your bargaining chip?"

"Exactly." The boy crossed his legs, meeting her stare unflinchingly. "Mutually beneficial. Otherwise, we'll insist Mr. Blackwood arranges testing for all of us. I'm certain he'd agree."

The standoff lasted nearly a minute before Diana suddenly laughed.

"You'd really keep my secret if I release Evelyn?"

"I won't play the DNA card," Liam corrected. "But let's be honest - you'll never promise to stop threatening our mother. This is just temporary cooperation."

Another yawn. "I'm tired. You have five minutes to decide."

Diana clenched her teeth.

Just like his father - infuriatingly intelligent.

Then a new thought struck her. "Tell me something. Why hasn't Evelyn revealed her true identity? If she wanted Daniel back, wouldn't that be the fastest way?"

Liam's eyes gleamed.

If she discovered the truth, more trouble would follow. So he simply smirked. "Because we only want something from that fool Blackwood. We'll disappear once we get it."
###Chapter 243

The first light of morning found Daniel still wrapped in sleep when tiny fingers prodded his cheek.

"Daddy," Emily whispered, her voice laced with childish wonder, "how come you're so pretty?"

A sleepy chuckle rumbled in his chest as he blinked awake. His hand automatically rose to tousle her soft curls. "Don't you like having a pretty daddy?"

"Obviously!" Her grin stretched wide, eyes crinkling into delighted crescents. Before he could react, small palms framed his face as she planted a wet kiss on his cheek. "But you'd be even prettier if you let Aunt Evelyn go."

The name sliced through the morning's warmth like winter wind. Daniel's expression darkened as he studied his daughter. "You want her free that badly?"

"Yes!" Emily clung to his arm, her earnestness undeniable. "She's always taken care of me. If she hadn't, would I be here—happy and healthy—with you?" Her lower lip trembled. "She's good, Daddy. I can't stand seeing her hurt."

His jaw tightened. He'd witnessed Evelyn's kindness toward Emily firsthand. The woman had a gentle soul. So why... why had she done what she did years ago?

Emily's wide, pleading eyes held his. "Please, Daddy? Let her go?"

A sigh escaped him as he smoothed her hair. "It's not just my decision to make."

Both he and Diana were victims in this tangled mess. His forgiveness alone meant nothing when Diana bore the deepest scars.

"So if Aunt Diana drops the charges..." Emily pressed, hope lighting her features, "you'll stop too, right?"

Silence stretched between them before Daniel gave a single nod. "If she walks away, so do I."

"Promise?" At his confirmation, she scrambled off the bed, darting toward the bathroom with the energy only children possess at dawn.

Shaking his head, Daniel followed to wash away the night's remnants.

By the time he carried Emily downstairs, Liam and Diana were already seated at the breakfast table.

"Morning, Mr. Blackwood," Liam drawled, barely looking up from his juice.

Daniel deposited Emily into her chair before leveling a stern look at the boy. "It's 'Dad.'"

Liam rolled his eyes. "Isn't Emily enough for you?" He turned to Diana with an impish smirk. "Right, Gorgeous Hart?"

Daniel's chair scraped loudly as he sat beside Diana, irritation rolling off him in waves. "You call your father 'Mr. Blackwood' and your mother 'Gorgeous Hart'?"

A shrug. "I'll call you what I want."

"Daniel." Diana's quiet interjection cut through the tension. She forced a smile toward Liam. "They can call us whatever they're comfortable with. These things take time."

Truthfully, she wasn't ready to hear "Mom" from them yet either. The weight of that title still felt foreign.

The meal passed in relative silence, each occupant lost in private calculations.

Once breakfast ended, Diana tugged Daniel onto the living room sofa. "We need to talk."

At her words, Liam shot Emily a conspiratorial look. The children immediately plopped onto the carpet with building blocks, their sudden interest in construction clearly a ruse to listen in.

Diana suppressed an eye roll. These scheming children—barely tall enough to reach the kitchen counters yet masters of espionage.

Daniel's voice pulled her back. "What is it?"

She hesitated, then plunged in. "I think we should drop the case against Evelyn."
###Chapter 244

Daniel's brow furrowed, but he stayed quiet.

"I thought about it all night," Evelyn murmured. "Even though Diana made mistakes in the past, she took good care of the children. They turned out so well-behaved partly because of her. She's atoned for what she did. I just want to put it behind us."

Daniel's frown deepened. "Is that really how you feel?"

"Yes." Evelyn reached for his hand, her fingers curling around his. "The kids adore her. I don’t want to see them upset. Besides, she’s the Design Director at Blackwood Group now—a rare talent. The company needs her. So… I think we should give her another chance."

Her voice was so earnest that even Liam and Sophia, playing with their blocks on the floor, couldn’t help but glance up in admiration.

No wonder she had the audacity to steal someone else’s identity.

Her acting was flawless.

"Evelyn, I'm glad you feel this way."

With a sigh, Daniel pulled her onto his lap, wrapping his arms around her. "You're still as kind as I remember."

He had always known Evelyn to be gentle and compassionate—just like this.

Yesterday, watching her nearly choke Diana and demand her removal, he’d been shocked.

For a moment, he thought she’d changed.

But now, hearing her words, the weight on his chest lifted. His Evelyn hadn’t changed at all.

"Call me Evelyn."

She rested her head against his chest, her voice soft. "I don’t want to use that name anymore."

Daniel nodded, his fingers brushing through her hair. "Evelyn."

He held her tighter. After a long pause, he exhaled. "There's one more thing."

His gaze dropped, his thumb tracing her brow. "What do you want to do about… Serena?"

Until now, he hadn’t taken action against Serena, only keeping her locked up. He’d been waiting—waiting for Evelyn to come home.

He wanted her to decide.

Now that she was back, the choice was hers.

Evelyn tensed slightly.

"That woman tried to kill me and Sophia multiple times," Liam muttered, stacking his blocks without looking up. "Don’t tell me you’re going to let her walk free."

"Of course not." Evelyn’s lips curved into a faint smile. "But Daniel… she’s still my sister."

Sophia and Liam exchanged glances.

This woman!

She wanted to let Serena go?!

After everything they’d endured—after finally getting her locked up—she wanted to release her?!

Daniel studied Evelyn’s face. "What do you propose?"

"What she did to our children was unforgivable," Evelyn admitted. "But she’s my parents’ favorite. If we punish her too harshly, they’ll never recover. So…"

She tilted her head. "Why not buy her a one-way ticket overseas? As long as she never returns, she’ll never hurt Liam or Sophia again. And my parents won’t cause trouble for us. Two birds with one stone."

"No!"

Sophia’s eyes burned red. She hurled a block across the room. "I want her punished! I don’t want her to get away with it!"

That woman was pure evil. How could they just let her go?

Then, she jabbed a finger at Evelyn, her voice shaking. "Why are you defending her? Aren’t you afraid I’ll tell Daddy?"
###Chapter 245

"Sophia."

Liam tightened his grip on his sister's trembling hand.

"I apologize. She's too upset right now."

The boy shielded Sophia before turning an icy glare toward Daniel. "If this is your final decision, we can't stop you."

"Children's opinions don't matter much anyway. But promise us one thing—Serena will never cross paths with us again. Not for the rest of our lives."

His voice was chillingly calm. "Break that promise, and you're no longer our father."

Without another word, he tugged Sophia upstairs.

Diana watched their retreating figures, lips curling into a bitter smile. "That boy..."

Daniel exhaled heavily. "You're really sending Serena to Europe?"

"Of course." Diana's smile was deceptively sweet. "Our parents spoiled her rotten. She dropped out after middle school. A strict boarding school will do her good—teach her discipline, maybe even some manners."

Daniel nodded slowly. "You've thought this through."

It was the perfect solution—sparing her parents' feelings while ensuring Serena couldn't cause more trouble.

But nothing could undo the damage done to Liam and Sophia.

Back in the bedroom,

Sophia slammed the door, tears streaming down her face. "Why did you stop me? She's letting Serena go on purpose! I could've threatened her—made her change her mind!"

"Sophia."

Liam's jaw clenched. "We already forced her to release Mom. Now she holds all the cards. We can't risk it."

Sophia bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. "So we just let Serena walk free?"

"Not exactly."

A dangerous glint flashed in Liam's eyes.

"Remember—once she's in Europe, she'll be in Godfather Nathan Pierce's territory."

Sophia's tears stopped instantly. A slow, vengeful smile spread across her face.

Willowbrook Penitentiary

Evelyn sat motionless on the stiff prison cot, hollow eyes fixed on the narrow window.

That morning, they'd dragged her into interrogation. Hours of threats. Insults. Psychological torture.

No physical violence—just words sharp enough to flay her soul.

A single day had felt like an eternity.

She didn't know how much longer she could endure. How long before she either broke—or died.

Across the cell, Serena hummed cheerfully while folding her clothes.

"See anything interesting out there?" she taunted, glancing at Evelyn's lifeless form.

Evelyn didn't respond.

"I'm leaving soon." Serena held up a silk blouse with a smirk. "Packing my things."

Evelyn's fingers twitched. "You're being released?"

"Obviously." Serena's laugh was like shattered glass. "Bet you didn't see this coming, did you? You put me in here, but now I'm walking out while you rot."

She leaned in, voice dripping with malice. "Still confused? Wonder where Diana got all that dirt on you?"

A theatrical yawn. "She came to me first—before you, before our parents. The second she heard I was locked up? Paid me a visit. We made a deal."

Serena's grin turned feral.

"I told her everything about you. And those brats of yours."
###Chapter 246

"In exchange, she promised to release me."

Evelyn's face drained of color in an instant.

She had fought so hard, finally putting Serena behind bars.

Yet the moment Diana appeared, all her efforts turned to dust.

"I told you, you're not clever enough," Serena taunted, whistling. "You erased every trace of Evelyn Carter, refusing to claim your identity. If you don't want to be Evelyn Carter, plenty would gladly take your place. Now Diana Hart has stolen your name, and you can't prove who you really are. Tell me, isn't that pathetic?"

She stretched lazily. "All those months you spent scheming to lock me up—wasted. A few sweet words in his ear, and I walk free."

A smirk curled her lips. "Do you think they slept together when she made her request?"

Evelyn's chest tightened. The pain was sharp.

But she forced a cold smile. "What does it matter? He's been with countless women."

Serena hesitated. She had been about to say Daniel had only ever been with Evelyn Carter—

Then she reconsidered. Why tell her the truth?

She shrugged. "You're right. I had him too. Such a shame."

Disgust coiled in Evelyn's stomach.

She turned away, giving Serena nothing but the cold line of her back.

Just then, the cell door clicked open.

The warden stepped in, frowning. "You're free to go."

Serena brightened. "Just me?"

The warden glanced at Evelyn. "Both of you."

Serena scoffed. "Seems those brats are smarter than I thought."

Changed out of their prison uniforms, the two women walked down the dim corridor.

Serena's voice dripped venom. "Who knew you'd walk out with me?"

What a waste. She had paid off every guard and inmate in this place to make Evelyn's life hell.

Evelyn kept her gaze ahead, refusing to acknowledge her.

Diana Hart had appeared out of nowhere, unraveling everything.

She had stolen Evelyn's identity, undone all her work—freeing Serena.

Now? Getting Serena to pay for her crimes would be harder than teaching pigs to fly.

The thought sent waves of despair crashing through her.

Outside, the night was thick and heavy.

Two cars waited by the station.

One belonged to Richard and Victoria. The other to Grace and Benjamin.

Evelyn and Serena stepped out, one after the other.

"Dad! Mom!"

Serena sprinted toward them the second the doors opened.

"I missed you so much!"

Victoria and Richard enveloped her in a tight embrace. "Our precious girl..."

The three clung to each other, tears flowing freely.

Evelyn watched, face blank, as they basked in their reunion.

She was part of this family too.

But standing there, watching them, the memories of their time as a family of four felt like someone else's life.

Maybe she should have realized sooner.

Hope for love like that was foolish.

As she stood frozen, Serena turned and flashed her a chilling grin.

"Ms. Carter, our game is far from over."

Victoria scowled, shooting Evelyn a look of pure disdain before soothing Serena.

"Why waste words on someone so heartless?"
###Chapter 247

The icy wind whipped around Evelyn as she watched the three members of the Hart family disappear into their luxury car.

From childhood, Serena had always been the golden child who soaked up all their parents' affection. Not a single drop had ever fallen on Evelyn.

"Evelyn!"

Grace's voice snapped her out of her thoughts. The woman was already rushing toward her with concern in her eyes.

"Are you alright?"
"I'll survive."

Grace linked arms with her warmly. "Come on, let's get you some hot soup at my place."

Benjamin's car was warm compared to the winter chill outside. During the drive, Grace kept chattering about the strange coincidences of the day.

That pregnancy test misunderstanding between her and Benjamin had somehow led to his promotion at work.

Evelyn gazed out the window, the memories flooding back.

Last night had been the first time in six years she'd slept with Daniel.

Yet no pregnancy resulted. The bitter disappointment sat like a stone in her chest.

Now with this Diana Hart imposter appearing, the chances of ever carrying Daniel's child again seemed impossibly slim.

Soon they arrived at Grace's apartment.

Benjamin helped prepare the soup pot before excusing himself. "I'll leave you ladies to catch up properly."

The moment the door clicked shut behind him, Grace grabbed Evelyn's hands urgently. "When Victor called saying you were at the police station, I nearly had a heart attack! What's this about a doppelgänger?"

"Someone wants to steal the title of Mrs. Blackwood."

Evelyn sighed and recounted the recent bizarre events.

Grace's hand flew to her mouth. "Dear God, this is insane!"

She squeezed Evelyn's hand tightly. "Victor said he'll handle things at Silvercrest Manor. Oliver and Emily will be fine. Stay with me for now."

"Thanks." Evelyn drained her wine glass in one go.

Recognizing her friend's dark mood, Grace matched her drink for drink without comment.

Soon Grace was thoroughly intoxicated.

Tears soaked through Grace's blouse as Evelyn leaned heavily against her.

"I just want to save Oliver. To give my children and myself a decent life. Why is everything so hard? Why can't I make Serena and Daniel pay?"

Grace held her tightly. "It'll work out."

She comforted Evelyn until midnight when exhaustion finally claimed her friend.

After turning off the lights, Grace began clearing the wine glasses from the coffee table.

Taking the trash downstairs, she nearly dropped the bag when she spotted Daniel leaning against his car, smoking.

He didn't notice her at first, lost in thought as he exhaled smoke into the cold air.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

He turned, recognizing her, and took another elegant drag. "Still awake?"

Grace noted the dozen cigarette butts at his feet.

"Shouldn't you be home with your beloved wife right now? What brings you here?"

Daniel gave a humorless smile. "Couldn't sleep."

After six years of longing, the woman he'd mourned had miraculously returned. By all rights, he should be sleeping soundly with Diana in his arms.

Yet sleep eluded him.

Six years of grief had carved his love for her into his very bones. Yet whenever he tried to be intimate with Diana, his body rebelled instinctively.

Worse, when holding her, all he could think about was Evelyn.

After hours of trying, he'd finally left Diana alone in their bed, claiming urgent business.

Somehow his car had brought him here.

He crushed the cigarette underfoot. "Where's Evelyn?"

He'd watched from a distance as she got into Benjamin's car after leaving the police station.
###Chapter 248

"She was upset, so she drank herself into oblivion and passed out."

Daniel Blackwood's expression darkened.

After a brief pause, he exhaled sharply. "That makes sense."

The two children she had devoted six years of her life to raising were now suddenly back with their biological parents. Of course she'd struggle to accept it.

"Mr. Blackwood." Grace Thornton crossed her arms. "Mind if I ask you something?"

"Go ahead."

"You've been publicly declaring your love for your wife, swearing you'd bring her home and cherish her forever. But now that she's actually back, you're here in the middle of the night. Have you… developed feelings for Evelyn?"

Grace smirked as she waited for his reaction.

Daniel let out a dry chuckle. "That's quite the joke, Ms. Thornton." His lips curled into a faint, humorless smile. "I'm merely showing concern. After all, she did raise my children for years."

Grace rolled her eyes. "Sure, keep telling yourself that. I'm heading back up. You should leave before someone gets the wrong idea."

Once back in the apartment, Grace couldn't resist glancing out the window before climbing into bed.

Daniel was still there, lighting another cigarette.

She shook her head. Men.

The next morning, Evelyn Carter groaned as her phone blared beside her ear.

The call was from Cassandra Montgomery.

Once the proud and arrogant Design Director, Cassandra was now Evelyn's assistant.

Her voice dripped with forced cheerfulness. "Director, you haven’t been to the office in two days. Will you be coming in today? The design department is eagerly awaiting your guidance on the new project."

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "I thought I was fired?"

"Fired?" Cassandra let out an awkward laugh. "You must be joking. Someone of your reputation, personally appointed by Mr. Blackwood's father—who would dare fire you?"

Evelyn sat up slowly, her mind still foggy. "I'll be in today."

If she wasn't fired, she still had a job to do.

This was the only thread still connecting her to Daniel.

Not that she cared about him.

But…

With Serena and Liam now back in Daniel and Diana's lives, she needed any excuse to stay close.

Taking a deep breath, she forced herself out of bed and into the shower.

Grace leaned against the bathroom door, yawning. "Guess who I saw last night after you passed out?"

Evelyn paused mid-rinse. "Who?"

"Daniel Blackwood."

Her hands stilled under the water.

A beat later, she scoffed. "Not funny."

"I'm serious." Grace smirked. "Think about it. Six years ago, Daniel never really loved you—it was all an act. Now Diana Hart stole your identity and waltzed back into his life. The first thing she did was kick you and Serena out. If I were Daniel, I'd despise her too. No way would I be playing happy family."

Evelyn turned off the water and reached for a towel. "And?"

Grace grinned. "I'm saying you still have a shot. Seduce him. Get what you need, then disappear. It's not like you plan to stick around forever."

Evelyn sighed. "We'll talk later."

Her thoughts were too jumbled for this conversation.

After getting ready, Evelyn slung her bag over her shoulder and headed downstairs.

The moment she stepped outside, she was ambushed.

Reporters swarmed her instantly.

"Ms. Carter, why are you staying here instead of Silvercrest Manor?"

"Ms. Carter, is it true Diana Hart has returned as Mr. Blackwood's wife? What are your plans now?"

"Has Mr. Blackwood discarded you?"

"You were dumped right after going public with your relationship. Do you still intend to work at Blackwood Enterprises?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw and pushed through the crowd without a word.

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn’t Easy
###Chapter 249

Cameras flashed in Evelyn Carter's face as she stepped out of Grace Thornton's apartment building. The swarm of reporters caught her completely off guard.

Her fingers tightened around her purse strap. How did they find her here?

Only a handful of people knew she'd stayed overnight at Grace's place - the Blackwood family outside the police station, Daniel, Grace, and Grace's boyfriend.

Daniel wouldn't stoop to this level of humiliation. That left only one culprit.

Serena Hart.

Evelyn's lips curled in a bitter smile. Her dear sister wasted no time causing trouble after being released. Such dedication.

With practiced ease, she swept her hair back and faced the reporters. "You're asking the wrong person. Shouldn't these questions be directed at Mr. Blackwood? I merely confirmed our relationship status when his ex-wife returned. Whether we separate or I remain at Blackwood Corporation - those are his decisions. Would you like his address?"

Her composed demeanor and sharp rebuttal silenced the crowd.

"If there's nothing else, I have work to attend to."

She strode through the gaping reporters with her head held high.

Inside the taxi, her phone vibrated. Daniel's name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn hesitated before answering.

"I saw the news." His voice was ice. "Ethan's handling it."

A humorless smile touched her lips. "How generous of you, Mr. Blackwood."

The line went quiet for several heartbeats.

"I came by last night. Grace said you were sleeping."

She turned toward the window. "Say whatever you need to say now."

A faint sigh crackled through the receiver. "With Diana's return, our arrangement ends. Thank you for caring for Emily and Liam these years. Diana and I will take over their care. For their emotional wellbeing... it's best you don't see them anymore. Children adapt quickly. They'll learn to accept Diana as their mother. Your position at Blackwood Corporation remains unchanged, though you're relieved from tutoring Emily. We'll hire someone new."

Evelyn's grip turned white-knuckled around the phone. The absurdity of the situation nearly made her laugh.

She'd only returned for Daniel's genetic material to cure Oliver's illness.

Now fate had twisted her into some kidnapper stepmother figure.

And she was being forced to abandon the children she'd raised for six years.

Her eyes fluttered shut. After a long pause, she whispered, "Understood."

The call ended. She brushed away traitorous tears.

That morning, she'd received voice messages from Emily and Liam. The thoughtful children had recorded lengthy messages to cheer her up.

Their kindness only made the pain sharper.

She'd failed as a mother.

Such a simple plan, yet she'd ruined everything.

And Serena still walked free.

At Blackwood Corporation, whispers followed her everywhere.

She knew what they said. What they laughed about. None of it mattered now.

She had to stay - for Oliver's sake.

Work became her refuge. She buried herself in files until her vision blurred.

Exhausted, she trudged toward the bus stop that evening.

A sleek car pulled up beside her. The window lowered, revealing Serena's smug face. "Leaving for Europe tomorrow. Care for a farewell coffee?"

Evelyn didn't break stride. "I'd rather drink poison."
###Chapter 250

"You don't care, even if it's about your true origins?"

"What origins?"

"I knew that would get your attention."

Serena smirked. "Get in. I won't bite."

She led Evelyn to a nearby café. "Talk."

Evelyn sank into the chair, inhaling sharply as her icy gaze locked onto the woman across from her.

Serena took a slow sip of her coffee. "I thought you might need a moment to process..."

Then she set the cup down. "When I said I wanted to discuss your birth, did you assume you might not be Mom and Dad's real daughter?" Evelyn's frown deepened, but she remained silent.

"Understandable. They've always treated you like an outsider. But the truth is the exact opposite."

Serena leaned back, stretching comfortably against the sofa. "I'm not their biological child."

Evelyn's grip on her cup froze mid-air.

After a long pause, she finally spoke. "That's impossible..."

Their parents had doted on Serena—buying her designer clothes, lavish gifts. Evelyn, the older sister, had only ever received hand-me-downs.

And now Serena claimed she wasn't even their real daughter?

"I'm not completely unrelated to them."

Serena traced the rim of her cup with a polished fingernail. "I'm Dad's biological child. Same father, different mothers. When he had his affair, my mother and Victoria got pregnant at the same time. My mother left him during the pregnancy. She never wanted me. So Dad made sure I wouldn't suffer. He switched me with your real sister. I became the second daughter of the Sinclair family, while your blood sister was sent to an orphanage."

Evelyn sat rigid, a sudden chill creeping through her veins.

Serena—the girl Victoria had loved and protected all these years—was the product of Richard's infidelity?

Evelyn bit her lip hard. "Serena, you can't just drop this bombshell without proof."

"You don't believe me?"

With a sly smile, Serena slid two DNA reports across the table.

One compared her to Victoria.

The other to another woman.

The results were clear: Serena was not Victoria's daughter, but the other woman's.

She took another elegant sip. "I'm leaving for Europe tomorrow to meet my birth mother. Thought you should know the truth before I go."

Evelyn stared at the documents, her lips pressed into a thin line.

"Then where is my real sister?"

Serena shrugged. "How should I know? I'm not omniscient."

She stood. "If that's all, I'll take my leave. Goodbye, dear sister. Don't expect to see me again."

Evelyn remained seated, watching Serena walk away, emotions churning inside her.

Her father had cheated.

Serena wasn't her sister. So where was the real one?

Suddenly, an image flashed in her mind—the mysterious woman named Diana, who had recently entered their lives.

Could it be...?

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn't Easy
###Chapter 251

Evelyn stepped out of the coffee shop and headed straight for the farmers' market.

Grace had never been much of a cook, so ever since they started living together, Evelyn naturally took over grocery shopping and meal prep.

Bags in hand, she paused at the front door, keys in her grasp, when Grace's flustered voice drifted through.

"Evelyn will be back any minute, Benjamin, stop—"

"In a way, she's practically our matchmaker. She won't mind."

"She's been in a terrible mood lately. Things haven’t been easy for her. Don’t make it worse."

"Then we should hurry before she gets here."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the keys.

Terrible timing.

She set the groceries down by the door, exhaled sharply, and turned on her heel.

Night had fallen over Willowbrook, the city alive with neon lights.

Evelyn wandered aimlessly for what felt like hours.

Somehow, her feet carried her to the entrance of an art gallery.

Her gaze flicked to the display board: Renowned Artist Theodore Allen’s Exhibition: Willowbrook Stop.

Theodore Allen had been her idol back in her student days.

A younger, more naive Evelyn had once scribbled in her diary: Life goal: Attend at least one Theodore Allen exhibition.

Years had passed. After everything she’d been through, standing here now, she felt… nothing.

Still, she bought a ticket and stepped inside.

It had been a dream, once.

The gallery was quiet, nearly empty.

As she moved through the halls, each painting brought back memories of her reckless youth.

A bitter laugh escaped her.

"Daniel, thank you. I’m so glad I finally got to see Theodore Allen’s work."

"I’m happy I could make it happen for you."

A woman’s voice snapped Evelyn back to the present.

She turned toward the sound.

There, in a flowing white dress, stood Diana Hart—arm linked with Daniel’s—strolling right toward her.

They looked perfect together.

And suddenly, Evelyn understood why that voice had sounded so familiar.

It was exactly how she used to sound.

This woman didn’t just look like the old Evelyn. She sounded like her too.

Serena’s words from earlier echoed in her mind. "He quietly switched me with your real sister. I became the second Hart daughter, while your sister was sent to an orphanage."

Her brow furrowed.

Was Diana that sister?

If so… everything made sense.

"Evelyn?"

She blinked. Diana and Daniel were standing right in front of her now.

Diana clung to Daniel’s arm, all smiles. "What a surprise, running into you here!"

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Yes, quite the coincidence. You’re a fan of Theodore Allen too?"

Diana beamed. "Oh, yes. Daniel knew how much I loved his work, so as soon as I returned, he pulled some strings and arranged this whole exhibition."

She nuzzled against Daniel’s chest. "My husband is amazing."

Watching Diana—wearing her old face—fawn over Daniel twisted something inside Evelyn.

Should she be happy? Because Daniel finally loved the real Evelyn Hart.

Or devastated? Because the woman he loved now was nothing but a fraud.

Unless… this was all an act.

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly. "Then I should thank Mrs. Blackwood. Because of you, Willowbrook gets to experience Theodore Allen’s genius firsthand."

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn’t Easy
###Chapter 252

Evelyn Carter gestured toward the painting behind her with a knowing smile. "Mrs. Blackwood, do you recognize this piece?"

Diana Hart barely suppressed an eye roll.

Was this woman seriously testing her?

She answered dismissively, "It's called The Act—a commentary on people who perform for others just to show off."

Evelyn's lips curved. "How fitting for you."

Diana froze, realization dawning.

Evelyn was mocking her—accusing her of putting on a performance!

Fury burned through her. She clutched Daniel Blackwood's arm. "Darling, she's implying we don't love each other. Kiss me. Prove her wrong."

Daniel tensed, his muscles locking under her grip.

Running into Evelyn here was already uncomfortable. Now Diana wanted him to put on a romantic display in front of her?

And kiss her?

His brow furrowed. "Don't be ridiculous."

Since Diana had returned, he had considered kissing her.

But every time he got close, his body recoiled on instinct.

He'd even seen a therapist about it.

The explanation? Emotional distance. Their minds might still love each other, but their bodies had become strangers.

If he couldn't kiss her in private, how could he possibly do it here?

"I'm not being ridiculous." Diana seized the moment, determined to force his hand. "You don't love me anymore, do you?"

Daniel exhaled sharply. "I don't need to prove my love for you in front of outsiders."

The word outsiders twisted like a knife in Evelyn's chest.

But Diana wasn't satisfied. She bit her lip. "I want you to."

Before he could react, she rose onto her toes, arms looping around his neck, lips puckered—

Evelyn stood frozen, watching as her heart shattered.

Diana looked just like her in the past.

To the world, Daniel was the doting husband, indulging his wife's every whim.

But in reality? He couldn't even bring himself to kiss her.

Their lips inched closer.

Evelyn knew she should look away.

But she couldn't.

Her gaze stayed locked on them, the pain in her chest swelling until it was unbearable—

Just before their lips met, Daniel's phone rang.

The sound snapped him out of it. He shoved Diana away and turned to answer.

Diana's teeth ground together. So close. She'd been so close.

"Looks like your little act failed, Mrs. Blackwood."

Evelyn's voice was ice. She cast Diana one last scathing look before turning to leave. "Next time, rehearse your performance with Mr. Blackwood before staging it for me."

The taunt made Diana's nails dig into her palms.

Her eyes flicked up to the security camera overhead. A dark glint flashed in them.

The second Evelyn stepped into the camera's blind spot—

Diana lunged.

Evelyn barely had time to react before she was slammed into the wall. Instinctively, her hand shot out to brace herself—

Right through Theodore Allen's masterpiece, The Kite and The Maiden.

The priceless canvas tore with a sickening riiiip.
###Chapter 253

"Oh my god..."

Evelyn's finger punctured the canvas with a soft tear. Diana gasped dramatically, "This is Mr. Allen's most prized artwork! Evelyn, even if you despise me, must you ruin something I admire?"

The dimly lit corner of the exhibition hall had concealed their altercation until Diana's shrill accusation drew every eye in the room.

Before Evelyn could steady herself, the whispers began.

"Barbaric behavior at an art exhibition!"

"Master Allen rejected a ten-million-dollar offer for that piece!"

"Can she possibly compensate for this?"

"Petty jealousy makes women vicious."

Evelyn tuned out the murmurs, focusing on the jagged hole in the canvas. She'd underestimated Diana Hart. The woman wasn't just patient—she was diabolically cunning.

"Miss Carter." The manager's voice cut through the noise. "You'll face consequences for damaging Master Allen's work. Choose: financial compensation, replacement, or legal action."

Evelyn met his gaze. "What if I told you this wasn't vandalism?"

Diana tittered. "She destroyed it out of spite. What other explanation could exist?" Then, with feigned magnanimity: "Though perhaps we should review security footage to be fair."

The surveillance room revealed their first complication. "The camera angle missed that display area," the technician admitted, then brightened. "But there was a witness—a man watching the entire incident!"

"Bring him immediately," the manager ordered.

Diana's nails dug into her palms. She'd ensured no cameras, no witnesses when she shoved Evelyn. How—?

"This is unreliable," she interjected. "People lie. What if he's her accomplice?"

The manager studied the monitor. "This witness won't lie." He pointed. "Mrs. Blackwood, isn't this your husband?"

Diana's blood ran cold. The screen clearly showed Daniel Blackwood's unmistakable profile.
###Chapter 254

The phone was pressed to his ear as he stood in the corner of the second floor.

His gaze was fixed in the exact direction where Evelyn had pushed Diana.

Evelyn's face drained of color instantly.

"Mr. Blackwood is our sponsor, and as your husband, he would undoubtedly remain impartial," the manager said firmly before turning to a subordinate. "Go and fetch Mr. Blackwood immediately."

Evelyn's expression twisted with regret.

Daniel had seen her shove Diana.

She had only just returned to his side, and he still had his doubts about her. If he realized she wasn’t the gentle, kind woman she pretended to be…

Would he start questioning everything?

"Ms. Carter," the manager addressed her coolly. "Whether you destroyed the painting intentionally or were framed, the truth will come out once Mr. Blackwood arrives."

Evelyn clenched her fists at her sides.

Diana had set her up, accusing her of ruining Mr. Allen’s artwork. She had planned to clear her name with the CCTV footage and witness testimonies.

But the painting had been in a blind spot.

And worse—Daniel was the only witness.

She shut her eyes briefly.

Would he… actually tell the truth to help her?

"Mr. Blackwood, this way, please."

The sycophantic voice of a staff member announced his arrival.

The tall, impeccably dressed man strode into the surveillance room.

His sharp eyes flicked between Diana and Evelyn, immediately grasping the situation.

Without hesitation, he pulled out a checkbook and wrote a ten-million-dollar check. "Give this to Mr. Allen. If it’s insufficient, my secretary will handle additional compensation. I’ll cover the cost of the painting."

The room erupted in murmurs.

The manager frowned. "Mr. Blackwood, we called you here to testify—"

Daniel’s icy stare silenced him instantly. "I said I’m reimbursing Mr. Allen for the painting."

The manager swallowed his words under that glacial gaze.

He couldn’t afford to cross Daniel Blackwood.

All he wanted was someone to take responsibility for the loss.

Now that Daniel was willing to pay, there was no need to pursue the culprit.

He bowed his head hastily. "Of course, Mr. Blackwood. Thank you for your time."

Daniel exhaled dismissively before turning to Diana.

Under his piercing stare, she lowered her eyes, unable to meet his gaze.

With a quiet sigh, he slid an arm around her waist. "Let’s go."

Then he guided her past Evelyn without so much as a glance.

Evelyn stood frozen, her heart twisting painfully.

She should have known he would protect Diana.

For a fleeting moment, she had actually hoped he might speak the truth—might defend her.

"Mr. Blackwood."

A smooth, amused voice stopped him at the door.

The crowd turned.

"Master Allen?"

The artist waved off their attention, his smirk directed at Daniel’s retreating figure. "Your wife destroyed my painting. Besides money, doesn’t she owe me an apology?"

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn’t Easy
###Chapter 255

Daniel froze mid-step.

He turned sharply, his icy gaze locking onto the man behind him. "Mr. Allen, you seem to be mistaken..."

Beside him, the manager rushed forward. "The person who damaged your painting was Ms. Evelyn, not Mrs. Blackwood."

Theodore's lips curved into a knowing smile as he glanced toward Evelyn. "Why didn't you tell them you were framed? Just because he paid ten million for you?"

Evelyn's face drained of color.

Her eyes darted between Theodore and Daniel.

The latter's expression remained unreadable. "Because no one would take my side."

After a beat, Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting Daniel's gaze head-on. "No surveillance footage exists. The sole witness refused to speak. No matter what I say, no one will believe me."

"Why wouldn't they believe you?"

Theodore chuckled, closing the distance between them. His clear eyes challenged Daniel. "Mr. Blackwood, as the only witness, shouldn't you clarify who actually destroyed my painting? Monetary compensation alone doesn't satisfy me—I cherished that piece."

Daniel's grip around Diana's waist tightened. "Does it matter?"

"Immensely."

Theodore's gentle demeanor hardened. An unspoken challenge passed between the two men.

The air in the room grew thick with tension.

Finally, Daniel smirked. "Truthfully..."

His gaze shifted to Evelyn. "I didn't see who damaged your painting."

The manager blinked. "But your staff claimed—"

"Since when does standing somewhere mean I witnessed anything?" Daniel's voice turned glacial. "I could've been daydreaming."

Murmurs erupted through the crowd.

Evelyn stood rooted, her heart plummeting.

She knew Daniel had seen everything.

His deliberate evasion proved it.

He'd chosen to lie. For Diana.

Closing her eyes, she felt the last shred of hope for him shatter.

"I'm paying because this involves two people under my responsibility—my wife and my employee." Daniel's voice cut through the whispers. "As both husband and employer, I'm ending this farce."

His cold stare returned to Theodore. "Satisfied?"

Theodore smiled. "Perfectly."

Then he turned to Evelyn, whose cheeks still lacked color. "I hear you're an admirer of my work. Care to view the remaining pieces with me?"

Evelyn's head jerked up, meeting his warm gaze.

After a pause, she nodded. "I'd love to."

Theodore, a celebrated artist of Daniel's generation, had been Evelyn's idol since his early exhibitions.

When he extended his hand, she couldn't refuse.

"Shall we?"

Theodore's fingers closed around hers. Instinct made her stiffen, but instead of pulling away, she tightened her grip.

His eyebrows rose slightly before he chuckled. "Let's go."

As they exited, the manager began dispersing the crowd. "Show's over, folks."

"Danny, let's leave." Diana's voice dripped honey as she clung to Daniel's arm.
###Chapter 256

Daniel's eyes followed Evelyn and Theodore as they walked away, their fingers still entwined. They'd only just met, yet they moved with the easy intimacy of longtime lovers.

His jaw tightened involuntarily.

"D-Daniel... You really didn't see anything?" Diana's hesitant voice broke through his thoughts as they descended the stairs, her grip on his arm tightening.

His gaze remained fixed ahead. "What do you think?"

She worried her lower lip between her teeth before speaking. "The truth is, I—"

"I know." His interruption came softly but firmly. "I know you're trying to get back at Evelyn for taking the children. But this ends tonight, Diana."

A heavy sigh escaped him. "If you still held resentment, you shouldn't have asked me to release her. Now that she's free, this isn't how we handle things." His voice carried quiet authority.

Diana's teeth sank deeper into her lip. "Fine. It won't happen again."

Next time, she'd be more discreet.

Daniel recognized the pout forming on her face. He exhaled and gave her hand a reassuring pat. "You're better than this. The Diana I remember wouldn't stoop to petty revenge."

They emerged into the crisp night air. Daniel tilted his head back, taking in the glittering skyline. "Ethan will drive you home."

A petulant note entered Diana's voice. "Another late night at the office?"

"Mmm." He massaged his temples, weariness evident. "International conference call with the Tokyo branch."

"That's three nights this week." Her fingers tightened around his sleeve in protest. "We've barely had time together since I came back..."

"We have our whole lives ahead of us." His hand brushed through her hair before signaling to a figure across the street.

Ethan pulled up in the sleek black sedan. "Mrs. Blackwood?"

With obvious reluctance, Diana slid into the leather seat. "Don't work too late, darling."

Daniel gave a noncommittal nod. "Get some rest."

As the taillights disappeared around the corner, an unfamiliar ache settled in his chest.

This wasn't the Evelyn he knew.

No matter how deep her anger ran, she'd never deface artwork—especially not Theodore Allen's masterpiece. 'The Kite and The Maiden' had been her favorite painting since college.

Six years. Had time truly changed her so completely?

"I've admired your work since your first exhibition! Your brushwork is revolutionary!" The familiar lilt of Evelyn's voice snapped him back to the present.

Daniel turned to see her walking beside Theodore, her white sundress fluttering in the evening breeze. Streetlights caught the genuine awe in her expression as she spoke animatedly about color theory.

Theodore chuckled. "Such praise from a talented artist herself is humbling." He checked his watch. "It's getting late—allow me to drive you home?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to refuse when movement caught her eye. There, beneath a flickering lamp post, stood Daniel.

Motionless. Watching. Even from this distance, she could feel the weight of his gaze.

Her refusal died on her lips. "That would be lovely, thank you."

Daniel watched Theodore's convertible pull away, his fingers twitching toward his cigarette case. After three quick drags, he stubbed it out violently and slid behind the wheel of his own car.

The engine roared to life as he turned onto the same road.
###Chapter 257

Evelyn Carter gazed out the car window, fingers tapping absently against her knee. "Just out of curiosity," she mused, "how did you know I wasn't the one who destroyed your painting?"

Theodore Allen's grip on the steering wheel loosened slightly as he smirked. "What if I told you I don't believe Evelyn Carter is the type to do something like that?"

She stiffened for half a second before letting out a soft laugh. "Mr. Allen knows me that well?"

"I dabbled in jewelry design once," he admitted, eyes still on the road. "Gave up after realizing how brutal the industry was. But during that time, I studied a lot of designers—including you. Calling you a legend in the field wouldn’t be an exaggeration."

Evelyn blinked, processing his words. It made sense now. If he hadn’t recognized her as the renowned designer, he wouldn’t have stepped in to help her earlier—let alone offer her a ride home.

A faint smile curved her lips. "Small world."

"Lucky for me," Theodore said, voice smooth as silk. "Though that wasn’t the only reason I knew you didn’t ruin my work."

She turned her head slightly, studying his profile.

"The painting you supposedly destroyed?" He chuckled. "It was a fake."

Evelyn’s brows lifted.

"I have a habit of displaying replicas of my own pieces in blind spots," he explained. "Each one has a hidden camera inside. I like seeing people’s unfiltered reactions to my art."

Her breath hitched. "So you saw everything?"

"Every second." The car rolled to a stop. "We’re here."

Evelyn glanced outside—Grace Thornton’s apartment building. She unbuckled her seatbelt. "Thanks for the ride. I’d invite you up, but my roommate wouldn’t appreciate unexpected guests."

Theodore stepped out as well, handing her a sleek business card and a velvet-wrapped box. "I’d love the chance to know you better, Ms. Carter."

She hesitated but took them. "The pleasure would be mine."

He grinned, nudging the box into her palm. "Open it later. If you don’t like it, just return it." With that, he slid back into the car and gave her a casual wave before driving off.

Evelyn stood frozen for a moment, exhaling slowly before shoving both items into her purse and heading inside.

The stairwell was pitch black. The second she stepped in, a strong hand yanked her into the shadows. She barely had time to gasp before she was pinned against the wall.

The glow of a cigarette illuminated sharp features.

Daniel Blackwood.

He took a slow drag, exhaling smoke through his nose. His voice was ice. "You’ve known him for an hour, and you’re already letting him drive you home? Accepting gifts?"

Her pulse spiked. "Were you following me?"

Daniel ignored the question. His gaze was razor-sharp. "Feeling lonely now that the kids are gone? Is that why you’re throwing yourself at the first man who looks your way?"

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "What I do is none of your business, Daniel. The only connection we have left is professional. Does Blackwood Enterprises make a habit of stalking its employees?"

He paused, taking another drag before speaking again, voice low. "Consider this a warning—don’t trust strangers."

Theodore had held her hand, driven her home, given her a gift—all within hours. Daniel’s instincts screamed that the man had an agenda.

And Evelyn was walking right into it.
###Chapter 258

"Not everyone deserves your trust..." Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Wise words. But the world's full of professional deceivers. Some so convincing they could swear on their mother's grave while staring straight into your eyes."

She lifted her chin defiantly to meet Daniel's gaze. "Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel's jaw tightened. The silence stretched between them before he finally admitted, "I regret what happened earlier. But Diana—"

"Save it." Evelyn cut him off, years of pent-up fury boiling over. "We both know why. Your precious wife can do no wrong in your eyes, can she? I'll never understand you, Daniel."

"Serena Hart gave up everything for you. What did she get in return?" Her voice trembled. "Waiting up till dawn every night. Enduring your family's cruelty without complaint. Turning down that scholarship to Paris—all for you. And how did you repay her? With indifference. Now you play doting husband to Diana? Defending her lies? Protecting her mistakes?" Evelyn turned away to hide the moisture in her eyes. "It's disgusting."

"You're right about today." Daniel exhaled sharply. "Liam and Emily refuse to accept Diana as their mother. She acted out of jealousy—because they clearly prefer you."

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh. "They'll never accept her." Her children would never call another woman 'Mom.'

"She's still their biological mother," Daniel countered. "We'll earn their trust back. This won't happen again."

Evelyn's icy stare pinned him. "How can you promise that? Will you keep covering for her? Like today?"

Daniel's eyes flashed with irritation. "I said it ends here."

"Better hope so." With a scoff, Evelyn moved to leave, but Daniel grabbed her wrist. "Stay away from Theodore Allen."

She wrenched free. "He's a brilliant artist and I'm his chosen designer. Our relationship is none of your concern! Why don't you go lecture your lying wife instead?"

The elevator doors slid shut on Daniel's stony expression. The irony wasn't lost on her.

Back in her apartment, Evelyn found Grace asleep, a covered plate waiting on the table. After reheating the meal, she opened Theodore's parting gift—a sleek USB drive.

Frowning, she carried her food to the bedroom and plugged it into her laptop. The single video file made her breath catch.

Security footage. Dated six years ago.

The images made her blood run cold.
###Chapter 259

The security footage clearly showed Diana attempting to frame her. Every damning detail was captured in perfect clarity - Diana's face fully visible, her actions unmistakable, even her voice recorded with crystal precision.

Evelyn blinked at her laptop screen, then suddenly remembered Theodore's words from before.

'I install replicas of my own artwork in surveillance blind spots. But these pieces contain hidden cameras.'

"Evelyn! Evelyn!"

At seven sharp, Grace's persistent knocking dragged Evelyn from sleep. She rubbed her eyes, stumbling toward the door. "What's happening?"

After sending the incriminating video to Oliver last night, their lengthy phone conversation had lasted until 2 AM. Five hours of sleep wasn't nearly enough.

"There's a man here for you! Theodore something. Says he's taking you to breakfast before work!"

Evelyn's sleepiness vanished instantly. "Theodore?"

"Some artist type," Grace confirmed through the door.

Evelyn rushed through her morning routine. Emerging from her room, she found Theodore - dressed entirely in white - conversing with Benjamin on the sofa. His face lit up when he saw her. "Morning, sunshine."

"Good morning," Evelyn mumbled, cheeks warming.

He checked his watch with effortless grace. "Blackwood Corporation clocks in at 8:30. It's 7:20 now, thirty minutes to their headquarters... which leaves us forty minutes for breakfast." Rising smoothly, he extended his hand. "Shall we?"

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn said goodbye to Grace and followed him out.

Soon they sat in a café near Blackwood Tower. Evelyn stirred her oatmeal absently. "I didn't expect you to... you know, pick me up for work." She offered an awkward smile. "This is..."

"Too soon?" Theodore's lips curved knowingly. "You'll adjust."

Evelyn set down her spoon, meeting his gaze seriously. "I'm engaged."

Theodore chuckled. "And how does that affect me wanting to know you better?"

Evelyn had no response. She focused on her breakfast instead.

"Your roommate's boyfriend seems quite comfortable," Theodore remarked casually. "He mentioned you returned last night but left the food at the door. Must be inconvenient having him around constantly."

Evelyn nodded silently. She'd been considering moving out since the fire made her old place uninhabitable. Getting pregnant with Daniel's child would be challenging enough without being a third wheel to Grace and Benjamin.

Theodore produced a brochure from his bag. "I've lived here for years - excellent location. Maybe you'd like to be my neighbor?"

Evelyn skimmed the pamphlet. The luxury apartments were indeed perfect - equidistant between Blackwood Tower and Silvercrest Manor, with top-tier amenities. The rent was steep but manageable with her savings.

"Thanks, I'll think about it." She tucked the brochure away just as the café door chimed.

Evelyn's stomach dropped. Of all the rotten luck - Daniel and Diana strolled in together.

Theodore followed her gaze and waved cheerfully. "Mr. Blackwood! What a coincidence!"

Too engrossed in ordering with Diana, Daniel didn't even glance their way.

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn't Easy novel
###Chapter 260

Daniel turned sharply at the sound of Theodore's voice. His expression darkened the moment his eyes locked with Evelyn and Theodore's.

Diana noticed them too. Her lips pressed into a thin line as she muttered to Daniel, "Look at that. Evelyn and Theodore Allen just met yesterday, and they're already having breakfast together. How cozy."

Daniel frowned at her tone but said nothing. After a beat, he strode over and dropped into the empty seat beside Evelyn. "We're joining you."

Diana had no choice but to follow, though she stiffened when she realized the only remaining seat was next to Theodore. She sat down reluctantly.

Almost immediately, she realized something was off. The café wasn’t crowded—there were plenty of empty tables. They didn’t have to share one with Evelyn and Theodore. And even if they did, Daniel should’ve sat beside her, not Evelyn.

Theodore took a slow sip of his oat milk, amusement dancing in his eyes. "What an interesting group we have here."

Evelyn couldn’t stand being so close to Daniel. She quickly finished her oatmeal and set the bowl down. "I'm done. Mr. Blackwood, if you'll excuse me—"

"Why the rush?" Daniel checked his watch. "You still have half an hour. And even if you're late, your boss is right here. What’s the hurry?"

The waiter arrived with Daniel and Diana’s meals. Daniel began eating with deliberate slowness, his movements refined.

Evelyn arched a brow. "So you're saying I should sit here and watch you eat, and only leave once you're finished?"

"Exactly."

"You—!"

"Evelyn," Theodore cut in smoothly, resting his chin on his hand. "Mr. Blackwood is giving you a free pass. Even if you're late, there won’t be consequences. Why rush?" His gaze softened. "Besides, once you move here, we won’t need to go out for breakfast. I’m a decent cook. Would you like to try my food sometime?"

Evelyn flicked a glance at Daniel, who was chewing with a stormy expression. "Sure. I can cook too—we can take turns."

Thud!

Daniel slammed his glass down hard. The sound cracked through the café like a gunshot, drawing startled looks from nearby patrons.

Diana flinched. "Daniel? Is the food not to your liking?"

He didn’t answer, his jaw tight.

"Should we go somewhere else?" Diana asked nervously. She didn’t want to stay and watch this tension between him and Evelyn.

Theodore smirked, rubbing his chin. "If Mr. Blackwood dislikes café food, why didn’t you cook for him, Mrs. Blackwood? Unless… you don’t know how?"

Diana’s face paled. "Of course I can cook! I just didn’t feel like it today!"

Daniel’s lips twisted into a strained smile. Suddenly, a memory surfaced—Evelyn’s voice, bright and warm.

"I love making you breakfast. It makes me feel so accomplished!"

His chest tightened. Had she really changed that much?

Evelyn tilted her head at Diana. "Don’t you think cooking for your husband would give you that same sense of accomplishment, Mrs. Blackwood?"

Daniel’s head snapped up. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting Evelyn in a golden glow. Her voice, her face—everything was different from six years ago. But the way she said it, the spark in her eyes, that affectionate lilt… it was her.

For a heartbeat, Daniel wondered if he was imagining things.

Chasing My Ex-Wife Back
###Chapter 261

Evelyn Carter rolled her eyes. What was so impressive about cooking breakfast anyway?

Just as she opened her mouth to snap back, she noticed the way Daniel Blackwood was looking at Serena Hart. Warning signals flashed through her mind. That comment had been deliberate!

Evelyn forced a smile. "I used to feel the same way. Something as simple as making breakfast for loved ones could fill me with pride." She sighed dramatically. "But then...I realized I couldn't even protect those closest to me. What kind of person fails at that?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "After that, nothing ever felt meaningful again."

Daniel's attention snapped back to her. The pain in her words struck him deeply. Six years apart - he couldn't begin to fathom what she'd endured.

Though she'd changed from the woman he once loved, guilt twisted in his gut. He shouldn't have doubted her, not even for a second. Especially not because of another woman's words.

Daniel exhaled heavily. "That's all behind us now." He silently vowed to help her rediscover her old self, whatever it took.

Pushing his plate away, Daniel stood. "Let's go."

The warmth in his eyes made Evelyn's heart flutter with victory. She clung to his arm, resting her head against his shoulder. "Should we stop by HR first?"

Daniel smiled down at her. "I'll take you there myself." They turned toward the exit together.

At the doorway, Daniel paused and glanced back at Serena. "My office. Ten o'clock sharp."

Theodore Allen watched the couple disappear, then checked his watch with an amused smirk. "Well that was...brief." He tapped the face. "Still have twenty minutes to kill."

His gaze shifted to Serena. "Why so interested in your boss's personal life?"

Serena laughed lightly. "Isn't employee concern part of good workplace etiquette?"

Theodore rested his chin on one hand. "If you say so."

Eager to change the subject, Serena met his eyes directly. "Actually, I'm a huge admirer of your work. You're known for never staying in one place long - what brought you to Willowbrook?"

Theodore stirred his coffee absently. "That curious about me?"

"Only if you're comfortable sharing."

He gave a humorless chuckle. "Remember that painting Diana tried blaming you for damaging? 'The Kite and The Maiden'?" His expression grew distant. "I saw the scene years ago outside a school - a girl in a white dress chasing a kite. Sunlight made her glow like an angel. I painted it immediately, but when I went back to find her..." He shrugged. "Gone."

Theodore continued, voice softening. "Years later, that painting became my most famous work. The more recognition it got, the more I needed to thank that girl in person. Five years ago, I finally tracked down her name." He locked eyes with Serena. "Evelyn Carter."

Clang!

Serena's spoon clattered against her bowl. She fumbled to retrieve it, hands trembling slightly. "You're...certain?"

"Positive." Theodore yawned, studying her reaction closely. "But when I came to Willowbrook to find her, I discovered she'd died a year earlier."
###Chapter 262

"I even visited her gravesite. When I heard she might still be alive, I rushed back to Willowbrook to investigate. Then Daniel's assistant reached out, offering to host an art exhibition in Diana's honor."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "So... You stayed in Willowbrook just to thank Diana personally?"

She doubted that explanation. Theodore had shown zero interest in speaking with Diana since their first meeting.

"I needed to verify something first." Theodore raised his wine glass, taking a measured sip. "When I thought Evelyn Carter died five years ago, I studied everything about her - social media, blog posts, every digital footprint. The woman with Daniel now? She's not the real Evelyn. Calling herself Diana doesn't change that. The real Evelyn wasn't this shallow, manipulative creature."

His words hit Evelyn like a physical blow. She grabbed her glass, needing the distraction. After composing herself, she managed, "People change."

"Exactly why I'm still investigating." Theodore's gaze sharpened. "Aren't you curious about Diana's true identity?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Of course I am."

Serena's revelation echoed in her mind. Maybe her sister had finally confessed that Diana was Evelyn's twin. Or maybe it was another cruel mind game. Either way, Evelyn would uncover the truth.

Theodore's grin widened. "Seems we share a common interest now."

"You could say that," Evelyn conceded.

She'd suspected Theodore's interest was romantic, but his explanation made things clear. He only sought her connection to the Blackwoods. As an artist, he had no direct access to Daniel or Diana. Evelyn - the ex-girlfriend who worked at Pierce Corporation, the woman Diana had framed last night - was his perfect informant.

Understanding his motives didn't upset her. She'd do the same in his position. They were allies in this strange investigation.

"What if," Evelyn met his gaze, "you confirm Diana isn't Evelyn Carter? Then what?"

Theodore considered this. "I'd leave Willowbrook. Search for the real Evelyn."

"You wouldn't expose the imposter?"

"Why bother?" He chuckled darkly. "If a stranger like me can see through Diana's act, how blind must Daniel be after three years of marriage? If he's that foolish, he deserves the deception."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Theodore was right.

This near-stranger had instantly recognized Diana's fraud. How could Daniel, who'd shared a bed with Evelyn for years, be so utterly clueless?

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn't Easy novel
###Chapter 263

8:29 a.m.

Evelyn Carter walked into the design department with exactly one minute to spare.

Cassandra Montgomery caught her eye and smirked. "You've got a visitor in your office. He's been waiting for a while."

Frowning, Evelyn pushed open her office door. Daniel Blackwood sat in her chair, his sharp gaze scanning the sketches scattered across her desk.

He checked his watch and scoffed. "Cutting it close, aren't you? That artist must really have you wrapped around his finger."

Evelyn forced a polite smile. She strode forward and snatched the draft from his hands. "First, I wasn't late. Second, I didn't break any rules. And third, who I have breakfast with is none of your business, Mr. Blackwood."

Daniel's expression darkened. "I warned you last night. That man is dangerous. Stay away from him."

He couldn't believe her audacity. One dinner with Theodore Allen, and she was already planning to move in with him?

"You met him yesterday," Daniel hissed. "Less than twenty-four hours, and you're already making life-altering decisions? I never took you for the reckless type, Evelyn."

She laughed, amused by his irritation. "Oh, I've always been reckless, Mr. Blackwood. You just never paid attention." She began organizing her desk. "Now, unless this is work-related, I suggest you leave. The office isn't the place for personal discussions."

Daniel narrowed his eyes. "It is work-related." He tossed a folder onto the desk. "There's a jewelry exhibition in Mariner's Cove next month. I need initial sketches by next week and finalized designs in two."

Evelyn flipped through the documents, then stared at him in disbelief. "You expect me to draft an entire collection in one week?"

She let out a sharp laugh. "Inspiration doesn't work on command, Daniel. Quality takes time. This is impossible."

He leaned back, unimpressed. "So you're saying you can't do it?"

His fingers drummed against the desk. "Maybe you're too distracted by your little artist friend."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. "This is ridiculous."

Daniel smirked. "Here's a deal—finish this in a week, and I'll give you a day off. You can take Liam and Emily out. Just the three of you."

Her breath caught.

Daniel had kept the twins away from her since their separation. The thought of seeing them again—even for a single day—made her chest ache.

She exhaled sharply and shut the folder. "Fine. I'll do it."

"Good. I'll be waiting." With that, he strode out.

But just before the door closed, Daniel glanced back. Evelyn was already scribbling notes, her focus absolute. The desperation in her movements was unmistakable.

He sighed and walked away.

"Why is she so attached to them? They aren't even hers."

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn’t Easy
###Chapter 264

Daniel frowned.

"Either she's got hidden intentions or she's an actual saint," Harrison mused, lounging on the couch in Daniel's office. "And knowing her? Definitely not the latter."

Daniel leaned back in his chair, gaze distant. "Hidden motives, then."

But what could she possibly want?

Harrison stretched, shooting Daniel a teasing look. "I mean, I'm not exactly hard on the eyes either. Why do all the women chase after you?"

Daniel took a slow sip of coffee. "What's your point?"

"The Prescott heiress, Vivian, has gone missing." Harrison yawned, then smirked. "Mr. Prescott asked me to check if you've seen her."

"No." Daniel's brows furrowed. "Haven't seen her in years." The last time had been at his wedding to Evelyn.

"Same here. Must be six or seven years now. Rumor has it she's obsessed with cosmetic surgeries—either recovering from one or booking the next."

Harrison tilted his head. "Your families had that arranged marriage set up before either of you were born. She always wanted to marry you, and apparently, she's still single. Now that she's vanished, I figured she might be with you."

Daniel smirked. "If she shows up, you'll be the first to know." Then he paused. "Come over for dinner tonight. You missed the wedding—might as well meet Diana and the kids."

Harrison waved a hand. "Can't tonight. Rain check."

Night settled over the city, the sky deepening into darkness. But the Blackwood Group Tower remained alive with activity.

When Diana called for the third time, Daniel finally set down his documents with a sigh.

He took the elevator down. At the lobby, he caught snippets of conversation from two designers.

"She's been gone for days, and now she's back like a woman possessed."

"Thank God I made up an excuse to leave. Otherwise, we'd be stuck here all night..."

Their voices faded. Daniel's frown deepened. He turned, pressing the button for the 18th floor.

The floor was deserted, save for the faint scratch of a pencil and rustling paper from one corner.

Daniel followed the sound to Evelyn's office—the only lit space in the darkness. Through the glass, he saw her bent over an easel, completely absorbed in her sketch.

The desk lamp cast soft shadows across her profile. The intensity in her eyes, the way she absently chewed the end of her pencil—it was achingly familiar.

She looked just like the woman he'd fallen in love with years ago.

His chest tightened.

Before he could step forward, a figure appeared down the hall.

Theodore, dressed in white, approached with a takeout bag. He knocked lightly on Evelyn's door. "Director Carter, dinner's here."

Evelyn looked up, surprised. "Theo? What are you doing here?"

"Didn't want you skipping meals." He set the food on her desk, grinning. "Two options: eat now and work later, or eat now and let me take you home after."

Evelyn sighed, packing up her things. "Fine. Option two."

Outside the door, Daniel's hands clenched into fists.
###Chapter 265

"How did you know I'd be working late?" Evelyn asked between bites of the takeout Theodore had brought.

Theodore smirked. "What if I said I've been parked outside since five?"

Evelyn nearly choked. "Seriously?"

"Obviously not." He stretched lazily in his chair. "I got Grace's number this morning. Called her just now—she said you weren't home yet. Figured you were still buried in work."

Relief washed over Evelyn. The thought of him waiting for hours would've been too much.

She scarfed down the last bite. "Let's go."

Theodore laughed, gathering the empty containers. "Landlord's waiting."

Evelyn followed him out, unaware of Daniel lurking in the shadows. His jaw tightened as he watched them head for the elevator.

Just as the doors closed, Theodore suddenly turned—his gaze slicing straight toward Daniel's hiding spot.

The elevator descended. A second later, Daniel's phone buzzed. Diana again, demanding he come home.

He silenced it with a growl and stepped into the next elevator. Outside, Theodore's taillights vanished in the opposite direction of Grace's place.

Was Evelyn really going home with him? The woman had no decency left.

Daniel's fists clenched. His phone rang again—Emily this time.

"Daddy, when are you coming?" Her voice wobbled. "The mean lady won't let us eat until you're here. Liam and I are starving!"

Daniel froze. "Diana's withholding dinner?"

"Yeah! She says we're 'ill-mannered brats.'" Emily sniffled. "No snacks either. Last thing I ate was my teacher's apple at preschool. It's been forever!"

"I'm on my way." He hung up, casting one last glare at the empty road where Theodore's car had been. Then he spun toward his own vehicle.

Evelyn was just an employee. Who she spent her nights with meant nothing to him.

Thirty minutes later, Daniel pulled into Silvercrest Manor's driveway.

"Daniel! You're finally home!" Diana rushed out, all smiles. "The children and I waited—"

He cut her off with a glance, spotting two small faces pressed against an upstairs window.

After a beat, he slung an arm around Diana's shoulders and steered her inside. "My schedule's unpredictable. Don't make the kids wait to eat."

Diana pouted, clinging to his hand. "But manners matter! I won't raise disrespectful children. Evelyn spoiled them, but what can you expect? She's hardly high-class."

Daniel's frown deepened. He'd been raised in aristocracy—this wasn't discipline. It was cruelty.

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn't Easy
###Chapter 266

Daniel still remembered what Evelyn had once told him.

"If we ever have children, I'll teach them to stay authentic. They can be polite in public, but at home, they should feel free to be themselves."

Clearly, Diana had forgotten that promise. Six years had changed her beyond recognition—so much that Daniel barely knew her anymore.

He exhaled sharply and guided Diana inside.

"Daddy!"

"Welcome home, Daddy! We know you worked hard today!"

The moment they stepped in, Liam and Emily greeted them. The twins stood on either side of the doorway, bowing with practiced smiles.

Daniel's expression darkened instantly. He studied his children—Emily's cheeks were flushed, her eyes damp, while Liam's jaw was clenched in clear frustration. It was obvious they'd been coerced into this.

Releasing Diana's arm, he shot her a frosty glare. "Is this what you call teaching them manners?"

Diana stiffened. His displeasure was unmistakable.

Her eyes narrowed in irritation. She had told them to compliment their father, but she never instructed them to bow like servants!

Their miserable expressions told Daniel everything—Diana had forced them into this charade.

She forced a nervous laugh. "No, of course not! They must’ve picked this up from a show. They probably thought you'd like it."

Glancing at the twins, she added, "Your father’s had a long day. You don’t need to do this. He doesn’t enjoy formalities at home."

Relief flickered through Daniel—until Liam cut in, scowling.

"But you told us to do this. You said being respectful would make Mr. Blackwood happy. Why is he mad now?"

Diana’s eyes flashed. "What nonsense are you spouting? I never said that!"

"This afternoon," Emily piped up innocently. "You said kids have to learn to please adults so they’ll like us."

Diana’s brows furrowed. "I never—"

"Ha! Called it!" Emily smirked at her brother. "Liam, play the recording."

Liam nodded, pulling a voice recorder from his pocket. Diana’s own voice filled the room:

"When your father gets home, compliment him and show respect. It’ll make him happy. Children need to learn how to please adults."

Word for word, just as Emily had said.

Diana paled. She thought she’d gotten away with it—but the twins had been recording her all along.

Daniel’s jaw tightened. He turned to Diana, voice icy. "You’re teaching them to manipulate people? Is this your idea of parenting?"

She bit her lip, trapped. With the evidence laid bare, denial was impossible.

After a long silence, she burst into tears.

"Daniel, I’m sorry…" She wiped her cheeks dramatically. "Ever since I came back, you’ve been working late every night. Sometimes you don’t even come home. I thought…" Her voice cracked. "I thought you didn’t want us anymore."
###Chapter 267

The moment Evelyn's tears fell, Daniel's heart clenched. He exhaled sharply and drew her into an embrace. "Don't think like that. Work's just been... overwhelming lately."

His thumb brushed away the dampness beneath her lashes. "I'm here now."

Evelyn kept her face lowered, but victory gleamed in her eyes. She sniffled softly. "I understand. Your work comes first. I just needed to know you don't resent me or the children."

Daniel's palm rubbed comforting circles on her back. "Resent you? Never."

Releasing her, he scooped up Sophia effortlessly. "Let's eat."

"Of course." Evelyn watched them disappear toward the dining room before whirling on Liam. Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "You recorded me? Clever boy."

Liam flashed a grin that didn't reach his eyes. "Learned from the master. Though you still outplayed us. Impressive." With a careless shrug, he sauntered after his father.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. These brats needed discipline, but Daniel's watchful gaze tied her hands. How dare they trap her!

"Liam, Sophia," Daniel's voice carried from the dining room. "From now on, eat when you're hungry. Don't wait for me." A weighted pause. "Children shouldn't have to earn adults' approval."

Sophia nodded vigorously, shoveling food into her mouth with uncharacteristic haste.

Daniel's brow furrowed at her desperate chewing. "If it's not mealtime, ask for snacks. Fruits. Dessert. Growing bodies need fuel."

"Ms. Diana says snacks spoil appetites," Liam countered, lips pursed. "Who should we believe? You or her? Maybe duel it out and tell us who wins."

Evelyn's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "Your father's word is law here."

Liam tilted his head. "So we ignore you unless he agrees?"

Her smile froze.

"Enough." Daniel's sharp glance silenced them both. "You'll respect Ms. Diana."

Liam's shrug was pure insolence. "Why? She's not our mother."

Evelyn's face drained of color.

"Liam." Daniel's voice turned to steel. "My study. After dinner."

The boy grinned, all childish innocence. "Scolding time?"

A warning glare was his only answer. Daniel focused on serving Sophia seconds, the silence thick enough to choke on.

Later, Liam sprawled across the study's leather sofa without invitation. "What's the verdict, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel's jaw tightened at the disrespect. "Sit properly."
###Chapter 268

Liam flopped onto the couch with an exaggerated sigh. Daniel's stern gaze made him straighten up immediately. "Fine, I'll sit properly. What's so important?"

"Your mother is Diana." Daniel's voice carried an uncharacteristic weight. "She carried you and Emily for nine months, survived a car accident while pregnant. Life hasn't been kind to her. I understand you've grown close to Evelyn, but that doesn't give you license to disrespect your birth mother."

Liam barely suppressed an eye roll. The audacity! Evelyn was their real mother - this imposter Diana just wanted Daniel's money.

"Answer me." Daniel's tone turned glacial when Liam remained silent.

Liam bit his lip. "It's not that simple, Mr. Blackwood. Respect goes both ways. Diana bans snacks between meals, makes us wait hours for dinner, and teaches us to cater to adult whims. Would you want that kind of mother?"

A shadow crossed Daniel's face. He'd been just as rebellious at their age, chafing under arbitrary rules. These twins mirrored his younger self too much...

"You're right about that," Daniel conceded. "I'll speak with Diana about-"

"Great! When she learns to be half the mother Evelyn is, we'll reconsider." Liam's smirk held absolute certainty. Diana would never measure up.

Like Vanessa before her, Diana saw them as obstacles to Daniel's fortune. Vanessa had tried eliminating Emily upon arrival at Silvercrest Manor, gambling on Daniel's forgiveness after years together. She'd lost that bet.

Diana played smarter - no overt attacks, even cutting a deal to free Evelyn to avoid exposure. But Liam knew the moment she secured Daniel's commitment, they'd become disposable.

Daniel's sudden laugh held no warmth. "Evelyn must be quite the paragon, inspiring such devotion."

"The absolute best!" Liam's chest swelled with pride.

"The best," Daniel echoed darkly. An image flashed - Evelyn leaving with Theodore Allen, heading toward his apartment. "The kind of 'best' who goes home with near-strangers, apparently."

Liam's small hands balled into fists. "That's a lie!"

"I saw it." Daniel's phone displayed the damning security footage - Evelyn entering Theodore's car, the vehicle turning toward the artist's neighborhood. "Call her. Ask where she is right now."

The challenge hung between them like a guillotine blade.
###Chapter 269

Daniel arched an eyebrow at Liam. "I distinctly recall instructing you not to contact her."

A cold smirk played on Daniel's lips. "Since when do my orders mean anything to you? Did you really think I wouldn't notice the new signal blocker you installed?"

Liam's shoulders slumped instantly. When Evelyn had been released, Daniel had issued strict orders against any communication, even threatening to monitor their phone activity.

The boy had resorted to Oliver's help to install the jamming device, believing it would mask their calls.

He never expected Daniel would discover it.

"Fine." Liam shuffled his feet. "Should I call her now?" His voice was barely above a whisper as he turned toward the door.

"Stay." Daniel's command froze him mid-step. "You'll call her right here."

With a grimace, Liam slumped onto the couch and dialed. Across from him, Daniel leaned back in his chair.

"Speakerphone." The demand came sharp and clear.

Liam balked. "That's not—"

"Problem?" Daniel's eyes narrowed. "Unless you're afraid your saintly mother might say something... incriminating?"

Rolling his eyes, Liam complied. The line connected instantly.

"Liam?" Evelyn's cheerful voice filled the room. "Calling so late? Is Daniel asleep already?"

Liam shot a glance at the glowering man opposite him. "Yeah, out cold."

"Thank goodness." Evelyn's laugh tinkled through the speakers. "I know he dotes on Emily, but boys? I swear that man would skin you alive if he caught you!"

Normally, Liam would fire back with boasts about never getting caught. Tonight, he just coughed awkwardly. "So... where are you?"

Crunching sounds came through the line. "At Grace's place. We're demolishing a fruit platter."

"Hi, sweetheart!" Grace's voice chirped in the background.

Liam exhaled sharply and shot Daniel a triumphant look. The corner of Daniel's mouth twitched—whether in amusement or relief, it was hard to tell.

"Mom," Liam pressed, "met anyone interesting lately?"

"Actually, yes!" The sound of rustling sheets followed as Evelyn presumably settled in. "Remember Theo Allen? The artist I adore? He's renting this gorgeous place in Willowbrook and offered to show me around. I'm thinking of taking it! I'll text you the address once—"

Liam didn't wait for her to finish. After a few more pleasantries, he hung up and leveled Daniel with a smirk.

"Happy now, Mr. Blackwood? She was house-hunting. Not whatever filthy scenario you imagined." With that, he strutted out, leaving Daniel fighting a losing battle against a smile.

The door creaked open again moments later. Diana glided in, coffee cup in hand, her lips curved in a knowing smile.
###Chapter 270

Evelyn set the teacup down and draped her arms around Daniel's shoulders. She exhaled softly near his ear, her breath warm. "I thought you said you were free tonight?"

Daniel's jaw tightened. This should have been a normal moment between lovers, but something about her touch made his skin crawl. Maybe the years apart had changed things. Or maybe he had.

After a pause, he peeled her arms away. Evelyn blinked, stunned. Daniel didn't acknowledge her reaction, just lifted the cup and took a slow sip.

The tea steadied him. "You should get some rest, Evelyn. I have work to finish."

Her lips pursed. "Work? Again?" Her voice sharpened. "Daniel, am I less important than your emails? You haven't spent a single proper evening with me since I came back. We used to be inseparable. What happened?"

His gaze darkened. "Did we?"

Evelyn stiffened. She looked away, teeth sinking into her lower lip. "I meant... it felt that way to me."

Daniel studied her. "I wasn't a good husband."

To the world, they'd been the perfect couple. Evelyn had fought for him, defied their families, even ruined his arranged engagement to Vivian Prescott. But Daniel knew the truth—he'd been absent, buried in work, convinced he'd never love her.

It wasn't until she vanished that he realized his mistake. Six years of regret, six years of guilt. And now, faced with her again, he discovered she remembered none of it. To her, their marriage had been bliss.

Was she lying? Or had he tortured himself for nothing?

A muscle jumped in his jaw. The weight of his remorse crashed over him. Before he could think, he scooped her into his arms.

Evelyn gasped, then melted against him, fingers threading through his hair. "Daniel..."

He carried her to the bedroom, lowering her onto the silk sheets.

Her chest rose rapidly, eyes locked on the ceiling. Tonight. Finally.

The amber glow of the lamps painted the room in warm hues. Daniel cupped her chin, forcing himself to kiss her.

Nothing. No spark. No desire.

Just as his hands moved to her waist, he stopped.

Evelyn's eyes fluttered open, hazy with want. "What is it?"

"You should shower first."

She hesitated, then nodded, slipping off the bed.

Daniel watched steam fog the glass door, her silhouette blurring behind it. He shut his eyes.

He couldn't do this.

With Evelyn, it had been effortless. Why not now?

A ragged sigh escaped him. Evelyn had suffered enough. She deserved better. He owed her this.

His fingers twisted in the sheets.
###Chapter 271

Daniel turned and spotted the crimson stain on the sheets where Evelyn had been lying moments before.

Relief washed over him. He scribbled a note and placed it on the bed before quietly exiting the room.

In the bathroom, Evelyn groaned in frustration. Her period had arrived at the worst possible time.

She had planned everything perfectly—tonight was supposed to be the night she finally seduced Daniel and secured her place as his wife. But now? Ruined.

After cleaning up, she dug through the medicine cabinet until she found her birth control pills. She swallowed one without hesitation. Desperate times called for desperate measures.

When she stepped out of the bathroom, Daniel was gone. Instead, she found a steaming bowl of soup and a pack of tampons on the nightstand.

A maid was already stripping the stained sheets. Spotting Evelyn, she handed her a folded note. "Mr. Blackwood left this for you."

Evelyn snatched it and read:

[I'll be in the guest room tonight. Rest well. There's no rush—we have our whole lives ahead of us.]

Her fingers clenched around the paper. Our whole lives. That was his favorite excuse to push her away.

She had been back at Silvercrest Manor for weeks, yet he still kept his distance. Not even a kiss.

First, she had to deal with Diana and the twins. Now, when she finally had a chance to make her move, her own body betrayed her.

Once the maid left, Evelyn slammed the bedroom door shut. She flopped onto the bed and dialed a number. "Mr. Prescott, I need your help."

Over breakfast, Diana announced her decision. "I found a new place. I'm moving out tonight."

Grace's fork clattered onto her plate. "What? So soon?"

Diana shrugged. "The rent isn't cheap. No point wasting time when I've already paid for this month."

Grace pouted. "I didn’t expect you to find something this fast..."

"Theodore helped." Diana sipped her coffee. "He has connections."

Grace narrowed her eyes. "Isn’t it weird how much he’s doing for you? You barely know each other."

Diana chuckled. "He’s harmless."

"I didn’t say he wasn’t." Grace hesitated. "By the way, do you know Vivian Prescott? The eldest daughter of the Prescott family from Mariner’s Cove?"

Diana stiffened. "Yes."

Vivian Prescott was the woman Daniel was supposed to marry years ago. Everyone thought it was just an arrangement between their parents—until Vivian became obsessed with the idea.

Back then, Daniel had no intention of marrying her. Diana, hopelessly in love, had jokingly suggested he marry her instead.

To her shock, he agreed. The next day, they were at the courthouse signing marriage papers.

She thought it was the start of something beautiful.

She was wrong.

Daniel’s words from that day still haunted her:

"I can’t promise I’ll ever love you. But I can promise I’ll never betray you. You’ll always be safe with me."

Lies. Every single word.
###Chapter 272

"Not really." Grace pressed her lips together. "You know Grandview Medical Center has the top plastic surgery department in Willowbrook. Lately, people have been asking if anyone's seen Vivian. They suspect she might have visited our hospital."

She leaned in slightly. "Rumor has it Vivian became obsessed with cosmetic procedures after her fiancé called off their engagement. It was an arranged marriage, but he refused to go through with it."

Evelyn calmly took a bite of her salad. "That fiancé was Daniel Blackwood."

Grace's eyes widened. "Wait—so the woman who stole him was—"

"Me." Evelyn flashed a wry smile. "Shocking, right?"

Grace stared, speechless for a moment. "Very."

Evelyn set down her fork and stood, slipping into her coat. "Like me, Ms. Prescott is just another fool who fell for the wrong man. We both wasted too much on Daniel. I almost feel sorry for her."

The statement left Grace frowning in confusion. After a pause, she ventured, "Evelyn...do you think Vivian might have used your face as a reference for her surgeries?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Anyone who knows Daniel and me understands we were never happy. No one would believe he loved me. And if he didn’t, why would she want to look like me?" With that, she grabbed her bag and walked out.

Grace chewed her lip, turning the words over. It made sense, yet something felt off.

Everyone in Willowbrook knew Daniel still carried a torch for his ex-wife after all these years.

Evelyn arrived at the office just after seven. The floor was empty. She flicked on the lights, collected yesterday’s sketches, and shut her door to work.

An hour later, the office buzzed with chatter.

"Did you see the news? I never pegged Evelyn for that kind of person..."

"That painting was a masterpiece! Destroying it out of jealousy? Typical."

"Word is Mr. Blackwood only dated Evelyn to lure his ex-wife back. Now that she’s returned, he dumped her. No wonder she snapped."

"Still, ruining art? That’s low."

Even through the door, Evelyn caught the whispers. Her jaw tightened as she yanked it open.

The chatter died instantly.

Cassandra, oblivious, continued with a smirk, "And after the scandal, Mr. Blackwood gave her an impossible project yesterday. Clearly, he’s making her pay for costing him ten million."

"You know Daniel better than he knows himself," Evelyn remarked dryly.

Cassandra whirled around, paling. "Director Carter! We didn’t realize you were here."

Evelyn arched a brow. "If you had, would the gossip have stopped?" Her gaze sharpened. "What painting?"

Biting her lip, Cassandra handed over her phone. The headline blared: [When Envy Turns Destructive: Woman Vandalizes Priceless Artwork]

A video showed Diana in tears, accusing Evelyn of ruining Theodore’s painting. Then, surveillance footage cut to Daniel’s dismissive shrug. "I didn’t see anything."

Evelyn’s lips curled. She knew exactly who had leaked this.

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn’t Easy
###Chapter 273

Evelyn shrugged and handed the phone back to Cassandra. "Get back to work. Browsing gossip during office hours isn't professional."

Cassandra gaped. "Director Evelyn, don't you... have anything to say about this?"

Evelyn shot her a glance. "Why should I explain myself to you? Let me put it this way—none of you would believe me even if I did, so why waste my breath?" With that, she turned and strode back into her office, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

Truthfully, Evelyn couldn’t care less about Diana running to the press. It didn’t matter if the entire world read that article and painted her as the jealous, scheming villain. The Evelyn who once craved validation and bent over backward to please others was long gone.

All she cared about now was finishing her designs on time so she could take Liam and Emily on that promised outing with Daniel.

The day flew by in a blur of work. As the clock struck five, a knock sounded at her door. "Director Evelyn, you have a visitor."

Evelyn checked the time—right on schedule. She smiled, assuming it was Theodore coming to pick her up. "Let them in."

But when the door swung open, it wasn’t Theodore standing there.

It was Eleanor Blackwood.

The elderly woman stormed in, flanked by two maids, and dropped onto the couch with a huff. Her expression was thunderous, her grip on her cane white-knuckled. "Well, well. If I hadn’t seen the news today, I wouldn’t have known you were working here!"

Evelyn’s lips curled slightly. "Madam, you fired me from Silvercrest Manor because Serena paid you off. Now you’re here to get me dismissed from Blackwood Group? Who bribed you this time—Diana?"

Eleanor’s face darkened at the mention of Diana. "How dare you speak her name! Do you think I don’t know what you’ve done?"

She thumped her cane against the floor. "You destroyed a painting by Diana’s favorite artist—out of pure spite! She came to me in tears over this! That artwork meant everything to her. She’s adored that artist since she was a girl, and you ruined it like it was nothing!"

The more she ranted, the angrier Eleanor grew. She looked ready to swing her cane at Evelyn’s head. "First, you sabotaged Daniel and Serena. Now that Diana—his real wife, Emily’s birth mother—is back, you’re trying to tear this family apart again!"

She jabbed a finger toward the door. "Get out! Blackwood Group has no place for someone like you! Either you leave now, or I’ll drag Daniel here and have you fired on the spot!"

Evelyn almost laughed. She leaned back in her chair, meeting Eleanor’s glare without flinching. "Go ahead. Call him. Let’s see if he’ll fire his most dedicated employee."

Her defiance only fueled Eleanor’s rage. No one had ever dared to disrespect her like this.

Eleanor lurched to her feet and snatched one of Evelyn’s freshly completed sketches off the desk. Before Evelyn could react, she ripped it clean in half.

Evelyn’s blood ran cold as the torn pieces fluttered to the floor. But Eleanor wasn’t done. She reached for another design.

"Stop!" Evelyn’s voice cracked like a whip. She couldn’t stand by while hours of work were destroyed in seconds. She seized Eleanor’s wrist and yanked the torn paper away.

"How dare you!" Eleanor shrieked, eyes wild. "You ruined Diana’s treasure—why shouldn’t I ruin yours?" She lunged for another sketch.

Evelyn caught both her wrists, her patience snapping. She hated anyone touching her work, but destroying it? Unforgivable.

She didn’t know what lies Diana had fed Eleanor, but she wouldn’t let this woman obliterate her efforts. No one, no matter how composed, would tolerate this.
###Chapter 274

Audrey guided Evelyn and Theodore into Daniel's office. The moment they stepped inside, Eleanor Blackwood was making a dramatic display on the sofa.

"Daniel, I'm just a fragile old woman! My bones aren't what they used to be, and that Evelyn girl nearly crushed my wrist! I thought she was going to snap it clean off!"

"That painting was worth ten million dollars! Do you realize how much that is? You could buy an entire Celestial Dreams collection with that kind of money!"

Even from the hallway, Evelyn and Theodore could hear Eleanor's shrill complaints.

Theodore's expression darkened momentarily before he glanced at Evelyn, amusement flickering in his eyes. "Seems even Eleanor is a fan of your work."

Evelyn scoffed but didn’t respond.

Audrey knocked lightly before entering. "Mr. Blackwood, Director Carter is here."

Daniel sat behind his desk, massaging his temples in clear frustration. "Let her in."

The door swung open, revealing two figures. Daniel's gaze immediately locked onto Theodore. The two men stared at each other—one with barely concealed hostility, the other calm, composed, with just a hint of arrogance. The tension lasted only a second before they broke eye contact.

"You little witch!" Eleanor snapped at Evelyn, but before she could continue, her attention shifted to the man beside her. She scowled. "And who the hell are you?"

"I'm her friend." Theodore offered a polite smile before taking a seat beside Eleanor. "I understand there’s been some misunderstanding between you and Evelyn."

His composed demeanor seemed to momentarily disarm Eleanor's fury. "Are you here to settle this?"

"You could say that."

Eleanor huffed. "Fine. Your friend here destroyed my granddaughter-in-law’s favorite painting out of jealousy! She even forced my grandson to pay ten million in compensation!"

She thrust her phone at Theodore, displaying the same viral article Evelyn had seen earlier. "Look at this! It’s everywhere!"

Theodore kept his smile intact. "Alright, Mrs. Blackwood. What would you like Evelyn to do?"

"I want her to repay my grandson, resign immediately, and apologize to my granddaughter-in-law!" Eleanor barked out her demands before shooting Daniel a cold glare. "I don’t know what spell this woman has cast on him, but he refuses to agree to any of this!"

Daniel's frown deepened. "I told you, this isn’t what you think."

"What do you mean it isn’t? The proof is right here! You were there—you saw everything!" Eleanor waved her phone furiously. "And yet you’re defending her? Ten million dollars, Daniel! You threw it away for her!"

Her voice rose to a shriek. "If I’d known this would happen, I wouldn’t have just fired her from Silvercrest Manor—I should’ve banished her from Willowbrook entirely! This family is falling apart because of her!"

Daniel’s patience finally snapped. "You’re the one tearing this family apart!"

If not for Eleanor’s interference years ago, none of this would have happened. If she hadn’t pressured Evelyn about children, she wouldn’t have spiraled into despair.

Eleanor recoiled, stunned by his outburst. After a beat, she whirled on Evelyn, eyes blazing. "This is all your fault! Daniel has never spoken to me like this before!"

Evelyn couldn’t help but smirk.

Pursuing My Ex-Wife Isn’t Easy

###Chapter 275

Evelyn knew Eleanor Blackwood was lying to herself.

"You claim Daniel never defied you? Years ago, you wanted him to marry Vivian Prescott, yet he chose me instead. After my death, you pushed him to take Vivian as his second wife, but he got engaged to Serena Hart. You gave them your blessing, only for them to break up." Evelyn met Eleanor's gaze coldly. "Daniel has spent his entire life resisting you. Since when has he ever obeyed you?"

She expected her words to silence Eleanor, to finally retaliate for the ruined sketch. Instead, the old woman laughed.

"None of that is true. It wasn’t my wish for Daniel to marry Vivian—it was his father’s. You have no idea how much my grandson respects me." Eleanor’s smirk deepened. "Years ago, when he was married to you, I told him I wanted great-grandchildren, but you refused. Daniel promised he’d fulfill my wish."

Her voice dripped with satisfaction. "You couldn’t conceive, so I made you try traditional remedies. Witch doctors cast spells, forced you to swallow dirt and ashes. You thought Daniel didn’t know, but he allowed it all."

Eleanor sighed mockingly. "I never expected those barbaric methods to work, but they did. You finally got pregnant. Though I shouldn’t call you you anymore. You’re Diana now. A much better name—one that doesn’t belong to a worthless woman like you."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. The memories surged—the humiliation, the pain, the nights curled up in agony, too afraid to tell Daniel. She had suffered in silence, believing he was unaware.

Now, Eleanor wielded her suffering as proof of Daniel’s obedience.

A knife twisted in Evelyn’s heart. She stumbled back, her spine hitting the door. The pain was nothing compared to the betrayal slicing through her.

"Grandmother." Daniel’s voice cut in, sharp with warning. "That’s enough."

He had learned the truth too late—after Evelyn was gone. The guilt still haunted him. He had vowed to protect her and failed.

Theodore Allen, sensing the tension, smoothly intervened. "You mentioned repayment, didn’t you? Ten million upfront to stay at Blackwood Group?"

Eleanor scoffed. "As if she could afford it."

Theodore pulled a check from his pocket. "Will this do?"
###Chapter 276

Eleanor Blackwood took the check from Theodore and studied it. Her face twisted in confusion. Why was Daniel's signature at the bottom?

Theodore smirked. "The reason I'm here today—aside from picking up Evelyn—is to return this check to Daniel."

Eleanor's frown deepened as she processed his words. Then, realization struck. Her eyes widened, and she snapped her gaze back to Theodore. "Is this the check Daniel paid Mr. Allen with? Are you—?"

"I'm Theodore Allen." His grin widened. "And just so you know, the real painting worth ten million dollars is still safe in my study. I'd never leave something that valuable out in the open. The one that got ruined was a replica."

He watched Eleanor's stunned expression with amusement before continuing, "When Mr. Blackwood thought the painting was destroyed, he immediately wrote me a check as compensation. But I couldn't accept it, so I'm giving it back."

Eleanor was speechless.

"Now that the money's returned," Theodore said smoothly, "Evelyn shouldn't have to resign anymore. Any objections?"

Eleanor glanced down at the check, her lips pressed into a thin line.

"Fine," she muttered reluctantly. "She doesn't have to resign. But she still owes Diana an apology!"

She jabbed a finger toward Evelyn. "Even if the painting was fake, she destroyed it just to spite Diana! And she hurt me earlier—she needs to apologize for that too!"

"Apologize?" Evelyn crossed her arms. "The painting belonged to Theodore. If anyone deserves an apology, it's him—not Diana."

She turned her sharp gaze on Eleanor. "And I didn't hurt you. Even if I had, you tore up my design sketch first. If anything, you should be apologizing to me."

Daniel stiffened. "You tore her sketch?"

Theodore nodded. "Ripped it right in half. Evelyn spent all afternoon on it."

Daniel's jaw tightened. He looked at Evelyn. "Is that true?"

She rolled her eyes. "Yes, your grandmother destroyed my work. And no, I didn't hurt her. But even if I had, she started it. I'm not apologizing."

Eleanor's face paled.

Daniel pinched the bridge of his nose, exhaling sharply before fixing Eleanor with a hard stare. "Apologize to her."

Eleanor blinked, then scoffed. "You heard him! He wants you to apologize!" she snapped at Evelyn. "It's just a stupid drawing, but you laid hands on the CEO's grandmother! You should be groveling!"

Daniel's patience snapped. "Grandmother," he growled, "you're the one apologizing."

Eleanor recoiled.

"How many times have I told you to stay out of my business?" His voice was ice. "Evelyn works for me. Tearing up her sketch is no different from shredding a million-dollar contract in my office."

Eleanor's lips trembled, but she jutted her chin stubbornly. "That's ridiculous! Your contracts are worth fortunes. Her scribbles mean nothing. She's not Moon."

Theodore burst out laughing. "Who says she isn't?"

Eleanor froze.

With a smirk, Theodore leaned in. "Guess you didn't know? Evelyn Carter is Moon. It's an honor for Blackwood Group to have her here—yet all she gets is disrespect."

Eleanor's face drained of color. She stared at Evelyn in shock, then turned to Daniel. "That's... impossible!"

For years, Eleanor had coveted Moon's designs, scouring auctions to add them to her collection. The idea that the woman she'd been berating was the legendary designer herself—it was unthinkable.
###Chapter 277

The retired status of the legendary jewelry designer Mo had sent her pieces' prices skyrocketing. Evelyn Carter knew acquiring even a single item now would require a small fortune.

Daniel Blackwood's claim that the woman before them was Mo herself made Eleanor Blackwood's face drain of color. "Preposterous!" she scoffed, clutching her pearl necklace.

Theodore Allen's smirk deepened. "Why else would an artist of my caliber associate with her? Use your brain, Eleanor."

Eleanor's trembling fingers brushed against the torn sketch in her pocket. "Then...the drawing I destroyed—"

"Was valued at seven figures. Minimum."

The revelation hit Eleanor like a physical blow. Her gaze darted to Daniel, whose silence confirmed Theodore's words. With shaky hands, she reached for her phone, but Daniel was faster.

"Audrey," he barked into his phone, "escort my grandmother home immediately."

The door swung open before he finished speaking. Audrey Sinclair materialized, offering Eleanor a supporting arm. "Let's get you home, Mrs. Blackwood."

Eleanor seized the escape route. "Yes, yes. I've overstayed my welcome." The check Theodore had forced into her hand burned in her pocket as she scurried out.

Daniel's voice turned glacial as the door clicked shut. "Don't interfere again."

"That Diana Hart put me up to this!" Eleanor's muffled protest faded down the hallway.

The moment they were alone, Daniel exhaled sharply. "My apologies, Evelyn. I'll extend your deadline by forty-eight hours to compensate for today's... disruptions."

Evelyn's phone screen illuminated her sharp smile. "There's another matter." She displayed the viral article Cassandra had shown her earlier—now boasting twelve million views.

"My media contacts confirm this traction isn't organic. Someone's paying for promotion." She pocketed the phone with deliberate slowness. "Investigate this, Daniel. Not for my sake, but to spare your wife the humiliation when I release the security footage from that night."

She strode toward the exit, tossing her final ultimatum over her shoulder. "You have two hours. After that, I go public. And trust me—Diana will be the one they laugh at."

Theodore bounded after her like an overeager puppy. "Dinner first, or shall we start packing your studio?"

"Food. I'm starving."

Daniel stared at the empty doorway long after their voices faded. The computer screen reflected in his darkening eyes—he'd been too buried in merger documents to notice the scandal brewing.

Eleanor's parting words echoed: "Diana orchestrated this."

His phone vibrated with Diana's caller ID. "Daniel? It's past seven. When are you coming home?"

The screen went black as he powered down his workstation. "On my way." The icy promise in his tone would've made a lesser woman shudder.
###Chapter 278

The moment Evelyn Carter officially retired, her jewelry pieces skyrocketed in value. They became so outrageously expensive that acquiring even a single piece was nearly impossible.

Theodore Allen claimed the woman standing before them was Evelyn herself. Naturally, Eleanor Blackwood refused to believe it.

"Why wouldn't it be possible?" Theodore smirked, tilting his head. "Do you think someone like me would befriend just anyone? Only someone of Evelyn's caliber deserves my friendship."

Eleanor's face paled further. Her trembling fingers clutched the edge of the desk as she whispered, "Then... the sketch I tore..."

"That piece alone was worth millions."

All color drained from Eleanor's face. When Daniel Blackwood didn't deny it, she knew Theodore wasn't lying.

Daniel's gaze flickered to his grandmother's horrified expression before he picked up his phone. He dialed a number and spoke coolly, "Come to my office. Escort my grandmother home."

The moment he hung up, Audrey Sinclair entered and gently helped Eleanor to her feet. "Let's get you home, Mrs. Blackwood."

Eleanor seized the opportunity to escape. "Yes, yes. I won't interfere anymore."

Diana Hart had been the one to drag Eleanor into this mess, promising her a set of Evelyn's jewelry in return. But things had spiraled out of control—not only had Eleanor failed to defend Diana, but she had also unknowingly insulted Evelyn herself.

Daniel's jaw tightened as he watched his grandmother leave. "Don't involve yourself in my affairs again."

"It wasn't my fault! Your wife sent me here!" Eleanor muttered, hastily stuffing the check Theodore had given her into her pocket before scurrying out.

Once the door shut, Daniel exhaled and turned to Evelyn. "I apologize for my grandmother's behavior. I'll extend your deadline by two days to compensate."

Evelyn's lips curved into a cold smile. "There's another issue." She pulled out her phone and showed him the viral article Cassandra Montgomery had sent her. In less than a day, it had amassed over ten million views.

"I consulted some media-savvy friends. They confirmed this kind of traction doesn't happen without paid promotion. I expect you to investigate—not just for my sake, but for your wife's."

She slid her phone back into her pocket. "Of course, if you refuse, I have my own methods. I possess surveillance footage from that night, ready to release at any moment."

Her voice turned icy. "You have two hours to handle this. If you don’t, I will. And when I do, your wife will be the one humiliated—not me. We wouldn’t want that, would we?"

Without waiting for a response, she turned and strode out.

Theodore jumped up, flashing Daniel a grin. "Better handle this quickly, Mr. Blackwood." Then he hurried after Evelyn.

"Dinner first, or should we move your things?"

"Dinner."

Daniel watched them disappear, their voices fading down the hallway. His fingers clenched around the edge of his desk before he finally turned back to his computer.

He'd been buried in work all day. If not for Eleanor's interference, he wouldn’t have even seen the article.

Leaning back in his chair, he stared at the headline. Eleanor's words echoed in his mind: "Your wife sent me here."

His phone rang. Diana.

"Daniel, aren’t you off work yet? When are you coming home?"

His expression darkened as he shut down his computer. "I'm on my way."
###Chapter 279

Ethan's voice crackled through the phone. "Sir, we've got a lead. Someone's actively pushing that news article."

Daniel's fingers tightened around the report. "Any idea who?"

"Hit a dead end. The accounts trace back to an offshore company owned by an Andrew Prescott, but there's zero record of him existing. Probably a fake name."

Daniel's jaw clenched. "Dig deeper."

The call ended, and his grip on the steering wheel turned white-knuckled. Just how much had Evelyn changed in six years? What else didn't he know?

Silvercrest Manor came into view.

"Daniel!" Diana stood at the entrance, coat in hand. The moment his car stopped, she rushed forward, draping it over his shoulders with a practiced smile. "It's getting cold out."

His gaze flickered to her. "Autumn's settling in."

"I'll pick up some winter clothes for you tomorrow." She looped her arm through his, steering him inside. "I had Isabelle prepare snacks for Liam and Emily. Called you before they could get hungry." Her voice softened. "I'm really trying here."

Daniel's expression darkened. "Seen the news today?"

Diana blinked. "Which one?"

"The one with you and Evelyn."

"Oh, that." She waved a hand. "No clue who leaked the security footage. When I visited Eleanor earlier, she was furious—wanted to storm Pierce Corporation and confront Evelyn. I talked her down." She sighed. "Elderly folks believe anything."

Her performance almost made him forget Evelyn's warning. "Let's eat."

They walked in together.

The house felt unnervingly quiet. No patter of small feet. Daniel's eyes darted to the staircase.

"You said you didn't want them greeting you." Diana tilted her head. "Not upset, are you?"

He stiffened, then shook his head.

As they reached the dining room, Diana called upstairs, "Liam! Emily! Dinner!"

Minutes passed. No response.

Isabelle was sent to fetch them.

Finally, two small faces peered over the railing. Liam crossed his arms. "Not hungry."

Emily mimicked him. "Me neither."

They vanished.

Daniel's frown deepened.

"This is why I limited snacks." Diana sighed. "Kids have no restraint. Fill up on junk, skip meals." She fluttered her lashes. "Should I cut them off again tomorrow?"

Silence.

After a long pause, he exhaled. "I'll handle it."

Her smile faltered. "Fine." She signaled for dinner to be served.
###Chapter 280

This marked Evelyn and Daniel's first private meal together. Evelyn couldn't contain her excitement, constantly urging Daniel to eat more throughout dinner. Daniel had intended to discuss the day's events with her, but her infectious enthusiasm made it impossible to broach the subject.

Daniel placed his silverware down with finality. "Evelyn, we need to talk."

Evelyn was handing dirty dishes to a maid when she flashed him a bright smile. "Can't this wait? What's so important it can't hold until after dinner?"

"That art gallery had surveillance cameras." Daniel's gaze turned piercing. "The painting Diana destroyed was a replica. But there was a hidden camera embedded in the frame."

Evelyn's hands froze mid-air. After a beat, she forced a laugh. "That's... impossible..."

Theodore had been present when Diana vandalized the painting. If he possessed footage of the incident, why hadn't he produced it as evidence?

"I've said what I needed to say." Daniel studied her intently. "We used to share everything. Your honesty made me trust you completely - it's why I supported you unconditionally."

His voice dropped. "Now? I don't even recognize you anymore."

With that, Daniel rose and turned toward the door.

Evelyn's jaw tightened. "Where do you think you're going?"

Daniel hesitated briefly before continuing his exit. "If you won't be honest with me, I owe you no explanations either."

Evelyn's expression darkened as she watched him leave. Storming upstairs, she yanked open her nightstand drawer and retrieved a burner phone. "Mr. Prescott, abort everything," she hissed into the receiver.

Daniel wouldn't lie about this. If Evelyn possessed actual footage of that night, every carefully laid plan would crumble. The risk was unacceptable.

Daniel's car sped toward Lakeside Residences.

Theodore and Evelyn's new home. After overhearing Evelyn mention her move yesterday, Daniel had ordered Ethan to track Theodore's address.

As Daniel parked, a moving van pulled away, leaving Evelyn and Theodore on the front steps. Evelyn carried a duffel while Theodore handled her suitcase. They disappeared inside before Daniel could approach.

After a moment's hesitation, Daniel exited his car and followed.

"There's a fantastic farmer's market nearby," Theodore was saying as the elevator doors opened. He wheeled Evelyn's suitcase down the hall, stopping at her door. "I'll take you tomorrow." With a warm smile, he turned to leave. "Get settled in. See you in the morning."

"Sounds perfect."

Though neighbors, their units weren't adjacent. Lakeside Residences featured studio apartments with six or seven units per floor. Evelyn lived three doors down from Theodore.

When signing the lease, the landlord had questioned why Evelyn didn't want the unit beside Theodore's. She'd explained that when Liam and Emily visited, their energy might disturb him. Maintaining respectful distance seemed prudent.

Theodore seemed to understand, departing without argument. Evelyn exhaled in relief, fishing for her keys.

As the door swung open, footsteps approached behind her, followed by her suitcase rolling forward. Assuming Theodore had returned, Evelyn laughed. "Changed your mind already?"

She held the door open as the person entered the dark apartment. Fumbling for the light switch, Evelyn finally illuminated the space.

The door slammed shut with startling force. Evelyn frowned. "Theo, I thought you said-"

Her words died as she turned. Daniel lounged elegantly on her couch, icy gaze locking onto hers. "Do I disappoint you that much?"
###Chapter 281

"You?"

Evelyn's voice froze when she recognized Daniel standing in her doorway.

She slammed the door shut behind her, leaning against it with crossed arms. Her icy gaze swept over him. "Shouldn't you be with your precious wife at this hour, Mr. Blackwood?"

It didn't surprise her that Daniel had tracked her down.

With his influence in Willowbrook, finding her new apartment was child's play.

Daniel stretched lazily on her sofa, an infuriating smirk playing on his lips.

He'd noticed her reaction. When Evelyn first heard the door open, she'd clearly expected Theodore. Her anger had been palpable.

But the moment she recognized Daniel, that hostility evaporated. Relief had flashed across her face before she masked it.

That reaction told him everything. In her heart, he was still someone she trusted.

Far more than that artist friend of hers, at least. "I came to apologize."

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "For letting your grandmother destroy my designs?"

She exhaled sharply. "You already made up for that with the two-day extension."

Her frosty glare could have frozen hell over. "If that's all, you can leave now."

Daniel shifted deeper into the sofa cushions, making himself at home.

Those dark, intense eyes locked onto hers. "I handled the media. Every trace of that incident was scrubbed from the internet thirty minutes ago."

Evelyn blinked, then remembered her threat in his office - she'd blackmailed him with security footage.

A bitter laugh escaped her. "And here I thought Mrs. Blackwood might throw a tantrum over you leaving her alone. But of course, you only came here to protect her reputation." She tilted her head. "Don't worry, I'll keep my word. The footage stays hidden as long as you cooperate."

Daniel's expression darkened at her sarcasm. "Diana doesn't know I'm here."

Evelyn scoffed. "Planning to be her silent martyr? Or do you want me to tell her what a devoted husband you are?"

"Evelyn!" Daniel's patience snapped.

He surged to his feet, eyes blazing. "Must you be like this? Even if we're not what we used to be, we're still colleagues! Friends! Is this how you talk to friends?"

Evelyn met his glare unflinchingly, her clear eyes turning glacial.

After a long silence, she spoke with deliberate precision: "We were never friends."

He didn't deserve that title. Not when he'd never been honest with her from the start.

"Get out."

She stepped aside and yanked the door open.

"Now."

Evelyn had been in high spirits all day while moving into her new place. Then Sophia's call came.

That one phone call shattered her mood completely.

Even Theodore had sensed something was wrong. He'd tactfully left after helping her unpack. Yet Daniel had the audacity to accuse her of having an attitude?

Did he expect her to welcome him with open arms?

"Evelyn!"

Her dismissal ignited Daniel's temper.

He knew Diana was at fault. He'd come here sincerely to make amends!

But Evelyn had not only implied he was unworthy of friendship - she'd actually ordered him to leave!

No woman had ever dared treat Daniel Blackwood this way.

In three strides, he reached her and kicked the door shut.

Before Evelyn could react, his hand closed around her throat, slamming her against the door.

"You've grown far too bold."
###Chapter 282

"You're the one being arrogant here!"

Evelyn clenched her jaw, her eyes burning with fury as she stared at Daniel. "Breaking into my home without permission. Who gave you the right to call me arrogant?"

Every line of her face radiated pure loathing toward him.

Daniel despised this version of Evelyn.

He hated the mocking glint in her eyes. The way she looked at him like he meant nothing. The complete indifference in her gaze.

His fingers tightened around her throat instinctively.

"I came to apologize properly today," he growled. "And to talk about Liam and Sophia."

At the mention of their children's names, Evelyn's heart twisted violently.

She shut her eyes, voice shaking. "Don't you dare say their names. You don't deserve them."

His grip tightened further.

Daniel possessed terrifying strength - enough to snap her delicate neck with minimal effort.

Evelyn endured the pain, forcing air into her lungs. "Sophia called me tonight," she rasped. "She was crying...sobbing about stomach pains."

Abruptly, he released her and turned away coldly. "She skipped dinner. That's why her stomach hurts."

Evelyn collapsed against the door, gasping. She pulled herself upright, leaning heavily against the wooden frame.

"Is that so?"

Tears glistened in her eyes from the earlier suffocation, but her gaze burned with quiet rage.

"During my pregnancy, her brothers absorbed most of the nutrients. She was born tiny and weak. The doctors gave her a month to live at most." Evelyn's voice cracked. "I fought every day to keep her alive. In six years with me, she never once had stomach issues. Never once called me crying in pain."

Daniel stiffened at her words.

His anger began dissolving under the weight of her icy accusations.

"Maybe she was faking it," he muttered. "Missing you too much."

"Daniel."

Evelyn wiped her tears away roughly. "Just admit you and Eleanor failed my daughter. You banned all snacks, fruits, milk. Forced them to eat only when adults did. No—wait until you decided to grace them with your presence. If you didn't show up, they starved."

His brows furrowed.

He'd installed signal jammers at home. Knew the kids were contacting Evelyn. Chose to ignore it.

But he never expected them to share these details.

"I had Diana change the rules yesterday. Today was different."

"Different?" Evelyn laughed bitterly. "Today you stuffed them with snacks too heavy for children to digest! Only stopped when they physically couldn't eat more! Their stomachs were in agony, yet you have the audacity to blame them for not eating dinner? If Isabelle hadn't given them medicine in time, they'd be hospitalized right now!"

Tears streamed down Evelyn's face.

Six years. Six years since she left Daniel. Only two days had broken her completely - learning about Oliver's leukemia, and tonight.

The post-birth plastic surgery to erase Luna Gibson's identity had been excruciating. Yet she never shed a tear.

But hearing her children suffer? That shattered her completely.

She hated herself for ever getting pregnant by Daniel. Hated her inability to protect them.

Her angels deserved none of this pain.

Daniel stood frozen, emotions warring within him as he watched Evelyn weep.

Taking a deep breath, he turned toward the door. "I'll check on them immediately."
###Chapter 283

Evelyn raised her chin defiantly, meeting Daniel's gaze with icy contempt. "How noble of you," she spat. "They're already asleep with medicine. What's the point of going back now? To wake them just so you can scold them for telling me the truth? Face it - you've always forbidden Liam and Emily from contacting me. You never wanted me near them! And yet you promised to protect them. Is this your idea of protection?"

Each syllable struck Daniel like a dagger to the chest.

His brows knitted together in frustration. "I had no idea about this!" he growled, voice thick with barely restrained anger. "When I was home, they said they weren't hungry. I didn't know anything was wrong!" He exhaled sharply, struggling to maintain control. "Stop blaming me for everything!"

Daniel's dark eyes burned into hers as he fought to keep his composure. "First, we don't even know if this is true - children exaggerate. Diana is their mother. She wouldn't hurt them intentionally. Even if she did, it's just differences in parenting styles. No mother would abuse her own children without reason."

Evelyn's lips curled in disgust. "No mother? You're living proof that monsters exist."

Her defiance ignited something primal in Daniel. He'd tried to be patient, but her relentless accusations pushed him past his limit.

Those crimson lips taunted him. He wanted to silence them, to make her stop speaking those poisonous words.

So he did.

Daniel moved with predatory grace. One hand pinned her wrist while the other braced against the door as he crushed his mouth against hers.

Evelyn's eyes flew wide in shock. Of all the reactions she'd anticipated, this violent passion wasn't one of them.

For a heartbeat, her mind went numb. Then reality crashed back. She thrashed wildly, pounding her fists against his chest, kicking, screaming every vile insult she could muster.

But their strength difference was insurmountable. She couldn't budge him an inch.

Pinned mercilessly against the door, Evelyn still fought like a caged animal. "Daniel, you bastard! Get off me! Leave!"

Every time their lips parted, she spat another curse, not realizing how her swollen lips and glittering tears only fueled his obsession.

Daniel couldn't stop. He devoured her protests, kissing her until her voice grew hoarse from screaming.

"Daniel, you sick pervert!" she finally rasped.

That word made his eyes darken dangerously. "You have no idea what a real pervert would do," he murmured, gaze dropping to her trembling mouth.

Evelyn shrank back instinctively. "Don't touch me! Go to your precious wife! Why are you even here?"

Daniel's attention remained fixed on those tempting lips. In the dim lighting, they looked like forbidden fruit.

"Daniel..." Her protest died as he tossed her onto the sofa.

Evelyn knew what came next. She squeezed her eyes shut, torn between reason and pride. Logic said she needed to placate him for Oliver's treatment. But her heart screamed that this man wasn't worth sacrificing her dignity for.
###Chapter 284

Enough of this.

Evelyn shut her eyes tight, forcing herself to believe this was just another cruel dream.

In this twisted fantasy, Daniel remained the charming man she'd foolishly fallen for years ago.

She gritted her teeth, reminding herself she was enduring this humiliation for Oliver's treatment.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Don't you already have Mrs. Blackwood? Shouldn't she satisfy you?"

Daniel's gaze darkened instantly. Frustration and anger warred within him as he bit down hard on her lower lip. "I've been occupied these past days, and Diana's been... unavailable." His voice turned mocking. "Happy with that answer?"

Evelyn's chuckle was ice against his ear. "So I'm just your convenient replacement when she's busy?"

Daniel said nothing. Instead, he pulled her into a crushing embrace, burying his face in the curve of her neck with exhausted resignation.

The truth was complicated.

Perhaps six years apart had eroded whatever connection he once shared with Diana. Perhaps he only loved the ghost of Evelyn Carter from the past, not the hardened woman before him now.

Logic demanded he maintain intimacy with Diana, yet his body rebelled every time.

But with Evelyn...

Reason screamed he should stay away, yet his traitorous body moved of its own accord.

After a suffocating silence, Evelyn drew a shaky breath. "Daniel."

No response came except the steady rhythm of his breathing against her skin. He'd fallen asleep.

Just like countless nights six years ago, he'd drifted off while holding her, breathing in her scent like some twisted comfort.

With careful movements, Evelyn pried herself free from his arms.

The dim bedroom lights cast long shadows across Daniel's exhausted face as he slept deeply on her couch.

Hatred burned in her chest.

How dare he sleep so peacefully in her presence?

A kitchen knife lay mere steps away. One quick slash could avenge the broken woman she'd been six years ago—the one who'd nearly lost everything.

This endless torment could finally end.

But then... a sigh.

She grabbed a spare blanket and draped it over him with trembling hands.

Oliver still needed treatment. Daniel couldn't die yet.

That night, Evelyn barely slept knowing he lay just beyond her bedroom door.

Daniel, however, slept more soundly than he had in weeks.

Ever since Diana's return, he'd hidden behind late nights at the office to avoid uncomfortable truths. Sleep had become a stranger.

Dawn arrived with the shrill ring of his phone.

Diana's whining voice pierced through. "Daniel! Where were you last night?"

He stretched lazily on the couch. "What do you want?"

"I searched everywhere! Not in your study, not in the guest room. I even drove to your office at midnight—nothing!" Her voice turned petulant. "Where did you go?"

Daniel ignored the question. "Is there a point to this?"

A dramatic sniffle. "Check the news! You promised if we removed all negative posts about Evelyn, she wouldn't release that awful video! But someone anonymously uploaded the gallery surveillance footage last night!"

Her voice cracked. "My PR team can't take it down! It's getting three times more views than yesterday's articles!"

A choked sob. "Everyone's attacking me! Daniel, what do I do now?"
###Chapter 285

Daniel pressed his fingers against his temples as a sharp pain throbbed behind his eyes.

He hadn’t touched a drop of alcohol last night, yet his head spun like he was nursing the worst hangover of his life.

Diana’s anxious voice crackled through the phone. "Daniel, are you still upset with me? I swear, I’ve realized my mistake. Jealousy made me irrational. Seeing Evelyn working so closely with you at Blackwood Group—it twisted something inside me."

She sniffled. "I’ve been thinking all night. I shouldn’t have escalated things by hiring that PR firm after the initial leak. I called them off by eight, but then…" Her voice wavered. "Someone anonymously posted that surveillance footage around ten. Now the whole internet is tearing me apart. What do I do?"

Daniel’s jaw tightened. "I’ll look into it."

"Okay." Diana’s voice was thick with tears. "Just…let me know. If it’s Evelyn behind this, I’ll apologize to her myself."

A beat of silence. Just as she was about to hang up, Daniel spoke again. "Where are Liam and Emily?"

The question caught her off guard.

"T-They’re…probably at preschool?"

"Is that so?"

Daniel’s gaze flicked to the calendar on Evelyn’s coffee table. Sunday.

The preschool had a strict policy—no classes on Sundays, giving families time together.

Diana had been in Willowbrook for nearly a week. Yet she didn’t even know her own children’s schedule.

The image of Evelyn leaning against the doorway last night, her voice sharp with accusation, flashed in his mind.

"Don’t worry about the kids today. Let Isabelle handle them."

Diana hesitated. Then it clicked—those little traitors must have tattled on her.

Smart little devils.

Suppressing her irritation, she forced sweetness into her tone. "Why? Are they upset with me? I was only trying to take care of them—"

Before she could finish, the bedroom door creaked open.

Daniel cut her off. "Just leave it to Isabelle. We’ll talk when I get back."

He ended the call and turned.

Evelyn stood there, arms crossed, still in her pajamas. The morning light haloed her face, making her skin glow. Her hair was slightly mussed, framing her delicate features.

Those dark eyes burned with pure disdain.

"You’re still here?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "Waiting for me to serve you breakfast?"

Daniel’s expression darkened. "Evelyn, remember who you’re speaking to. I’m still your boss."

She scoffed. "Oh, now you pull rank? Funny how that didn’t matter last night when you were acting completely inappropriate."

His frown deepened.

Last night.

The memory felt hazy, surreal.

Once was an accident. Twice? That was a pattern.

At least the first time, he could blame the alcohol—claim he’d mistaken her for Evelyn Carter.

Now? He had no excuse.
###Chapter 286

Daniel's latest excuse? He wasn't intoxicated.
Every moment, he knew exactly who she was - Evelyn Carter, not Evelyn Sinclair.

Then...
Ding-dong! The doorbell shattered the silence.

Theodore's worried voice followed. "How are you feeling? I brought breakfast. Come eat something."
He remembered how Diana's call had left Evelyn visibly shaken yesterday.

"Evelyn?"
Daniel's brow furrowed. As he moved to answer, Evelyn yanked him back.

"Don't humiliate me! You might not care, but I do!"
Her teeth sank into her lower lip as she shoved Daniel into the bedroom.

"Step one foot out and I'll release Diana's gallery footage immediately!"
She slammed the door, then hastily hid Daniel's shoes behind her suitcase.

After steadying her breath, Evelyn opened the door.

"You're awake?" Theodore's gentle chuckle filled the air as he brushed past her.
Evelyn scrambled after him helplessly.

"You're up early."
"My routine allows me to bring you breakfast daily from now on."

His gaze instantly caught the rumpled blanket on the sofa.
"You slept here last night?"

Evelyn hesitated before nodding. "The bedroom's still... chaotic. I haven't organized it yet."
Theodore placed the food on the coffee table. "Eat first. I'll organize your bedroom."

As he turned toward the closed door, Evelyn grabbed his arm. "No need! Keep me company instead. Eating alone is dreary."

Theodore's eyes flickered between the door and the suspicious shoes.
Finally, he smiled and sat opposite her.

"Alright, I'll stay."
Evelyn exhaled discreetly, forcing conversation between bites.

From the bedroom, Daniel listened intently.
Their initial chatter held his attention, but when they delved into art theory, his interest waned.

Turning, he surveyed Evelyn's immaculate bedroom - nothing like the mess she'd described.
The violet comforter and white desk gleamed under morning light.

A framed photo of Evelyn and Emily sat atop the desk, above a leather album.
Curiosity propelled him forward.

Flipping it open, he found no images of Evelyn with the twins.
Only photos with Emily, Liam, or the siblings together.

Liam dominated the collection.
Half showed him pulling ridiculous faces; the other half displayed unsettling maturity.

Daniel smirked.
The boy had dual personalities.

But subsequent pages erased his amusement.
Image after image showed Liam in hospital gowns, pallid and weak.

Some captured forced smiles during IV treatments.
Others showed him clutching Emily's hand with resigned tenderness.

Daniel's chest tightened.
What illness haunted this child?
###Chapter 287

"Don't touch that!"

Daniel was lost in thought when Evelyn's sharp voice cut through the silence.

Before he could react, she lunged forward and snatched the photo album from his grasp. "Who said you could go through my private things?"

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the leather-bound book. It had been Oliver's final gift - made during his long hospital stay after the leukemia diagnosis.

That bright-eyed boy had known too much about mortality for his age. "If I'm gone someday," he'd whispered, "just pretend Liam and I are the same person."

Daniel's gaze darkened. "Your son was seriously ill?"

"Just seasonal allergies." She turned away, carefully tucking the album into a drawer.

"Four months in Grandview Medical Center for allergies?" His voice turned icy. "I saw the dates on those hospital wristbands."

She spun around, eyes blazing. "Recurring infections. Satisfied?"

A humorless laugh escaped him. "Funny how you criticized my parenting, yet your child was hospitalized monthly."

Evelyn ignored the jab. "Theodore's picking me up for work soon. You should leave."

Daniel stretched across her bed, studying the ceiling. "Why does this feel like we're sneaking around?"

Her body went rigid. The irony burned - she'd become just like Serena, the woman who'd stolen Daniel from her years ago.

He handed her his phone without comment. The screen showed security footage from the gallery - Diana shoving Evelyn, ruining Theodore's masterpiece.

"You think I leaked this?" Her fingers tightened around the device.

"Impossible." He adjusted his position, arms behind his head. "This was posted anonymously at ten last night. You were... occupied."

Heat flooded her cheeks at the memory. She cleared her throat, returning the phone. "Then why show me?"

"Who else had access to this footage besides you and Theodore?"

Evelyn frowned. The counterfeit painting had been Theodore's secret - even the gallery manager was unaware. "No one."

The silence between them grew heavy with unspoken questions. Outside, a car horn sounded - Theodore's arrival slicing through the tension like a knife.
###Chapter 288

The only person Evelyn shared the video with was Oliver.
Oliver was mature for his age and wouldn't recklessly post something like that. There was no one else who could have accessed it.

"I'll give you twenty-four hours to think it over," Daniel said icily. "Compile a list of everyone who could've gotten their hands on that footage. I'll investigate each one personally."

Evelyn frowned. "If the video is damaging, why not just suppress it?"

Daniel's gaze turned glacial. "Because this affects Diana. I need to find the source and ensure they never leak anything again—so Diana doesn't suffer."

Evelyn nearly laughed at his hypocrisy.
He had slept with her last night, yet here he was, lying in her bed, worrying about Diana.
Planning how to clean up Diana's messes.

What a noble man.

The doorbell chimed again.
Theodore's warm voice filtered through. "Evelyn, ready to go?"

"Be right there," she called back before turning to Daniel.
With a sigh, she dug out a spare key and tossed it at him. "Wait five minutes before leaving. Lock up behind you."

After issuing her orders, she grabbed her coat and bag and walked out.

Theodore was leaning against the hallway wall, arms crossed.
"Finished giving orders?" he teased.

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

"Nothing." He smiled, guiding her toward the elevator with a hand on her shoulder. "I'll drive you to work."

The commute from Lakeside Residences to her office wasn't short—thirty minutes at least.
Evelyn was lost in thought, barely exchanging more than a few words with Theodore before silence settled between them.

At the twelve-minute mark, Theodore turned on the radio.

"Last night at ten, an anonymous account leaked security footage from the art gallery incident. The video clearly shows Diana Hart, wife of Daniel Blackwood, shoving Evelyn Carter toward the painting 'The Kite and The Maiden.'

"Initially, public sympathy leaned toward Diana after her favorite artwork was destroyed. Now, the truth is out—she was the one who ruined it!

"No wonder Mr. Blackwood was so quick to offer compensation. Claiming he 'saw nothing' was just a cover-up to protect his wife!"

Theodore snorted. "This is exactly how you deal with someone like Diana. Expose her lies and let the world see who she really is." He grinned at Evelyn. "Well played."

Evelyn stared out the window. "I didn't leak it. I only found out this morning."
She turned to him. "Besides me, who else did you send the video to?"

Theodore scratched his head, thinking hard before it clicked.
"Oh. I sent it to Diana."

Evelyn stiffened.
She whipped her head toward him. "You sent Diana the footage?"

"Yeah." He frowned. "After seeing how she bullied you yesterday—how she lied and manipulated Eleanor Blackwood into targeting you—I created a burner email and sent it to her. Warned her to back off before I exposed her."

He hesitated. "But I doubt she leaked it. Why would she post evidence that incriminates herself?"

Evelyn smirked, gazing out the window again.
"To anyone else, it would be unthinkable. But Diana? She'd do something this absurd without hesitation."
###Chapter 289

"Evelyn."

After parting ways with Theodore, Evelyn had just stepped into Blackwood Corporation when someone intercepted her.

It was none other than the woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to her past self—Diana Hart.

The lobby buzzed with activity.

Thanks to yesterday's headlines and today's viral video, every employee seemed aware of the tension between Evelyn and Diana.

All eyes were on them. Some stole glances discreetly, while others brazenly pulled out their phones to record.

Evelyn hated being the center of unwanted attention.

Her brows knitted as she leveled a frosty glare at Diana. "Get to the point."

Thud.

Without warning, Diana dropped to her knees before Evelyn. Gasps rippled through the lobby.

This was Diana Hart—Daniel Blackwood's wife!

The CEO's wife was kneeling before a mere employee!

Evelyn took a sharp step back, rubbing her temples. She'd been right in the car earlier—Diana was unhinged. She'd posted that damning video herself, inviting public ridicule.

And now? She'd cornered Evelyn in the lobby and knelt?

Evelyn tried retreating further, but the crowd hemmed her in. After two steps, she was trapped.

Exhaling through gritted teeth, she stared down at the weeping woman.

"Mrs. Blackwood, what game are you playing?"

"Please forgive me." Diana lifted tear-filled eyes. "I was wrong. I shouldn't have let jealousy consume me just because you work closely with Daniel."

Murmurs erupted. Was Diana admitting the video's authenticity?

Evelyn's frown deepened. This wasn't just an apology.

"Daniel hasn't come home for nights," Diana sniffled. "He claims he's working late, but when I check the office at midnight, he's never here."

A tear rolled down her cheek. "I know he must be with you, reviewing jewelry designs. Though we share a face, I lack your talent. Despite years of study, I'll never match your brilliance. That's why he won't let me join the design team."

Kneeling, Diana gazed up pitifully. "Please understand a wife's fears. I feel so... inadequate."

With calculated words, Diana had spun her assault on Evelyn into justified desperation.

Yes, she'd pushed Evelyn deliberately—but wouldn't any woman?

Who wouldn't rage if their husband vanished nightly to meet another woman?

The crowd's whispers turned sympathetic.

"Can you blame her? No wife would tolerate midnight meetings with a single woman."

"Exactly! Professionalism has limits. Who knows what really happens?"

"Stop making excuses for me," Diana interjected mournfully. "My actions were inexcusable. Ms. Carter is blameless. My love for Daniel blinded me. Even if she leaked that video, exposing me to cyberbullying... I deserved it."

She clasped trembling hands. "Ms. Carter, can you find it in your heart to forgive me? I swear I'll never interfere with your work again. No matter how late Daniel seeks you out, I'll stay silent. Just... please forgive this foolish wife."

On surface, Diana appeared to absolve Evelyn and Daniel.

In truth? She'd painted herself as the victim—the neglected spouse society would instinctively pity.

This was emotional blackmail.

Evelyn's eyes turned to ice.
###Chapter 290

Evelyn Carter's gaze dropped to Diana Hart kneeling on the marble floor.

"Impressive performance, Mrs. Blackwood."

Tears welled in Diana's eyes as she looked up. "You still won't forgive me, will you?"

"She barely touched you! It was just some stupid painting!"

"Daniel already compensated for the damage. It's not like it came from your pocket. Why can't you let this go?"

"And what kind of respectable woman works alone with another woman's husband until midnight? Who do you think you're fooling?"

"The wife was just putting the mistress in her place. Now that she's begging for forgiveness, the mistress refuses? What kind of twisted logic is that?"

"Everyone knows they were involved long before Mrs. Blackwood returned from abroad. The announcement was just for show."

Diana turned toward the murmuring crowd with watery eyes. "Stop these lies! My husband treats me wonderfully. I know exactly how much he loves me. He just...got momentarily distracted."

Evelyn watched the spectacle unfold with cold amusement. Diana hadn't come to apologize at this ungodly hour - this was another calculated attack.

"Mrs. Blackwood, if you enjoy theater so much, feel free to continue your one-woman show. I won't be participating."

As Evelyn moved to leave, the crowd blocked her path.

"Look how guilty she looks! Trying to run away!"

"Don't let her escape!"

"She leaves only after forgiving Mrs. Blackwood!"

The orchestrated mob hurled unreasonable demands. Evelyn couldn't push through.

This was no coincidence. Diana had planted these people.

Evelyn's sharp gaze returned to Diana, catching the venomous smirk beneath her performative tears. "Please, Evelyn. Forgive me."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Diana had boxed her in perfectly - refuse forgiveness and face the mob's wrath, or capitulate and admit to being the other woman.

A slow smile curved Evelyn's lips as she glanced toward the entrance. "You thought you had me cornered because Daniel isn't here?"

Diana blinked rapidly. "I just want your forgiveness."

With a derisive snort, Evelyn pulled out her phone. "I'm being detained by an angry mob in the lobby."

"Understood!" came the immediate response.

Within two minutes, Tyler Walsh and Dominic Shaw burst through the doors with a security team. The imposing men easily dispersed the crowd, clearing a path.

"Ms. Carter." Tyler bowed slightly. "Our apologies for the delay."

"Perfect timing." Evelyn turned her attention back to the stunned Diana. "Let me make three things crystal clear."

"First, I didn't leak that video or orchestrate the online harassment. You know exactly who did."

"Second, even if your apology were genuine, I wouldn't accept it. Save your manipulative theatrics."

"Finally," Evelyn's voice turned icy, "if Daniel hasn't been home, that's between you two. Don't you dare try pinning that on me."

With that, Evelyn strode away flanked by security, leaving stunned silence in her wake.

The two men helped Diana up. "Why didn't you stop them?" she hissed.

"We could've handled her, but those bodyguards..."

Tyler and Dominic were trained professionals - no match for hired muscle.

"Useless!" Diana spat as the security team passed by. She blocked their path. "As Blackwood employees, how dare you take orders from some designer instead of the CEO's wife?"

The men exchanged amused glances. "We answer to one person only."

"Daniel Blackwood?"

"Liam Carter."
###Chapter 291

Grandview Medical Center.

Sophia sat on a bench, swinging her legs as she enjoyed her lollipop.

Her big dark eyes peered through the glass window. Inside, Daniel was wrestling with a little boy, trying to hold him still so the doctor could draw blood.

"Uncle Ethan, is Daddy mad today?"

It was the weekend. Sophia and Liam finally didn’t have to go to preschool. They’d planned to sleep in, but Daniel had stormed into their rooms at dawn and dragged them straight to the hospital for a full checkup.

Especially Liam.

He’d been subjected to way more tests than she had.

Ethan wiped his forehead, unsure how to explain. "Uh…maybe Mr. Blackwood just thought it was time for both of you to get checked up…"

Truthfully, Ethan had no idea what Daniel was thinking either.

When he’d arrived at Blackwood Group that morning, he’d spotted Diana huddled with a few men near the entrance, whispering among themselves.

Assuming Diana was snooping, Ethan had panicked. Daniel hadn’t been home or working late the night before, so he’d immediately called him, warning that Diana was at the office looking for him. He’d asked if Daniel wanted to be picked up.

But when he arrived, Daniel had insisted on going home first instead of heading straight to work.

And now here they were—hours into an endless series of medical tests.

"Why does Liam have more tests than me?"

Sophia sucked on her lollipop, watching the chaotic father-son struggle inside.

"Liam hates checkups. I don’t mind them as much. Why is Daddy making it worse for him?"

Ethan wiped his brow again. "Uh…"

He was just as lost.

Daniel had ordered every test imaginable—leukemia screenings, cancer panels, the works.

Liam was the picture of health. Why would Daniel think he was sick?

"I’m done!" Inside the exam room, Liam snapped when the doctor mentioned another test.

"Daniel Blackwood, what’s your problem? I’m fine! Why are you torturing me with all these tests?"

Even his twin, Oliver, had never gone through this many. Was Daniel insane? He could’ve been sleeping in, but instead, he’d been dragged here for two hours of pointless poking and prodding.

Daniel stared at him coldly. "You? Fine?"

"Obviously!" Liam rolled his eyes. "I barely even get sick!"

Daniel smirked. He pulled out his phone and showed Liam a photo—a boy in a hospital gown, lying weakly in bed.

"Care to explain?"

Liam took the phone. The second he saw the image, everything clicked.

It was Oliver.

Identical twins meant identical faces. Daniel had mistaken him for his brother.

Liam exhaled sharply. "Yeah, that’s me. So?"

Daniel scoffed. "You rarely get sick?"

"Exactly. That’s why when I do get sick, it’s bad enough to land me in the hospital."

He pouted. "And why do you even have this picture? I look terrible."
###Chapter 292

Liam instantly erased the photograph.

Even though he bore an uncanny resemblance to Oliver, a keen observer might spot slight variations.

Daniel was notoriously detail-oriented, and Liam couldn't risk him noticing.

After deleting the image, he handed the phone back. "What other tests do you need? I'll cooperate—but no more interruptions for the rest of the day."

Daniel frowned. "Why the sudden change of heart?"

Ever since they'd arrived at Grandview Medical Center, Liam had been uncooperative. That was why Daniel had been hovering over them.

Yet now, after seeing that photo, Liam was complying without protest?

Liam scoffed. "I thought you were just waiting for us to drop dead. But after seeing that picture, I realized you actually care. Fine. I'll humor you."

Without another word, he rolled up his sleeve and let the nurse draw blood.

Relieved by his cooperation, Daniel exhaled and stepped out.

In the hallway, Sophia was on her third lollipop. She pressed her lips together when she saw Daniel but stayed silent.

He sat beside her, taking a measured breath.

"I heard your stomach was upset last night?"

Sophia's eyes narrowed with resentment. "Try chugging three bottles of milk in an hour and see how your stomach feels."

Daniel's jaw tightened. "How many did you drink?"

"Three. Liam had five."

She crossed her arms, pouting. "That lunatic said we had to finish ten bottles, or she'd lock us in the dark room again. She claimed if we complained about snacks and drinks, she'd make sure we never went thirsty."

The memory of Diana's cold glare made Sophia shiver. "We tried, but ten bottles was impossible. If Isabelle hadn’t sneaked us two and a half, we’d still be trapped!"

Daniel's chest burned with fury.

"Do you have any proof of this?"

Sophia shook her head. "Liam had some recording devices, but after she yelled at us, she tore through our room. Took everything—phones, tablets, even his spy gadgets."

She sighed dramatically. "We had no choice but to suffer in silence!"

Daniel's frown deepened. He could almost understand Diana's strictness about meals—maybe she wanted to instill discipline, even if her methods were extreme.

But this? Forcing children to drink excessive milk as punishment?

This wasn’t discipline. It was cruelty.

Because he’d confronted her, she’d taken it out on them.

He turned to Ethan, who stood behind him. "You said Diana was at the office this morning?"

Ethan hesitated. "Yes, but... I just received something anonymously. You should see it."

Daniel took the phone.

The video showed Diana on her knees, pleading with Evelyn.

"Ms. Evelyn, please forgive me. I swear I won’t interfere with you and Daniel. No matter how late he stays with you, I won’t say a word. I’ll never hurt you again."

Daniel’s calm shattered into white-hot rage.
###Chapter 293

Daniel's fingers tightened around his phone as he ended the call. He immediately dialed Diana's number.

The moment the line connected, a familiar ringtone echoed from the elevator lobby down the hall.

Daniel turned sharply.

There she was—Diana, her face streaked with tears, rushing toward him in a frenzy. "Are Liam and Emily okay? Why did they need a checkup?"

The sight of her tearful, panicked expression sent a wave of disgust crashing through him.

Earlier, when he had gone home to pick up the children, he had specifically asked Isabelle if Diana knew about their suffering the night before.

"After you left last night, Mrs. Blackwood went into her room and didn't come out again," Isabelle had said. "This morning, she barely glanced at them before leaving for breakfast and heading straight out."

Her words still burned in his ears. "She made them drink milk and never checked on them again."

Now, as Diana approached with those crocodile tears, Daniel felt nothing but bitterness.

This was the woman he had loved. The one he had waited six years for.

Yet now, faced with her, he barely recognized her.

Was this really the same Evelyn Carter he had once known?

Even now, staring at her tears, he couldn’t tell if they were real or just another act.

Diana had sworn she was Liam and Emily’s mother. She had claimed that losing them had nearly destroyed her.

But in the short time she’d been back, she had shown nothing but indifference toward them.

This wasn’t how a mother who missed her children should behave.

"Daniel!"

She reached him, breathless, her hands trembling as she clutched his arm. "Daniel, what’s wrong with them? I just got home when Isabelle told me you and Ethan took them to the hospital!"

She wiped at her cheeks dramatically. "I came as fast as I could. What happened?"

Before Daniel could respond, Emily rolled her eyes. "We’re fine. Daddy just wanted to make sure we weren’t sick from drinking too much milk."

The tension in Diana’s shoulders eased slightly.

Good. It wasn’t a DNA test.

Her frantic rush to the hospital hadn’t been out of concern for the children—it was fear of being exposed.

Liam and Emily had promised not to push Daniel into testing her, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t get suspicious on his own.

Relieved, Diana shot Emily a scolding look. "I told you not to snack so much! Look what happened—you drank so much milk you couldn’t even eat properly. Next time, listen to me. Eat your meals on time and cut back on snacks, understand?"

Then she turned to Daniel, smug. "See, Daniel? This is what happens when you indulge them. Maybe you should leave their care to me—"

"Leave them to you so you can keep neglecting them?" Daniel cut in coldly.

His gaze was sharp, unrelenting. "Diana, has Evelyn been raising your children for the past six years that you find them such a burden? If that’s the case..."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "I’d rather let Evelyn keep them."

"Yay!" Emily clapped excitedly. "I get to stay with Mommy!"

Diana’s face paled. She grabbed Daniel’s arm. "Daniel, what are you saying?"

"What am I saying?" His voice was dangerously low. "Diana, what did you promise when you first came back? You said you loved them. That even if they didn’t like you, you’d win them over with patience. You swore you’d take care of them so well they’d forget about Evelyn. So tell me—what happened?"

He pulled out the medical report. "The doctor said if it weren’t for the medication, they would’ve been hospitalized last night. When Evelyn told me you forced them to drink so much they couldn’t eat dinner, I didn’t believe her. I thought—as their mother—you’d never stoop so low!"
###Chapter 294

"The evidence is right here. Should I keep pretending you're innocent?"

Diana's face drained of color as Daniel's words hit her. Her fingers trembled around the medical report.

She had confiscated all electronics from the children's rooms the night before. Then she forced them to drink ten bottles of milk as punishment for defying her.

Milk couldn’t kill anyone—or so she thought. At worst, they’d be too bloated to move.

Without recordings, she could claim the kids hated her and made up lies.

But she never expected their young stomachs would show physical signs of distress.

Diana clutched the report, silent for a long moment.

Finally, she looked up at Daniel with tears streaming down her face. "Daniel, let me explain..." She wiped her cheeks. "I wasn’t a good mother, but I had my reasons..."

She grabbed his sleeve desperately. "When I came back, I thought we’d be happy—you, me, and the kids. But everything changed."

Her voice cracked. "You never touched me. Not once. You always said you were working late, but when I checked your office, you were never there."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "I saw you guarding Evelyn’s friend’s house all night. And last night..." She sniffled. "Did you really think I didn’t know where you were?"

Daniel’s expression softened. She wasn’t wrong—he had been avoiding her.

"My mind is slipping," she whispered. "I don’t know how things got this bad. You used to love me. But my mental state... I was afraid to be near the kids. I didn’t want to hurt them."

Her shoulders slumped. "But I already did."

Turning, she knelt beside Emily with tear-filled eyes. "Sweetheart, Mommy was wrong. Can you forgive me? I only acted this way because I love your daddy too much..."

Daniel’s chest tightened. Maybe he’d pushed her too far. Her instability explained her actions.

This was his fault.

He exhaled and wiped her tears. "I’m sorry. Focus on getting better. I’ll arrange someone else to care for the children."

Diana nodded meekly. "Okay."

Inside, she was triumphant. Did they really think she wanted those brats around? This was perfect.

She’d always feared Daniel would blame her if anything happened to them. But if they were under someone else’s care...

An "accident" wouldn’t trace back to her.

"Emily." Daniel gently touched the girl’s head. "Discuss with Liam what kind of nanny you’d like."

Isabelle couldn’t handle both children alone.

Emily beamed. "No need to discuss! There’s someone Liam will definitely agree to!"

Diana feigned concern. "Who? Just tell Daddy, and—"

"Our real mommy," Emily declared. "Evelyn."
###Chapter 295

Diana's words drained all color from Evelyn's face, leaving her paler than the hospital walls.

The hallway fell into absolute silence.

Then, the testing room door swung open. Liam stepped out, adjusting his sleeves.

His gaze immediately landed on Evelyn, whose eyes shimmered with unshed tears. A smirk tugged at his lips. Pathetic. This woman only had three modes—crying, sobbing, or screaming.

Right now, she still had Daniel wrapped around her finger, so her tears worked. But once he grew tired of her? Those same tears would only irritate him.

Tch.

Adults should know better. Tears lost their power when overused.

Liam strolled to Sophia's side and took a seat, clasping her small hand. "Why is Ms. Diana crying?"

Daniel frowned, but Sophia answered first.

"She's upset because Daddy keeps looking for Mommy," she chirped. "So she's taking it out on us. But Daddy just said she doesn’t have to watch us anymore. He let us pick our own nanny—and I chose our Mommy, Evelyn. What do you think?"

Liam instantly understood the tension between the adults.

"That idea is... mediocre."

Sophia's eyes widened. "You don’t want to live with Mommy?"

"Of course I do." Liam lowered his head, smoothing his clothes. "But let’s be honest. Evelyn Carter is our biological mother. Having the other woman—" He shot Diana a pointed look. "—take care of us while our real mom suspects Daddy and fights with him? That’s just wrong."

His words were deliberate. By naming Evelyn as their mother, he stripped Diana of that title—implying she was the mistress.

Diana’s face whitened. She understood the insult but couldn’t call him out. Instead, she forced a smile. "You’re right. Evelyn taking care of you two would be inappropriate."

Liam yawned, turning to Daniel. "Mr. Blackwood, letting someone else raise us isn’t right. We’re proof of your love with Evelyn Carter. When she doubts you, we’re what she should fight for."

His gaze flicked back to Diana. "Don’t you agree?"

Diana’s face twisted from pale to livid. She glared before gritting out, "Yes."

"Since we’re all in agreement..." Daniel checked his watch. "Isabelle and Diana will continue supervising you."

He nodded at Ethan. "Take them home. Diana and I need to talk."

Ethan stepped forward. "Young Master, Little Princess, let’s go."

Sophia scowled, yanking her hand from Liam’s and stomping off.

Liam smirked at Diana. "Have fun with Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Diana!"

Then he dashed after Sophia. "Wait for me!"

Ethan sighed, chasing them. "Liam, slow down!"
###Chapter 296

Diana stood frozen in the hospital corridor, watching Daniel walk away. A flicker of resentment burned in her gaze.

That clever little brat. He knew exactly what she would do if she lost control over them. So he’d twisted Daniel’s decision with flawless logic, leaving no room for argument.

The thought of still having to play the doting caretaker made her blood boil.

As she stared blankly after Daniel, his sharp voice snapped her back. "Diana."

She flinched, quickly schooling her expression. "Let's go."

Daniel led her to a café near Grandview Medical Center—the first time he’d taken her there since their wedding.

Before marriage, he hadn’t known her well. To him, she’d just been a woman hopelessly in love. Back then, buried under family expectations and work stress, he’d been drowning in gloom.

She had been his unexpected sunlight.

Sketching for him, leaving little gifts, humming unfamiliar melodies.

Eventually, he started confiding in her.

When they discussed marriage, she’d paused, then grabbed his arm with those wide, shimmering eyes.

"You think marriage is a chain, but to me, it’s happiness. Marrying you would be a dream."

Her innocence had amused him. "Even if I never love you?"

"Of course."

He could still picture the way she’d blinked at him.

Now, seated across from her, she was just as stunning, her voice just as soft.

But her eyes were different.

"Daniel." Her gentle call pulled him from his thoughts.

He exhaled, gripping his coffee. "I heard you went to the office earlier."

Her fingers trembled around her cup.

She lifted tear-filled eyes. "I only went to see Evelyn because—"

"Because you think she’s the other woman." He took a slow sip. "At the hospital, you claimed you saw me outside Grace’s place. If that’s true, you’d know I never went inside. I just smoked outside. Yet at the office, you lied. Said I was there with Evelyn, discussing designs."

His gaze turned icy. "I get your suspicion. And I’ll admit, much of this is my fault. But you could’ve talked to me."

Her nails dug into her palms. She forced a fragile smile.

"I…was scared. I thought you’d be angry."

"Do I look pleased now?" His laugh was bitter. "Our problems are between us. Evelyn didn’t even know I was there. Yet you spread lies, slandered her."

He studied her, voice dropping. "I don’t know if you were always like this, or if six years changed you."
###Chapter 297

The air between them froze instantly.

Evelyn raised her gaze, locking eyes with Daniel with unwavering intensity. "Daniel, I did all of this for you."

"For me?"

Daniel let out a bitter chuckle. "You deliberately pushed Serena and destroyed Theodore's artwork—for me? Because of me, you hired a PR firm to leak that video online? And let's not forget how you knelt in front of Evelyn in my office, making it seem like she seduced me?"

He took a sharp sip of coffee before slamming the cup down. The sharp clatter against the marble table echoed like a gunshot in Diana's chest.

She sniffled, forcing tears to well in her eyes. "Daniel, I know I was wrong, but isn't this what women in high society do to protect their families?"

Daniel felt his patience snap.

The Evelyn Carter from six years ago would never have stooped to this.

Yet here Diana was, constantly flaunting status and privilege, as if it justified everything.

He tugged at his cufflinks in irritation. "You've changed too much in six years."

Diana bit her lip.

She reached for his hand, desperation lacing her voice. "Daniel, please forgive me. I just... I don’t feel secure."

That made him laugh—a cold, humorless sound.

"Six years. I waited for you. Searched for you. And now you tell me you don’t feel secure?"

His glare could have cut glass. "Should I lock you in my office 24/7 to make you feel safe?"

His phone buzzed.

Without glancing at the screen, he rejected the call.

"Maybe this is my fault." He pinched the bridge of his nose. "We need time apart."

Diana stiffened. "Time apart?"

"Yes." Daniel leaned back, exhaustion lining his features. "I thought you were different. But we've both changed. We need to reconsider everything—whether we stay married or end this for good. Starting tonight, you take the master bedroom. I’ll sleep in the guest room."

He stood, straightening his tie. "I have work to do."

Diana’s nails dug into her palms.

"Daniel." Her voice trembled. "Are we really... over?"

"For now."

"How long?"

"We’ll see." He couldn’t stand the hurt in her voice, but the things she’d done—

"I’ll find out who leaked that video."

At the mention of the video, Diana perked up. "It was Evelyn! You said yourself she had the footage. After I took down the news last night, she posted it at ten. That anonymous account has to be hers!"

Daniel’s expression turned glacial. "It wasn’t her."

"How do you know?"

"Because I know exactly where she was at ten last night."

The implication hung in the air like a blade.

Diana’s face drained of color.

She knew exactly what he meant.

Last night, he had been with Evelyn.
###Chapter 298

The revelation Mr. Prescott had shared with Diana that night flashed before Evelyn's eyes unbidden.

Her jaw clenched. Serena had to disappear. As long as Serena remained, Daniel would never be hers.

It had been true years ago, and it would remain true now.

Evelyn spent the morning painstakingly recreating the design sketches Eleanor Blackwood had destroyed, refining certain details as she worked.

By noon, she stretched, her muscles protesting, and decided to head downstairs for lunch.

The moment she stepped outside, reporters swarmed her.

"Ms. Carter, rumors claim you leaked the video of Mrs. Blackwood pushing you to combat yesterday's scandal. Care to comment?"

"Ms. Carter, footage surfaced online showing Mrs. Blackwood kneeling before you in the office lobby, begging for forgiveness. Is this accurate?"

"How do you justify inserting yourself as the other woman between Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood?"

"Doesn’t it shame you, meddling in someone else’s marriage?"

Their questions were sharp, deliberate—each one designed to wound.

Evelyn’s brow furrowed. She was about to signal for Tyler and Dominic when a calm, authoritative voice cut through the chaos.

"A press conference will be held tomorrow to address these matters formally."

She turned, startled.

Standing there was Richard Sinclair—her father.

Evelyn stared. "What are you doing here?"

He didn’t meet her gaze, addressing the reporters instead. "I’m Mrs. Blackwood’s father. Regarding Ms. Carter’s involvement with my daughter, all questions will be answered tomorrow."

Then, to the press’s stunned silence, he gripped Evelyn’s sleeve and pulled her away.

The gesture was achingly familiar.

Despite the years, despite the estrangement, the way he tugged her along—just as he had when she was small—sent a pang through her chest.

They walked until they reached a dilapidated apartment. The air inside was thick with mildew.

"Ms. Carter." Richard cleared his throat.

Evelyn blinked, taking in the cramped space. Sunlight filtered through grimy windows, casting oppressive streaks across the floor.

"Tea?" Victoria offered hesitantly, placing a chipped cup before her.

Evelyn frowned. "Why are you living like this?"

The Sinclairs weren’t wealthy, but they’d never been destitute.

Victoria and Richard exchanged glances.

"We sold everything in Mariner’s Cove," Victoria admitted.

She sighed. "Daniel claimed he sent Serena abroad for schooling. In truth, it’s a locked facility—no different from prison."

"We reached out to the Prescotts. They demanded five million for her freedom. She could go anywhere—except Willowbrook."

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

"So you bankrupted yourselves for Serena?"

Victoria nodded. "A child’s freedom is priceless."

Evelyn almost laughed. Victoria still didn’t know Serena wasn’t her daughter.

She met Richard’s eyes. "Why bring me here?"

"We want to help you clear Diana’s name at the press conference."

Victoria leaned forward. "Diana is Daniel’s wife now. If she repays us, we won’t have to live like this."
###Chapter 299

Evelyn stopped dead in her tracks.

She hadn't noticed how hard her nails were biting into her palms.

"So, you dragged me here just to convince me to hold a press conference—to prove Diana is some kind of saint? All so you can cozy up to her and beg for money?"

Victoria exhaled sharply. "I know you must think we're pathetic. But as parents, if there was any way to free our child from prison, wouldn't you take it? We're only doing this because we love Serena too much."

Then she lifted her gaze, pleading. "Ms. Carter, you know I wronged Diana Hart—formerly Evelyn Carter—in the past. She despises me. That's why we couldn't approach her directly. If you'd just hold that press conference tomorrow, clear her name, make the internet stop attacking her... Maybe then she'd see how much we're suffering. Maybe then she'd give us the money we need."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Richard and Victoria had gone through all this trouble just to use her as bait—to soften Diana up before shaking her down for cash.

To them, Serena would always come first. They'd sell everything they owned for her. The only reason they wanted to reconcile with Evelyn now was because she was Daniel Blackwood's wife.

"Sorry," Evelyn said flatly, watching the steam curl from her untouched tea. "I won't help you. First, this whole mess is Diana's doing—she's trying to ruin me. Second, I have zero reason to lift a finger for you. And third—" Her icy stare cut through them both. "If Serena is the only daughter you've ever cared about, then act like it. You never gave Evelyn Carter an ounce of love growing up. Don't crawl to her now. Have some self-respect."

She turned to leave.

Victoria's face twisted. She lunged after her.

"Ms. Carter!"

She caught Evelyn by the arm. "I get it—you hate how we dote on Serena while treating Evelyn like garbage. But you don't know the whole story. Serena almost died during childbirth. She was stuck in my womb too long—they said it made her... slower. That's why I spoil her. She's my flesh and blood—"

Evelyn whirled around. "Are you sure Serena is yours?"

Victoria blinked. "O-Of course—"

Where else would Serena have come from?

Evelyn took a sharp breath. "When Serena was a baby, there was a mix-up at the orphanage. Someone accidentally took the wrong child. Remember?"

Victoria stiffened. "Yes..."

It happened when Serena was just a month old. After Evelyn and Victoria got in the car, Richard was supposed to strap the baby in. But when they drove off, they realized he'd grabbed the wrong infant. They'd rushed back to swap them.

"How do you know about that?"

Evelyn's lips curled. "Oh, I know more than that. I know Serena might not be your biological daughter at all."

"Ridiculous!" Victoria barked a laugh. "She looks exactly like my husband! Anyone can see she's his!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "And you? Does she look like you?"

Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Think about it."
###Chapter 300

Evelyn inhaled sharply before turning away.

Victoria lingered for what felt like hours before finally dragging herself home, shoulders slumped in defeat.

The moment she stepped inside, Richard was already striding toward her. "Well?"

She shook her head. "She refused. Said she won't agree to our terms, and she definitely won't attend the press conference."

Richard's expression darkened. "Did she say anything else?"

Victoria hesitated. "She... told me to double-check. That Diana might not actually be my daughter."

A visible tremor ran through Richard. His face drained of color.

"Ridiculous," Victoria scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. "Since when has Evelyn ever been trustworthy? We shouldn't rely on her."

"Exactly. How could Diana not be yours?" Richard's jaw clenched as he stared blankly ahead.

A heavy silence settled between them before Victoria sighed. "If Evelyn won't help... then I have no choice but to go to Diana."

"Ma'am, you have visitors."

Diana had been sprawled across her bed in Silvercrest Manor, glaring at the ceiling since returning from the café. She barely registered the servant's voice until the words sank in.

"Can't you see I'm resting?" she snapped. "I don't care who it is. Make them wait."

The only person she wanted to see was Daniel. Anyone else could rot.

"But, Ma'am—" The servant hesitated. "The man claims to be your father. Richard Sinclair."

Diana bolted upright. "My father?" A slow smirk curled her lips. "Prepare the best tea. I'll be right down."

As the servant scurried off, Diana sauntered to her wardrobe, selecting an elegant dress with deliberate care.

Perfect timing.

She'd been brainstorming ways to deal with Evelyn, and now her so-called father had delivered himself straight to her doorstep.

Evelyn spent the afternoon sketching in her office after a quick lunch, trying to push the earlier confrontation from her mind.

She'd barely finished a rough outline when another knock interrupted her.

"Director Carter, there's a woman here to see you. Victoria Sinclair. She says it's urgent."

Evelyn's pencil stilled.

She knew exactly why Victoria was here. Diana must have sent her.

"Tell her I'm unavailable."

The assistant shifted uncomfortably. "She said... she'll wait until you leave. That you'll have to come out eventually."

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. "Fine. Let her in."

Some habits were hard to break—like her inability to turn away someone in distress.

The moment Victoria stepped inside, she dropped to her knees. Tears streamed down her face as she clutched Evelyn's desk.

"Please," she begged. "You have to help us!"

Evelyn recoiled, immediately pulling her up. "What's wrong?"

Victoria's voice cracked. "Richard—he collapsed. A stroke. The hospital bills... we can't afford them!"

Her sobs echoed through the office. "You're our only hope!"
###Chapter 301

Evelyn helped Victoria up and guided her to the sofa. "You're asking for my help. What exactly do you want me to do?"

Her voice was steady, but her fingers tightened around the armrest. "Hold a press conference and declare myself the mistress? Admit that Diana was justified in pushing me?"

Victoria flinched, her lips trembling.

"Ms. Evelyn, I know this is difficult, but we have no other choice."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She stood and walked to her desk, pulling open a drawer. A sleek black card slid into her palm.

She held it out. "There's half a million here. Consider it a loan." Her tone left no room for negotiation. "But I won't lie to the public. That's non-negotiable."

Victoria stared at the card, her face flickering between shame and desperation.

Finally, she pushed it back. "I can't take your money. My daughter has funds. If you'd just—"

"Then we're done here." Evelyn tucked the card away. "I won't help you, Victoria. Please leave."

Ever since they'd begged her to drop charges against Serena at the police station, Evelyn had severed ties with the Sinclair family.

They were strangers now. The money had been her last act of kindness.

To publicly humiliate herself and absolve Diana? Never.

"Ms. Evelyn..." Tears spilled down Victoria's cheeks. "I'm not lying. My husband had a stroke. He's at Grandview Medical Center. He said... if he doesn't make it, his biggest regret is never apologizing to you properly."

Apologizing.

The word struck like a blade. Evelyn turned away, jaw clenched. "There's nothing to apologize for."

Why should she care about their struggles? They'd stopped being her family long ago.

"Name your price," Victoria whispered, sinking to her knees again. "I'll do anything. Please."

The door swung open.

Theodore froze at the sight of Victoria on the floor. He rushed forward, pulling her up. "What's going on?"

Victoria clutched his sleeve, pouring out the press conference plea. "You're Evelyn's friend—convince her. It's charity work, really."

Theodore hesitated, then nodded. "I promise. We'll be there tomorrow. Okay?"

Victoria's breath hitched. "Thank you—"

"Don't mention it." He ushered her out with a reassuring smile. "It's handled."

When he returned, Evelyn was sketching again, her pencil strokes sharp.

"So," she said without looking up, "how exactly do you plan to convince me?"

Theodore leaned against her desk. "I'm not." His voice was calm. "Diana's guilty. Clearing her name would be a lie."

Evelyn's pencil stilled.

"And I don't do lies."
###Chapter 302

Theodore smirked. "I never intended to let you help clear her name."

He stretched lazily before sinking into the plush sofa, his gaze steady on Evelyn. "Earlier, you called about Diana and Richard's little predicament. I decided to pay them a visit—thought I'd play the philanthropist and secure them better accommodations. But guess what I discovered?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled over her paperwork. She lifted her eyes, brows knitting together.

"I saw Richard sneaking into Silvercrest Manor. Not long after he returned, an ambulance whisked him away. Naturally, I followed them to Grandview Medical Center. After some... persuasion, a nurse finally spilled the truth."

A beat of silence. "How is he?"

"Faking it," Theodore snorted. "Perfectly healthy. The stroke was just an act."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, a bitter laugh escaping her.

Of course. Diana and Richard only ever cared about themselves.

"Then why did you agree to help Diana?"

"Had to," Theodore said, winking. "If Richard visited Silvercrest Manor, Diana already knows about the press conference. I promised I'd attend—but I never said I'd clear her name. Or yours." His grin turned wicked. "Isn't it delicious? Letting her cling to hope, waiting for you to defend yourself... when you never will."

Evelyn shot him an exasperated look.

"Artists," she muttered. She had no intention of addressing the rumors. If she wasted energy refuting every lie, she'd be drained before thirty.

"I'm just looking out for you," Theodore purred, lifting his teacup. "See how much I adore you?"

The office door swung open.

Daniel stood framed in the doorway, expression stormy. His icy glare swept from Theodore to Evelyn.

"Director Carter." His voice was clipped. "Company policy prohibits non-work-related conversations during business hours." His attention snapped to Theodore. "Leave."

Theodore merely shrugged, sipping his tea. "If I'm family, then it's work-related, no?"

"Whose family?"

"Her boyfriend." Theodore met Daniel's glare with a smirk. "Didn't you know, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel's lips curled. "A boyfriend who's never even held her hand?"

Theodore rolled his eyes. "How would you know that?" He drained his cup. "I'm pursuing Evelyn because we're both single. Unlike you—engaged, yet still sniffing around other women."

Setting the cup down, Theodore leaned toward Evelyn, voice dripping with sweetness. "I'll pick you up after work."

With that, he strolled out, leaving Daniel seething. Only when Theodore vanished did Daniel release a sharp exhale and drop onto the sofa.

"If I catch him here again during work hours," he growled, "Liam and Emily won't see you for a month."

Evelyn set her pen down with deliberate calm. "Mr. Blackwood, you claim my friend is a distraction. So tell me—what exactly are you here for?"
###Chapter 303

Daniel studied Evelyn's tense expression. Memories of her face from the previous night flashed through his mind.

He steadied himself and offered a reassuring smile. "Relax. What happened last night won't repeat itself."

Evelyn shot him a sharp glare. "You're not invited."

Daniel leaned back against the sofa, unfazed. "What if I bring Liam and Emily along?"

Liam and Emily.

It had been nearly a week since Evelyn last saw them. Though they secretly called her every night, hearing their voices wasn't the same as holding them close. And after what happened the night before—when they'd nearly fallen ill—

Her gaze turned icy. "Fine. For Liam and Emily, I'll tolerate your presence."

After arranging for dinner at her place that evening, Evelyn threw herself into work, determined to finish early.

The moment the clock struck five, she grabbed her things and strode out of the office.

At the exit, she nearly collided with Cassandra, who was also leaving. "Leaving so soon, Director Evelyn?"

Evelyn gave a curt nod. "I have plans."

Without another word, she headed for the elevators.

Cassandra hesitated, then hurried after her. "Going straight home?"

Evelyn pressed the elevator button and stepped inside. "Why?"

"No reason."

Cassandra flashed a smile and slipped in beside her, helpfully pressing the close-door button. "I was blind before. Who knew a world-class jewelry designer was right under my nose? Now that I know it's you, I have so much to learn."

Evelyn's brows knitted together. She ignored the flattery. "If you spent less time gossiping, you might actually be decent at your job."

Cassandra's smile faltered, but she stuck close as Evelyn exited the building. At first, Evelyn considered shooing her away, but eventually gave up. If Cassandra wanted to tail her, so be it.

Evelyn made a beeline for the supermarket near the office.

She hadn't seen the kids in days. Tonight, she'd cook them a feast.

The supermarket was packed.

"Director Evelyn, you cook too? That's amazing!"

"Having guests over tonight?"

"Director Evelyn—"

Cassandra's incessant chatter grated on her nerves. Evelyn swiftly grabbed two overflowing bags of groceries and headed for checkout.

The line was long.

A woman suddenly stepped forward, scrutinizing Evelyn. "Aren't you the woman from the news? The one who made that poor wife kneel?"

Evelyn tensed, ready to refute the accusation—

But Cassandra beat her to it.

"That's a lie! Director Evelyn isn't some homewrecker! Did you even watch the full report? That woman was delusional! If she couldn't keep her man in check, that's her problem!"

Her voice carried, drawing every shopper's attention.

On the surface, she was defending Evelyn. In reality, she'd just lit a fuse.

The supermarket crowd turned hostile in an instant.

Evelyn cursed under her breath—but it was too late.

The women closed in around them.

"It really is you!"

The first woman shoved her phone in Evelyn's face.

"You're that mistress!"

"Mistresses like you deserve to rot!"
###Chapter 304

"You shameless homewrecker! How dare you play the loving mother while grocery shopping?"

"Get out!"

The mob turned vicious, hurling insults and kicks. Rotten produce flew through the air toward her.

Evelyn raised her hands in defense. "I'm innocent!"

Her icy gaze locked onto Cassandra. "Director Montgomery, I'll take my leave. You... handle this mess yourself."

With that, Evelyn pushed through the angry crowd and escaped.

Now Cassandra stood alone against the raging tide.

Bending low, she shielded her groceries while fumbling for her phone to call the police.

Before she could dial, it rang.

Jostled violently, she struggled to maintain balance. Her trembling fingers accidentally answered.

"Where are you?" Daniel's calm voice came through as he stood outside Evelyn's Lakeside Residences with Liam and Emily.

The response was chaos - shoving bodies and venomous shouts.

"Homewreckers deserve death!"

"Destroying families should be a crime!"

"Pretty face, ugly soul!"

Daniel's expression darkened at the vile words.

His voice dropped to dangerous levels. "Location. Now."

Evelyn hesitated. "Metropolitan Supermarket on Barley Lane."

"Stay alive."

The call ended. Daniel punched the elevator button. "Evelyn's under attack at the supermarket."

Liam and Emily exchanged alarmed looks before following him into the descending elevator.

On the ground floor, Daniel scooped up Emily while Liam made urgent calls behind them.

The black Maserati's doors slammed shut. "Seatbelts," Daniel commanded.

Emily secured herself and checked Liam's buckle. "Ready!"

The sports car launched like a missile.

A fifteen-minute drive compressed into five terrifying minutes.

They arrived just as Tyler and Dominic sprinted up from the opposite direction, breathless.

The three men exchanged nods before charging upstairs.

Chaos reigned at checkout. Evelyn was trapped in a human cage.

Tyler and Dominic forced their way through while Daniel bulldozed toward the center, wrapping Evelyn in a protective embrace.

"Safe now," he murmured, crushing her trembling form against him.

"Who's this?"

"The cheating bastard protecting his whore?"

The insults resumed.

Daniel's head snapped up, eyes glacial. "Silence!"

His voice cracked like a whip. "One more word and I'll ruin your lives."

The supermarket plunged into stillness.

Several women opened their mouths, but were yanked back by wiser companions.

"That's Daniel Blackwood. CEO of Blackwood Enterprises."

The name alone struck them mute.

"You're okay." Daniel's brow furrowed as he examined Evelyn's disheveled state - torn clothes, wild hair. "Let's go."

Shielded by his body, they began moving toward the exit.

A bold woman suddenly blocked their path, arms spread. "Mr. Blackwood, openly protecting your mistress? Doesn't your wife deserve better?"
###Chapter 305

Evelyn's words plunged the supermarket into stunned silence. All eyes turned to Daniel.

His gaze sharpened like ice.

An arctic chill radiated from him, threatening to freeze the entire building.

After a tense pause, he scanned the crowd before locking eyes with the bold woman. "First, Evelyn isn't my mistress. She's an outstanding employee and a valued friend."

"Second," his voice turned steely, "my wife wouldn't entertain such ridiculous gossip. And I don't owe anyone explanations."

The woman stubbornly blocked their path. "But videos show Mrs. Blackwood accusing Evelyn first. You had a perfect husband image before she returned." She took a dramatic breath. "Unless... you're admitting your wife was right? That you're actually cheating?"

Daniel's expression darkened dangerously. "Are you lecturing me?"

She faltered under his glare. "Just sharing my opinion."

His laugh was razor-sharp. "Why would I care about your opinion?" He surveyed the gawking crowd. "You attack people based on rumors and expect me to listen? Who the hell do you think you are?"

Without warning, he scooped Evelyn into his arms.

Her hands flew to his neck instinctively before she jerked them away. "Daniel! Put me down!"

This was the worst possible moment for such intimacy. Was he trying to confirm their affair?

Ignoring her protests, Daniel smirked at the woman. "Isn't this what you wanted to see? Enjoy the show." He strode past her, his bodyguards Tyler and Dominic clearing their exit.

After three steps, he paused. "Tell Diana Hart next time to hire strangers I won't recognize." He'd seen this woman outside Silvercrest Manor.

Her face drained of color.

"Sir! Sorry I'm late!" Ethan rushed in, wiping sweat from his brow. He'd come straight from the office after Daniel's call.

"Handle the security footage and phone recordings," Daniel ordered coldly. "Then have them arrested for public disturbance."

Outside, Evelyn thrashed in his arms. "Have you lost your mind?"

His grip tightened. "Stop struggling."

She glared fiercely. "You're making everything worse!"

Daniel quickened his pace, finally dumping her unceremoniously into the backseat of his car.
###Chapter 306

"Mommy!"

The moment Evelyn stepped into the car, Emily flung herself into her arms. "Are you okay?"

Liam, ever the careful one, was busy arranging the grocery bags properly before checking Evelyn for any injuries.

Daniel's cold voice cut through the tension from the driver's seat as he started the engine. "That woman was Diana's friend."

Evelyn stiffened.

Before Daniel arrived, that woman had been the ringleader, the one who orchestrated the attack. The scratches on Evelyn's face? Her handiwork.

Daniel claimed she was Diana's friend, but her accent was pure Willowbrook. Local.

Diana? Diana wasn't from Willowbrook. She'd never even set foot in the city before.

Friends? Unlikely. More like employer and hired thug.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

First, Diana framed her for ruining Theodore's artwork. Then she weaponized the internet, leaking the surveillance footage herself. The dramatic office scene—the wife on her knees, begging the "mistress" for mercy.

Using Richard and Victoria to force her into that press conference, making her confess to breaking up a family. And now? Hiring locals to ambush her in a supermarket.

Diana wasn't just playing dirty—she was playing to destroy.

Evelyn pulled out her phone and texted Theodore.

[I'll be at the press conference tomorrow.]

Before, she'd thought it unnecessary. Now?

Now she wanted Diana to taste the humiliation she'd endured tonight—multiplied a hundredfold.

Theodore replied instantly. [Already prepping. Do you know someone named Oliver?]

Evelyn paused.

[Why?]

[After leaving your office today, an online contact named Oliver reached out. He has intel on tomorrow's conference—way more detailed than mine. Assuming he's with you?]

Warmth spread through Evelyn's chest. She typed back, [Not with me. Family.]

Theodore sent a grinning emoji. [Perfect. If he's trustworthy, we'll coordinate. You home yet?]

Evelyn's gaze flicked to Daniel in the driver's seat.

[Later.]

By the time she sent it, they'd reached Lakeside Residences.

"Mommy! Let's go!" Emily tugged her sleeve, then peeked at her phone. "Who's Theodore Allen?"

Daniel froze mid-step.

His voice was ice when he turned. "No wonder you've been glued to your phone."

Evelyn slipped her phone away with a light laugh. "Just catching up."

The look he gave her could've frozen hell over.

"Is Theodore Allen your new boyfriend?" Emily bounced, dragging Evelyn toward the building. "Is he cute? Do you like him?"
###Chapter 307

Daniel watched Evelyn and Sophia walk away, his lips pressed into a tight line. His gaze darkened, icy and unreadable.

"Mr. Blackwood."

Liam, standing behind him, shoved a grocery bag into Daniel's hands before flashing a deliberately bright smile. "What a happy coincidence! You've got Diana, the gorgeous lady, while my mom has the handsome Theodore. Both of you are so lucky in love!"

Daniel's expression turned stormy.

He shot Liam a frigid glare before stalking off, groceries in hand, his displeasure radiating.

Leaning against the car, Liam smirked as he watched Daniel's retreating figure.

Suffer, you scumbag.

"Mom, where's the first aid kit?"

The moment they stepped inside, Sophia began tearing through the house, searching frantically.

"I'm not hurt," Evelyn sighed, peeling off her torn jacket before heading to the bathroom to wash her face. She forced a smile. "I'll make you something delicious tonight."

Sophia ignored her, stubbornly digging through the living room.

Finally, she unearthed the first aid kit from behind the sofa.

"Mom!" She plopped it onto the coffee table and yanked Evelyn down, determined to treat her injuries.

Daniel and Liam walked in just as Sophia was carefully dabbing antiseptic on Evelyn's wounds.

Her long lashes fluttered like delicate butterfly wings.

Daniel studied Sophia, then flicked his gaze to Evelyn.

A strange realization struck him—Sophia's eyes, the way she blinked, were eerily similar to Evelyn's.

"Ow!"

Sophia pressed too hard, making Evelyn wince.

"Sorry, Mom!" Sophia bit her lip, instantly pulling back.

"Let me." Daniel stepped forward, taking the cotton swab from her. "Evelyn bought fruit for you two. Go wash them with Liam."

Sophia hesitated before grabbing Liam's hand. "Come on, let's go!"

Liam frowned, lowering his voice. "Since when are you so bad at dressing wounds? Did you mess up on purpose?"

Sophia flushed, avoiding his eyes. "Let's just eat the fruit!"

Rolling his eyes, Liam glanced back at the adults in the living room before sighing.

When will she understand Daniel isn't worth it?

"Until you clear your name, stay away from crowded places."

Daniel worked on Evelyn's injuries, his expression grim. "You stand out too much."

She was stunning—her face too perfect, too striking. Even in a crowd, she drew attention effortlessly.

Sometimes, Daniel wondered if her beauty was natural or engineered.

She was almost too flawless.

Though her aura was similar, Evelyn now was far more captivating than the Evelyn Carter from six years ago.

The thought of that Evelyn made his chest tighten.

Diana might be the same person, but everything about her had changed—her presence, her essence.

"I'm clearing my name tomorrow." Evelyn's voice snapped him back.

His hands stilled. "How?"

"Joseph and Victoria Sinclair came to see me today."

Daniel's grip on the cotton swab tightened. "What did they want?"
###Chapter 308

"Obviously, it's all about their precious daughter."

Evelyn's lips curved into a wry smile. "They've generously offered to host a press conference to 'clarify' today's events on my behalf."

Her gaze shifted to Daniel. "But here's the catch." She tilted her head. "They want me to publicly confess that I seduced you and had an affair. Oh, and take responsibility for leaking that surveillance footage that exposed Diana's bullying."

Daniel's brow furrowed as he continued dabbing antiseptic on her scrapes. "Ridiculous."

Whether Evelyn had done those things or not was irrelevant. She owed Diana nothing.

Were they delusional? Did they actually think she'd agree to this?

"I'm going." Evelyn met Daniel's eyes squarely. "If they want me there, I'll show up."

Her voice hardened. "But I'll be setting the record straight."

Daniel paused, cotton swab hovering mid-air. "About what?"

"That I never seduced you. That I didn't leak that footage." She adjusted her position on the couch. "And I'll be sharing exactly what Mrs. Blackwood has put me through."

Her chin lifted in challenge. "Going to stop me, Mr. Blackwood?"

Even if he tried, she wouldn't back down.

"Hold still." His grip tightened on her wrist as he resumed treating her wounds. "I'm staying out of whatever's between you two."

If this taught Diana that he wouldn't always clean up her messes, all the better.

Evelyn studied his impassive face. "No arguments? No attempts to change my mind?"

Daniel didn't look up. "Would it make any difference?"

She fell silent. He was right. Nothing would deter her from this.

After everything Diana had done, mercy wasn't an option. Still, she hadn't expected Daniel's indifference.

Then again, it tracked. The man had faked devotion to her once with equal coldness. Why would Diana be any exception?

With sudden clarity, she pulled her arm free.

Daniel blinked at the empty space where her wrist had been, antiseptic bottle still in hand.

"I'm not made of glass." Evelyn stood abruptly, heading for the kitchen.

Inside, Liam and Sophia were a comical sight - one crouched sorting vegetables, the other precariously balanced on a stool washing greens.

The scene tugged at Evelyn's heart.

She scooped Sophia off the stool. "Let me handle this."

Sophia blinked up at her, wet vegetables dripping onto the floor. After a beat, she stretched on tiptoes to return them to the colander.

"Mommy," she whispered, "why aren't you talking with Daddy more?"

All that effort to get them alone...

Evelyn ruffled her hair. "Nothing left to say."

Taking the vegetables from Liam, she shooed them out. "I've got this. Go play."

Sophia's protest died as Liam dragged her away.

In the living room, Daniel was scrolling through Ethan's messages when Liam approached.

"Mr. Blackwood." The boy took a deep breath. "Did you and Ms. Diana break up?"

Daniel's head snapped up. "Who told you that?"

"The staff at home." Liam bit his lip. "Ms. Diana's been... upset. She hit Isabelle yesterday." His wide eyes searched Daniel's face. "Why did you leave her? Don't you love her anymore?"
###Chapter 309

Daniel Blackwood tilted his chin downward. His piercing gaze locked onto Liam Carter's face, which barely covered his palm. "What kind of response were you hoping to get by asking me that?"

The intensity in Daniel's stare felt like a physical threat.

Even as a self-proclaimed jerk, Liam had to admit those dark eyes seemed capable of seeing straight through a person's soul.

He quickly averted his gaze, unable to maintain eye contact. "Just making conversation."

"If it's just conversation, then here's my casual reply."

Daniel shifted into a more relaxed position on the sofa, his lips curling into a humorless smile. "I still love her."

He closed his eyes, voice flat. "I'm still in love with who she used to be."

Liam's eyes widened. The old version of her? That would be his mother, Evelyn Carter! He spun around to face Daniel properly. "What about who she is now?"

The present version?

Daniel adjusted his posture again, eyes remaining shut. Silence stretched between them.

Some questions even he didn't have clear answers for.

Part of him believed his feelings shouldn't change so quickly—not after six years of loving and waiting for her.

Yet another part couldn't reconcile how the woman he'd adored had transformed into everything he despised.

Did he still love her? He honestly didn't know.

When Evelyn had asked earlier whether he'd stop her from exposing Diana's crimes at the press conference, he'd been equally speechless.

Noticing Daniel's prolonged silence, Liam pursed his lips and rolled his eyes dramatically.

"Liam." Sophia Carter frowned, tugging her brother's sleeve. "Leave Daddy alone. He's not in the mood."

Then she flashed a mischievous wink. "I found something cool in Mommy's room. Come on!"

Liam cast one last glance at Daniel before letting Sophia drag him toward Evelyn's bedroom.

Hearing their retreating footsteps, Daniel exhaled a quiet, humorless chuckle.

Those two rascals called him Daddy while referring to Evelyn as Mommy.

Any outsider listening might assume he and Evelyn were actually together.

The thought made him turn toward the kitchen.

Through the glass door, he could see Evelyn moving about busily.

The sizzle of cooking oil blended with the children's laughter from the bedroom, creating a domestic symphony that left him momentarily dazed.

Compared to the sterile emptiness of Silvercrest Manor, this was exactly the family atmosphere he'd always craved.

Lively. Warm. Full of life. Just with the wrong woman at its center.

If the person bustling in that kitchen had been Diana Hart instead of Evelyn Carter, everything would have been perfect.

His musings were interrupted by the click of a stove being turned off.

Evelyn swiftly transferred food from pan to plate, balancing it one-handed while attempting to slide open the kitchen door with the other.

Her damp fingers kept slipping against the glass.

She tried adjusting her grip, but the door remained stubbornly shut.

Evelyn turned to set the plate down when the door suddenly opened from the outside.

Daniel wordlessly took the dish from her hands and carried it to the dining table.

Then he turned back to study Evelyn's startled expression. "Need help with anything else?"

Evelyn blinked before shaking her head. Daniel's brows knitted as he surveyed the kitchen.
###Chapter 310

A few dishes remained on the counter, untouched.

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts, turned, and stepped back into the kitchen. She carefully carried each dish out one by one.

Within moments, the small dining table was laden with food.

Four dishes and a soup—a proper feast.

Daniel stood frozen, watching the spread before him and Evelyn bustling to set the table. His chest tightened.

Back when they were still together, Evelyn Carter would cook like this for him almost every day, waiting patiently for his return.

Sometimes, she’d wait until midnight. When he finally came home, he’d find her either dozing at the table or curled up on the sofa.

At the time, he’d insisted he didn’t love her. But seeing her like that always stirred something deep inside him.

He’d carry her upstairs, have the housekeeper reheat the food, then eat alone at the table.

Simple dishes, but each one brimming with her devotion.

Six years later, Evelyn Carter had become Diana Hart. But the warmth she once carried was gone.

Since Diana’s return, she hadn’t cooked for him once—nothing like the Evelyn of the past.

Back then, Evelyn was gentle, obedient, longing for them to be like any ordinary, loving couple.

Now, Diana only cared about status. She’d learned to play the same manipulative games as the so-called elite women she emulated.

"Daddy, time to eat!"

Sophia’s voice yanked Daniel back to the present.

He blinked.

Liam, Sophia, and Evelyn were already seated. Sophia and Evelyn sat on one side, Liam on the other.

Daniel forced a smile and took the seat beside Liam.

"This is the first time our family of four is eating together. Let’s celebrate!"

Sophia raised her small hands, pouring orange juice into everyone’s glasses. When she reached Daniel, she suddenly frowned. Hopping down from her chair, she marched to the drawer beneath Evelyn’s TV and pulled out a bottle of wine.

"Daddy, drink this!"

Daniel shook his head. "I have to drive later."

Sophia pouted. "Uncle Ethan can drive."

Then, with surprising skill, she popped the cork open.

Daniel’s brows knitted. "How do you know how to do that?"

Pouring the wine, Sophia grinned. "Godfather taught me. He loves wine, and I love watching him drink, so I learned!"

This was the first time Daniel had heard her mention a godfather.

He vaguely recalled Evelyn’s best friend, Grace, was their godmother.

So he accepted the wine with a faint smile. "Why are you the one keeping your godfather company? Where’s your godmother?"

Sophia hesitated. "Godfather and godmother don’t know each other. Godfather is godfather. Godmother is someone else."

Liam shot Daniel a cold look. "Just like how Daddy and Mommy aren’t necessarily a family, godfather and godmother don’t have to know each other either."

He took a sip of his juice. "Our godfather is Nathan Pierce. I’m sure you know who that is, Mr. Blackwood."

Daniel’s grip on the wineglass faltered.

Nathan Pierce.

The man who’d been his biggest business rival. The one he’d once suspected of planting Evelyn as a spy.

His expression darkened. "How did he become your godfather?"

Liam shrugged. "Because we’re close. You might not know this, Mr. Blackwood, but the woman sitting right here—Ms. Evelyn—was almost a Mrs. Pierce."
###Chapter 311

Daniel paused, the wine glass frozen in his hand.

He hadn't expected Evelyn and Nathan to have that kind of history.

His gaze lifted, dark and unreadable. "Quite the social butterfly, aren't you, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood."

She didn't deny it. That only irritated him more.

Nathan Pierce pining for her overseas, Theodore Allen right next door—

The thought made his grip tighten around the glass. He drained it in one swift motion.

Liam blinked, startled by the speed. Before he could refill it, Daniel snatched the bottle and drank straight from it.

Evelyn and the children stared as he finished the entire thing.

Thud.

The empty bottle hit the table. "More."

Liam and Sophia exchanged glances. "There is!"

"I'll get it!" Liam scrambled off his chair, returning with two fresh bottles.

Evelyn shot him a warning look. "Enough."

"But Mr. Blackwood wants to drink!"

He popped the corks and slid them toward Daniel. "Here you go."

He was curious—what did a drunk Daniel Blackwood look like?

Daniel didn't hesitate. Maybe it was the frustration of the day, the suffocating realization that the woman he'd loved had become everything he despised.

Six years of waiting, only for Diana Hart to return instead of Evelyn. He'd even prepared divorce papers.

It felt like ice water had been dumped over his heart.

Maybe he was too cruel. Maybe she'd changed too much.

Either way, nothing was as it should be.

Bottle after bottle. By the third, Daniel slumped back in his chair, his voice rough. "More."

"There is—" Liam started, but Evelyn cut him off.

"Do you want to land him in the ER?"

Daniel's stomach issues had already hospitalized him once.

Liam hesitated, then sat back down.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Finally, she stood and hauled Daniel toward her bedroom.

The sofa would've been more appropriate—he didn't deserve her bed. But drunk men were unpredictable, and she wasn't risking him stumbling into danger.

What she didn't expect was his grip tightening the moment she laid him down.

In one swift motion, he flipped her beneath him.

The door clicked shut—small fingers at work.

Before she could react, his lips crashed onto hers, the taste of wine sharp on his tongue.

She couldn't breathe.

When he finally pulled back, his eyes were glazed. "Almost Mrs. Pierce, huh?" His voice was low, bitter. "Where did we go wrong?"

Evelyn shoved at his chest, but he didn't budge.

His mouth found hers again, relentless.

Somewhere in the haze, his voice rumbled against her skin.
###Chapter 312

"You're too kind. I nearly..." His words trailed off into silence.

Evelyn met Daniel's intoxicated gaze as he let out a low chuckle. His arms tightened around her. "Let's sleep."

It became a night of reckless passion.

Morning light pierced through the curtains when Evelyn's phone shattered the silence.

Victoria Sinclair's agitated voice crackled through the receiver. "Ms. Carter! The press conference venue at Metropolitan Arena is ready. Nine sharp. You gave me your word."

Evelyn massaged her throbbing temples. "I remember."

"Don't you dare stand me up!" Victoria's tone turned sharp. "I have the recording of your conversation with Theodore yesterday. Skip this, and I'll release it to every media outlet!"

Evelyn's grip on the phone faltered.

Ice flooded her veins. "You recorded us?"

"Naturally." Victoria's breath hitched. "Trust must be earned. This guarantees your cooperation."

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. The bitter irony choked her - her own mother resorting to covert recordings. All for Serena's sake. All for Diana's inheritance.

After a weighted pause, Evelyn forced a laugh. "Relax, Victoria. I'll be there."

She ended the call before hearing another word.

The phone clattered against the nightstand. Evelyn stretched languidly, her limbs heavy with exhaustion.

Her fingertips brushed against warm skin.

Daniel's hand closed around her wrist.

Evelyn's eyes flew open to find him propped on one elbow, watching her with unnerving calmness. Last night's memories crashed over her in a heated wave.

She wrenched her arm free. "Why are you still here?"

Daniel reclined against the headboard, the sheet pooling at his waist. "Where else would I be?"

Evelyn snatched her robe from the floor. "You got what you wanted. Isn't that enough?"

His expression darkened at her dismissive tone.

"Are you seriously attending that circus today?"

Evelyn tied the robe with sharp movements. "Heard the threat, didn't you? That recording makes Theo and me look like backstabbers if I bail."

She shot him a scathing look. "Planning to stop me, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel's lips curved as he reached for her bedside photo album. "Hardly." The pages whispered as he flipped through them. "Just need the schedule so I can make myself scarce."
###Chapter 313

Evelyn shot Daniel a withering glare as she snatched the photo album from his hands, slamming it back onto her nightstand. "It's nine in the morning, Mr. Blackwood. You're welcome to hide from your problems, but not in my apartment."

She marched to the door and swung it open. "Out."

Daniel's brow arched. "Are you kicking me out?"

"Was I not clear enough?" she retorted with a scoff.

He studied her for a long moment before grabbing his discarded shirt and shrugging it on. As he passed her in the doorway, he paused. "You're downright ruthless after getting dressed."

Evelyn blinked in shock. By the time she recovered, Daniel was already splashing water in the bathroom. She shot daggers at his back before storming into the adjacent bedroom.

The two-bedroom apartment had been prepared for Liam and Sophia's visit. She'd made up the guest room, though she hadn't checked on them last night after... distractions.

The neatly made beds showed clear signs of use. On Liam's miniature desk sat a note in childish scrawl:

Mommy,
We went to school so you could sleep! Made breakfast for you in the kitchen. Break a leg at your press conference today!

Two oversized smiley faces punctuated the message, warming Evelyn's chest.

She was halfway to the kitchen when she froze. Daniel sat at her dining table, shamelessly devouring the breakfast her children had left for her.

"Those were meant for me," she hissed.

Daniel merely pushed a plate toward her. The doorbell chimed before she could protest.

Theodore's voice floated through the wood. "Evelyn? Are you awake?"

She hesitated only a second. "I'm up."

"I waited last night, but figured you needed rest. Come over when you're ready - we should discuss today's press conference."

"Be there shortly," she called back. Turning, she collided with Daniel's solid chest.

He'd materialized from the dining area, now fully dressed in his signature tailored suit. Evelyn stumbled back. "What are you—"

"Leaving," he murmured, crowding her against the door. His breath tickled her ear as he whispered, "Isn't this what you wanted, Ms. Carter?"

Outside, Theodore's phone rang. Evelyn's blood turned to ice when she heard him say "Oliver" clearly through the thin door.

Daniel's fingers closed around the knob. Evelyn saw the dangerous glint in his eyes - he'd heard the name too.

Her hands flew to his wrist. "Please don't," she begged, eyes wide with panic.

If Daniel connected Oliver to Liam... If he realized there were twins...

And Theodore could never see them like this.

The knob turned beneath her trembling fingers.
###Chapter 314

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her gaze locked intensely on Daniel's face. "I'm begging you. Don't open that door."

At this moment, she had no other options left.

To Daniel, her plea was nothing short of humiliating. Did she care so much about Theodore? Was she terrified of him finding out about them? Did she really think she could hide this from him?

The more she resisted, the more determined he became to make Theodore understand—she belonged to him.

With that thought, Daniel flung the door open without hesitation.

A gust of cold air from the hallway rushed in, sharp against Evelyn's skin. She should have known better than to expect mercy from a man like Daniel.

Fortunately, Theodore had already ended his call.

"Ev—"

He looked up, about to call her name, when his eyes landed on the imposing figure standing in the doorway.

Theodore froze for a fraction of a second before a slow, knowing smile curved his lips. "Mr. Blackwood, are you homeless now?"

Daniel returned the smile, though it didn't reach his eyes. "My home is wherever I choose it to be."

"Does Mrs. Blackwood know about this?" Theodore arched a brow, his gaze flickering past Daniel to where Evelyn stood rigidly, her back turned. "Evelyn, go pack your things. I'll have a little chat with Mr. Blackwood while I wait."

Evelyn's face was ghostly pale. She bit down hard on her lower lip. "Fine."

Without another word, she strode to the bathroom and slammed the door shut behind her.

Daniel crossed his arms, his smirk turning bitter. "She really does whatever you say."

"Of course." Theodore met his gaze head-on, unflinching. "Because I respect her. I wouldn't chase after her while still tied to someone else. I'd never put her in a position where she's labeled a mistress. And if rumors started, I wouldn't just stand by—I certainly wouldn't parade her around like some prize to flaunt in front of other men, completely disregarding how she feels."

He tilted his head, his expression mocking. "I can do all that, Mr. Blackwood. Can you?"

Daniel's expression darkened at the verbal blow. Seeing the storm brewing in his eyes, Theodore couldn't help but laugh.

"Here's something you should understand, Mr. Blackwood. Getting into a woman's bed means nothing. The real challenge is getting into her heart."

Daniel scoffed. "And you think you can?"

"Maybe not yet," Theodore admitted smoothly. "But at least I have the right to try. As someone else's husband, you don't even have that privilege."

With that, he stepped forward, forcing Daniel back, and slammed the door in his face.

Daniel stood rooted in place, staring at the closed door. His hands clenched into fists at his sides.

Just then, his phone rang.

Diana.

He exhaled sharply before answering. "What is it?"

"Daniel." Her voice was soft, almost sweet. "I just realized we never got anything for Grandmother Eleanor's birthday. I invited her shopping, but she insisted you come along. It's been so long since we've gone out together—or seen her. We're at the mall now. Can you join us?"

Daniel hesitated, then relented. "Fine."

"Perfect!"

On the other end, Diana let out a quiet breath of relief before hanging up, satisfaction curling through her.

Victoria was holding a press conference for Evelyn today. At nine sharp, it would broadcast live on the massive screens downtown.

By then, she would have Daniel and Grandmother Eleanor right there to witness it.

She wanted Daniel to apologize to her—publicly, in front of everyone. Especially his grandmother.
###Chapter 315

9:03 AM.
The Metropolitan Arena buzzed with anticipation.

Evelyn Carter arrived with Theodore Allen in tow. Reporters had already positioned their cameras toward the main stage, lenses gleaming under the harsh lights.

Victoria Sinclair spotted her instantly. A calculated smile curved her lips. "Ms. Evelyn. I knew you'd show up."

She produced a recorder from her coat pocket. "I was prepared to release this if you'd refused."

With deliberate slowness, she extended the device. "But since you're here..." Her fingers released it. "It's useless now."

Evelyn caught it mid-air. Her expression didn't flicker as she dropped it into a nearby trash bin.

She checked her watch. "We're starting."

Victoria's smile stiffened. She signaled the host with a sharp nod.

The woman at the podium adjusted her microphone. Her voice rang clear—too familiar.

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Vanessa Prescott met her gaze with a smirk. "Hello again, Evelyn Carter. Fancy seeing you here."

Recognition flared. This was the same woman who'd ambushed her outside the grocery store. Now she stood as the press conference's host, bold as brass.

Evelyn's jaw tightened.

Vanessa didn't wait for acknowledgment. She addressed the crowd with practiced ease. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Evelyn Carter's statement regarding the viral allegations against Diana Hart—wife of Daniel Blackwood."

At Willowbrook Mall's central screen, Eleanor Blackwood froze mid-step. Her cane clattered against marble.

"Daniel!" Her voice cut through the shopping crowd. "Explain this!"

Daniel's gaze remained fixed on the broadcast. His posture betrayed nothing.

Diana clutched Eleanor's arm. "Grandmother, please don't upset yourself." Her lashes fluttered. "Evelyn must feel... wronged after yesterday. I already apologized on my knees, but—"

A tear slipped free.

Eleanor's grip on her cane turned white-knuckled. "You groveled, and she still does this?" She rounded on Daniel. "Your mistress humiliates your wife publicly! Will you still defend her?"

Daniel's eyes narrowed at Diana's bowed head. At her trembling hands.

Eleanor thumped onto a bench, glowering at the screen. "Let's hear what poison this harlot spews about our family next."

Between them, Daniel's lips curved without humor. The game was in motion.
###Chapter 316

So that explained everything.

No wonder Victoria had pressured Evelyn to hold the press conference that day. No wonder Diana had deliberately taken Eleanor out shopping.

Diana had orchestrated it all.

She had anticipated Evelyn wouldn’t clear her name during the press conference, so she’d arranged for Eleanor to be there.

The press conference was just a facade. Diana’s real goal was to force Daniel to publicly sever ties with Evelyn in front of Eleanor.

How calculated.

In the past, seeing Evelyn Carter cry would have shattered his heart.

Now, watching Diana’s tears, he only felt the urge to laugh coldly.

Daniel turned and took a seat beside Eleanor. "Perfect. I’d love to see how this plays out."

Then he arched a brow, his icy gaze locking onto Diana. "Sit."

Diana bit her lip and hesitantly sat beside him.

"Daniel," she whispered, dabbing at her eyes. "I never meant for things to escalate like this. I only wanted to apologize to Evelyn today—"

Daniel leaned back against the bench, his voice flat. "The host is your friend, isn’t she?"

Diana stiffened. Her eyes flicked to Vanessa on the massive screen. "We... know each other, but this must just be her job—"

Inside, she cursed. That idiot Mr. Prescott! How could he have let Vanessa host this? It practically screamed Diana’s involvement to Daniel!

"You’re more than acquaintances." Daniel turned, his cold stare piercing her. "She led the attack last night. Cornered Evelyn in the supermarket. Scratched her face. Ripped her clothes."

Diana trembled violently. "I... I didn’t know."

She truly hadn’t. After finalizing her plans the night before, she’d sent Mr. Prescott to check on Daniel and the children.

Once she confirmed they were at his office, she’d gone to bed.

She had no idea what Vanessa had done to Evelyn.

But...

Diana turned to Daniel, confusion flickering in her eyes. "Daniel, how did you know about that? Last night, you were—"

Hadn’t he been working late at the office?

Daniel’s gaze darkened. "If you can have someone spy on me, why can’t I have someone put on a performance?"

Her face paled.

He smirked. "The children and I weren’t at the office last night."

Diana’s fists clenched. He hadn’t said where they’d been, but the implication was clear.

"Everyone."

On the screen, Evelyn smiled. "Regarding the rumors circulating online, I must admit—some of them are true."

She faced the stunned reporters. "I did have ulterior motives toward Mr. Blackwood."

The room erupted.
###Chapter 317

Evelyn's bold declaration on the massive screen made Diana and Eleanor Blackwood simultaneously tense up.
This was supposed to be a press conference to clear Evelyn's name. So why… was she admitting it outright?

Eleanor shot Diana a sharp look. Diana immediately lowered her gaze, fingers twisting together nervously.

The press venue erupted into chaos.

Reporters fired questions like bullets.

"Ms. Carter, what exactly do you mean by having 'intentions' toward Mr. Blackwood?"

"Are you confessing to seducing him? Is this your way of admitting you're the other woman?"

"How can you openly declare yourself a mistress? Do you have no shame?"

Evelyn, standing calmly at the center of the storm, merely smiled. "When did I say I was a mistress? Can't a woman simply admire Daniel for his wealth?"

The room fell silent.

She chuckled. "The internet claims I stayed at Blackwood Group to seduce Mr. Blackwood. But let me ask—why would I want a man who's been with countless women?"

Her question struck like a thunderclap. Not a single sound followed.

In the mall, Daniel stared at the screen, his expression darkening.

Evelyn continued, projecting an analysis chart onto the display.

"Three days ago, Mrs. Blackwood pushed me at the art gallery, claiming jealousy over late nights with her husband. But let's examine what I was doing before that incident."

She took a breath and revealed her schedule.

"Days before the gallery, I was actually in jail due to personal matters. After my release, I stayed at a friend's place."

Surveillance footage played next. "This is my friend's staircase. Only three people appear in this video—me, her, and her boyfriend. Mr. Blackwood never set foot there."

Evelyn locked eyes with the camera. "First, Daniel couldn't have secretly visited me in jail. Second, he doesn't possess superhuman abilities to evade surveillance. So why would Mrs. Blackwood use 'working late' as justification to assault me?"

Her logic was flawless. Reporters sat stunned.

If Evelyn had no prior inappropriate contact with Daniel, Diana's "jealousy" motive collapsed entirely.

Evelyn was no mistress.

Whispers broke out across the venue.

At the mall, Eleanor turned to Diana, voice icy. "Explain this."

Diana bit her lip hard.

When she'd pushed Evelyn that day, she hadn't considered the timeline. She'd seized the mistress narrative out of convenience. Now, faced with Evelyn's airtight evidence, she had no defense.

Her nails dug into her palms. "This proves nothing."
###Chapter 318

A sharp feminine voice cut through the tension.

Vanessa Prescott scoffed and rose from her seat. "Who declared your dalliances with Daniel Blackwood were limited to nighttime?"

Noticing her haughty demeanor, Theodore Allen arched an eyebrow with amusement. "Diana made that claim."

"Perhaps she was merely offering you an alibi." Vanessa's lips curled. "After all, a CEO entangled with his subordinate hardly paints a flattering picture."

She sighed dramatically. "Ms. Evelyn, if you and Mr. Blackwood were truly innocent, why would Mrs. Blackwood single you out among all women?"

"Exactly!" Victoria Sinclair seized the moment, nodding vigorously. "My daughter has always been compassionate, dutiful, and nurturing. She wouldn't fabricate accusations."

Suddenly animated, Victoria stood. "Six years ago when Diana was with Daniel, he worked alongside countless women. Never once did she cast baseless suspicions. Why target you now? The fault lies with you."

Evelyn remained motionless, absorbing Victoria's venomous words. A bitter taste filled her mouth.

Her past trust in Daniel had become the very weapon now used to vilify her.

The injustices she endured were now twisted into proof of another woman's virtue.

The irony was almost laughable.

"Ms. Carter."

A reporter stood abruptly. "While you've disproved overnight encounters, can you verify you've never met Mr. Blackwood privately?"

Another chimed in, "The rumors about your brief reconciliation—were they entirely unfounded?"

"Did you knowingly pursue an attached man?"

"Why persist in denying your role as the other woman?"

The questions grew increasingly invasive.

Evelyn's knuckles whitened against the table's edge. Scanning the ravenous crowd, her lips twisted into a defiant smirk.

Truth held no value here—only sensational headlines mattered.

Demanding she account for every interaction with Daniel was nothing short of persecution.

"Enough."

Theodore positioned himself as a shield before Evelyn. "If Mrs. Blackwood alleges impropriety, the burden of proof rests with her. Harassing Evelyn for evidence is outright intimidation."

"Intimidation?" Vanessa's laugh dripped with mockery. "Didn't Evelyn convene this conference to clear her name? If she can't provide exculpatory evidence, we're entitled to draw our own conclusions. Where's the coercion in that?"

On the massive screen, Daniel's gaze burned into Evelyn's figure behind Theodore. His fingers twitched toward his phone.

A delicate hand restrained him.

Diana's lips trembled. "Daniel, you'd defend her? Without Vanessa's intervention, I'd be the one crucified by the media."

Her nails dug into his wrist. "She brought this upon herself. Don't—"

He wrenched free, voice glacial. "Should I let them brand me as the philanderer who seduced Evelyn?"

Diana's eyes dropped to the lipstick smudge beneath his collar. Her smile turned venomous. "Aren't you?"
###Chapter 319

Diana's words struck Daniel silent. He had no rebuttal.

The truth was undeniable. Before Evelyn returned, he'd felt something different for Diana compared to other women.

But when he realized Evelyn wasn't the same person she'd been six years ago, his feelings for Diana had deepened. So much so that in a moment of drunken recklessness, he'd—

Daniel's silence only sharpened the venom in Evelyn's glare. She bit her lip hard.

"Daniel, have you forgotten?" Her voice trembled. "Before I came back, what did you promise the world? You said you'd do anything if I returned. That no matter when, I'd always be the most important person to you."

She wiped at her tears, shoulders shaking. "Tell me, Daniel. Have you forgotten your own words?"

Watching her cry, guilt twisted in his chest.

But frustration burned hotter.

Six years. How had they ended up like this?

"Enough of this nonsense!" Eleanor Blackwood slammed her cane against the floor. "Daniel, Evelyn is your wife! How dare you treat her this way?"

She snatched his phone from his grasp. "Let me make one thing clear—Diana deserved every word of criticism today! She's been scheming against you from the start! First with that incident, and now, with Evelyn back? She should've known her place! If she refuses to learn, then she has no right to complain about what people say!" Her grip tightened. "You will not defend her. Understood?"

"Grandmother, please don't upset yourself." Evelyn dabbed at her eyes, clinging to Eleanor's arm. "Your health comes first. After the press conference, I'll issue a statement on Daniel's behalf. We'll make it clear that Diana was the one who—"

"Exactly!" Eleanor scoffed. "And we're firing her! Talent means nothing when she's this kind of woman. The Blackwood Group doesn't need her!" She patted Evelyn's hand. "Besides, jewelry design isn't some impossible skill. You've been studying it too, haven't you? If Diana could be Design Director, so can you!"

"Grandmother..."

Listening to them, Daniel's frown deepened.

His gaze locked onto his phone in Eleanor's grip. "Give it back."

She glared. "Not until after the press conference. I won't risk you interfering for that woman!"

Daniel clenched his jaw. The mall was crowded—making a scene wasn't an option.

Evelyn studied his stormy expression. She reached for his hand. "Daniel, don't worry."

Her eyes flicked to the massive screen broadcasting the conference. "It'll be over soon, won't it?"

Daniel yanked his hand away.

On the screen, Diana's face was pale. The sight of it felt like a vise around his heart.

This wasn't right. Diana didn't deserve this. From the beginning, she'd been dragged into a mess that wasn't hers.

After a long moment, Daniel drew a sharp breath—and stood.

Evelyn startled, then realization dawned. She grabbed his arm. "Daniel, no! If you go now, you'll never be able to deny your relationship with her!"

Eleanor struck her cane against the floor. "Sit down! After this, we're announcing that you and Evelyn are reconciling. What do you think you're doing?"

Daniel slowly pried Evelyn's fingers from his sleeve.

His voice turned icy. "Reconciling? You and me?"

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Yesterday, I told you I needed time to decide whether we stay married—or end this for good."
###Chapter 320

"That settles it."

Daniel strode toward Eleanor Blackwood and snatched his phone back. His voice was ice-cold. "No matter how much I care for someone, I won't let them manipulate the truth or hurt an innocent woman."

His gaze flicked to Diana, sharp and dismissive. "Besides, I don’t think I care that much anymore."

With that, he turned on his heel and left.

Diana clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms. She wanted to run after him, but Eleanor hurled her cane to the ground with a clatter. "That ungrateful boy! How dare he defy me like this?"

Swallowing her frustration, Diana forced herself to turn back. "Grandmother, please don’t upset yourself—"

Daniel didn’t look back.

He drove straight to the Metropolitan Arena, where the press conference was still in full swing.

Reporters hurled one vicious question after another at Evelyn, their voices overlapping in a relentless assault.

Then—

"Excuse me."

A child’s voice cut through the noise, amplified by the speakers.

The room fell silent. Heads turned, confused. Why was there a child speaking at a press conference?

Oliver’s face appeared on the screen, pale but determined. The hospital room behind him was dim, the sky outside already dark. "I’ve heard all your questions. But before Evelyn answers any of them, I’d like you to listen to this."

A click. Then—

"I know they’re innocent, but I need Luna gone."

Diana’s voice, crisp and venomous, filled the room.

"Mr. Prescott, post that video Theo gave me. Route it through Evelyn’s IP. Make it look like she leaked it."

"Hire the international troll farms too. Flood the networks with rumors. Point everything at her."

"Mr. Prescott, help Vanessa set up the press conference. Pay off reporters to attack Evelyn."

"This time, I’ll make sure she never survives in Willowbrook."

"Once she’s out of the way, I’ll deal with those two brats."

Silence.

Absolute, suffocating silence.

Oliver’s voice was calm. "In case anyone doubts whose voice this is—"

He played the viral clip of Diana kneeling before Evelyn, her tearful plea echoing through the speakers.

"Please forgive me. What happened that day… I was wrong."

Identical. No expert analysis needed.

The room stayed frozen.

Finally, a reporter cleared his throat. "So… this entire scandal was orchestrated by Mrs. Blackwood?"

No one answered.

Onstage, Vanessa’s face had gone rigid.

How?

How had they gotten that recording?

She forced a tight smile. "This—this has to be fabricated. Why would Diana ever be jealous of Evelyn? She and Daniel are—"

"Are we?"

A deep voice cut her off.

All heads swiveled toward the entrance.

Daniel stood there, his expression unreadable. The crowd parted instinctively as he walked forward.

"Diana and I were a perfect couple," he said, his voice quiet but carrying. "Past tense."
###Chapter 321

Daniel Blackwood's sudden appearance sent shockwaves through the room. Reporters gasped. On stage, Evelyn Carter and Theodore Allen exchanged stunned glances.

"Did you arrange this?" Evelyn whispered through clenched teeth.

Theodore raised his hands in surrender. "I swear on my life, it wasn't me."

Before they could continue, Daniel had already reached Evelyn's side. He picked up her microphone with deliberate calm.

"If everyone's so eager to accuse Evelyn and me of having an affair," his voice cut through the room like winter wind, "how could I possibly miss this party?"

Daniel took the seat beside Evelyn with regal grace. His piercing gaze swept over the reporters like a king surveying his court. "Direct all your questions to me. Leave Evelyn out of this."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees. Reporters who'd been shouting accusations moments ago fell silent. Several tried to slip away, only to find Ethan Reynolds, Tyler Walsh, and Dominic Shaw blocking the exits.

The silence stretched unbearably long.

When no one spoke, Daniel's lips curved into a humorless smile. "Allow me to clarify then."

He leaned forward slightly. "Evelyn is an extraordinary jewelry designer. My children adore her. Our relationship is strictly professional - employer and employee, with mutual respect. Though," he added with deliberate provocation, "if I were to divorce, who knows what might develop?"

His expression hardened instantly. "But make no mistake - Evelyn Carter is not, and never has been, my mistress."

The room held its breath.

Vanessa Prescott finally snapped. She shot to her feet, face flushed with outrage. "Daniel Blackwood! How dare you humiliate Diana like this? After everything she's sacrificed for you? All the years she's waited? And now you publicly defend your whore?"

Daniel's glare could have frozen lava. "I said she's not my mistress." Each word carried lethal precision.

Vanessa's lips twisted. "By coming here, you're admitting the recording was real. That Diana tried to harm Evelyn. What kind of husband publicly sides against his own wife?"

At the mention of the recording, Daniel's jaw tightened. He remembered every damning word. Especially Diana's chilling threat: "Only when I get rid of her can I focus on dealing with those two brats."

His blood ran cold. Liam and Emily were her own flesh and blood. Because they'd bonded with Evelyn, his wife wanted them... gone?

Daniel stood abruptly, his voice cutting through the tension. "Since you're all so invested in my personal life, let me make another announcement."

He took a measured breath. "I once said I'd do anything to have my wife back. Now that she's returned..." His voice turned hollow. "I've learned time can twist someone beyond recognition."

"Her face, her voice, even her mannerisms - they're all there. But the woman I loved is gone." His gaze focused on some distant point beyond the crowd. "The Evelyn Carter I married would trust me implicitly. Business dinners, meetings - she never doubted me. This version? Consumed by jealousy. Therefore..."

The room leaned forward as one.

"I'm filing for divorce."

The explosion of gasps nearly shook the walls. The message was clear: Daniel Blackwood would divorce his wife for trying to destroy Evelyn Carter.
###Chapter 322

The announcement hit like a thunderbolt.

Even the reporters were stunned into silence—Evelyn included.

The first to react was Victoria, who had been lurking in the shadows.

She lunged forward, fingers clawing at Daniel's collar. "How dare you divorce my daughter! After everything she sacrificed for you! You're throwing her away now?"

Daniel peeled her grip off, one finger at a time. "You said it yourself—sacrifices from the past."

His voice turned icy. "And you're the last person who should defend Evelyn. Don't think I don't know how you treated her."

Victoria froze, gaping at him. "What—what are you talking about?"

Daniel ignored her. A single glance at Ethan was enough. Security swiftly escorted Victoria out.

The room erupted into chaos.

"Enough." Theodore's voice cut through the noise as he seized the microphone. "We've said all there is to say today. Consider this press conference over."

The live feed cut to black.

Diana sat rigid in the mall, fists clenched so tight her nails bit into her palms.

Daniel had actually announced their divorce.

At Evelyn's press conference, no less.

Her teeth ground together, fury simmering beneath her skin.

Why?

Since childhood, she'd given up everything for him! She should have been his wife!

Her phone buzzed violently. Snatching it up, she hissed, "What?"

"Ms. Diana, we traced the hack. Someone accessed the telecom records—only a handful of people could pull that off." The man on the line sounded weary. "We're cross-referencing known hackers now."

Then, Mr. Prescott sighed. "The Master saw the broadcast. He's furious. You should come home."

Diana scoffed. "Not now."

A pause. Then, quietly: "You need to. Daniel's made his move. Even if you refuse to sign, he'll flaunt Evelyn publicly. Your only leverage is pressure—force him to reconcile. The Prescotts and Blackwoods have ties. Gregory Blackwood could intervene."

Diana's jaw tightened.

Finally, she rolled her eyes. "Fine. I'll visit."

Slamming the phone down, she stormed out of the mall—

Only for a black Maserati to screech to a halt in front of her.

The window rolled down. Ethan smirked. "Ma'am. Mr. Blackwood sent me. We're going to the courthouse."
###Chapter 323

Diana's brows knitted tightly as she circled the parked vehicle.

Ethan chuckled, keeping pace with her in the slow-moving car. "Running won't change anything, Mrs. Blackwood. Mr. Blackwood's orders are clear—I'm to take you to the courthouse, no exceptions."

She halted abruptly, shooting him an icy glare over her shoulder. "Tell Daniel this isn't happening. If he has issues, we'll talk them out. But divorce? Never. Not even for the children."

Undeterred, Ethan continued trailing her. Diana exhaled sharply. With her back turned, she discreetly slipped a pill into her mouth and swallowed.

Ten minutes later.

Daniel's phone buzzed at the café table. Ethan's voice crackled through. "Sir, Mrs. Blackwood collapsed. She's at Grandview Medical Center—they're performing emergency procedures now."

His grip tightened on the phone. "Details."

After everything, trust was a luxury he couldn't afford with Diana.

Ethan hesitated. "The doctors suspect it's complications from that old car wreck. Should I expect you?"

Daniel's breath hitched. The accident.

That storm-lashed night six years ago flashed before him—racing back from Mariner's Cove, arriving five hours too late. Standing soaked as search teams scoured the waves for Evelyn until dawn. Falling ill from exhaustion, only to hear the experts declare survival impossible. He'd punched one of them for saying it.

The memory had faded over time. Now it returned with brutal clarity—how hard they'd fought to be together.

A beat of silence. Then a resigned sigh. "I'm on my way."

Hanging up, Daniel met Evelyn's gaze across the table, guilt flickering in his eyes. "Diana's hospitalized. She collapsed."

Evelyn sipped her coffee, lips curving without warmth. "Perhaps you shouldn't divorce her after all, Mr. Blackwood."

His urgency now contradicted his earlier determination. The hypocrisy was almost impressive.

Daniel's jaw tensed. "The divorce stands. But she was once everything to me—sacrificed more than you know." He stood, shrugging into his coat. "As for your resignation? Denied. Try leaving Willowbrook, and I'll ensure you never work in this city again. Don't test me."

Evelyn's bitter laugh followed him. "You claim to hate who Diana became these past six years. But tell me—did you ever love the Evelyn Carter from before?"

He paused at the door, glancing back with a humorless smile. "What do you think?"

The door chimed shut. Evelyn exhaled, eyes closing.

She knew the answer. Daniel Blackwood loved only himself. Yet...

Earlier, at the press conference, when he'd shielded her from humiliation—redirecting every attack onto himself—she'd felt it. That treacherous flutter of hope. For one reckless moment, she'd wondered if change was possible. If the man beneath the infidelity and cruelty could be worth forgiving.

But no.

Leopards didn't change their spots. And Daniel? He'd always be the storm that destroyed everything in its path.
###Chapter 324

He had cheated on her with Serena Hart before.

Now, with Diana Hart by his side, their relationship was still tangled in ambiguity.

Even if they stayed together, another Serena would inevitably appear.

When Daniel Blackwood arrived at Grandview Medical Center, Diana had just been wheeled out of the emergency room.

"What happened?"

"Sir." Ethan Reynolds hesitated before speaking.

Thud.

He dropped to his knees, head bowed. "You told me to bring Diana home because you wanted to talk to her."

"But she’s been spying on you, doubting you at every turn. So I lied—said you wanted me to take her to the Civil Affairs Bureau for a divorce. I thought since you’d already announced the separation, a little scare wouldn’t hurt. I didn’t expect her to collapse..."

Daniel pinched the bridge of his nose, exhaling sharply.

He turned and sank onto the bench, fixing Ethan with a cold stare. "I don’t appreciate others making decisions for me."

Ethan stiffened, his head dipping lower. "I know. But I couldn’t stand her treating you like a criminal, watching your every move."

"Don’t let it happen again." Daniel leaned back, exhaustion lining his voice. "What did the doctors say?"

"They suspect it’s lingering nerve damage from her car accident years ago. The shock triggered it..."

Daniel shut his eyes briefly before standing and heading toward Diana’s room.

Inside, she lay motionless, an IV drip feeding into her veins.

Her face was ghostly pale, lips drained of color.

At the sound of the door, she stirred, brows knitting weakly as she lifted her gaze.

When she saw Daniel, she managed a fragile smile. "I didn’t think you’d come."

His frown deepened as he took the chair beside her bed. Voice softening, he asked, "Does your head still hurt?"

"A little."

Her eyes, glassy with unshed tears, met his. "I won’t be able to sign the papers today. Wait until I’m discharged..."

Noon sunlight streamed through the window, casting a golden glow over her delicate features—beautiful yet brittle.

Daniel’s chest tightened.

This was still the face he had once loved.

Even though she’d changed, that smile still unraveled him.

After a long pause, he spoke quietly. "The divorce isn’t urgent. Focus on recovering."

She’d gotten hurt because of him years ago. Now, with her condition flaring up, he couldn’t abandon her.

"I’m sorry." Diana’s lashes fluttered down, her voice a fragile whisper. "I never meant for things to turn out this way..."

"Six years apart… I just… I didn’t feel secure anymore."

A tear slipped free. She wiped it away with trembling fingers. "Evelyn Carter is extraordinary. I knew I couldn’t compete. That’s why I—"

"Leave the past behind." Daniel handed her a tissue, his tone weary. "I’ll make it up to her."

Diana’s grip on the sheets tightened. Ice flickered in her eyes, but she forced another tearful nod.

"You should. If she wants an apology from me, I’ll give it."

Watching her cry, Daniel released a heavy sigh.

"Diana, I thought when you came back, we could pick up where we left off. But maybe we’ve been apart too long. We’re not the same people anymore."

Her fingers twitched.

She looked up, hastily brushing away tears. "Daniel, what if I change? What if I become the Diana Hart you fell in love with? Would you still want this divorce?"
###Chapter 325

Diana's words plunged the room into silence.

Daniel's brow furrowed. He reached for the tissue on the table and handed it to her. "I did love Evelyn Carter in the past more than the version of you standing before me now. If you truly want to change, that's good. But if it hurts too much, don't force yourself."

In Daniel's eyes, expecting Diana to revert to the gentle, kind-hearted Evelyn from six years ago was nearly impossible.

He didn’t believe she should change for him. She had already sacrificed enough. Their relationship was ending—why should she suffer more just to please him?

"It won’t hurt!"

Just as Daniel started to withdraw his hand, Diana seized it. Her grip was desperate, her voice trembling. "Daniel, believe me. I can do it. I’ll become whoever you want me to be. Just tell me, and I’ll change. Please?"

Daniel’s expression darkened.

The frantic look in her eyes, the near-hysterical edge in her voice—it unsettled him.

The last woman who had made him feel this way was Vivian Prescott from Mariner’s Cove. The woman bound to him by an arranged marriage since childhood.

"Daniel, don’t leave me. Please?"

Her fingers dug into his arm, her desperation growing. "I’ve wanted to marry you since I was a child. Now that we’re finally together, I can’t lose you—"

Daniel’s eyes narrowed. He studied her face, his voice dangerously calm. "You said you’ve wanted to marry me since you were a child?"

Evelyn had met him when he was nearly seventeen.

She always claimed meeting him was the best thing that had happened to her in her youth.

So why was Diana now saying she’d loved him since childhood?

Diana froze. For two seconds, she stared blankly before forcing a laugh and releasing his arm. "I—I misspoke. I was too emotional."

Daniel smiled faintly. He brushed away the tear at the corner of her eye. "The way you acted just now… reminded me of someone."

Diana’s heart pounded. She bit her lip, refusing to meet his gaze.

"Who?"

"Vivian Prescott."

Daniel’s voice was low, his gaze piercing. "I’ve mentioned her before. She’s a lunatic."

The word struck her like a slap. Diana fought to keep her expression neutral, but her face paled.

The man she loved had just called her a lunatic.

She turned away, clearing her throat before forcing a bitter laugh. "Yes. She is."

Daniel watched her, noting the misery in her eyes. "Diana. I hope you don’t become as unhinged as her."

Then he turned and walked out.

Diana collapsed onto the bed, watching him leave. Her fists clenched so tightly her nails bit into her palms.

A lunatic.

Daniel Blackwood had called her a lunatic.

Fine. She’d show him exactly how far a lunatic could go.

She would stay by his side. She would eliminate Evelyn and those two brats. And she would make sure she was the only woman in his life—forever.

"Sir." Ethan approached the moment Daniel stepped out. "Is Miss Hart alright?"

"She’s fine." Daniel strode forward, then paused. He pulled out his phone and dialed Harrison Whitmore.

"You said Vivian went missing?"

Harrison seemed caught off guard by the question. After a beat, he chuckled.

"Yes. She’s become obsessed with plastic surgery lately. She’s been hopping between clinics worldwide. The Prescotts had me track her down recently. I even checked every clinic in Willowbrook."
###Chapter 326

"But later, Mr. Prescott informed me that he'd located her. He told me to stop searching."

Harrison smirked. "What? Scouting for your next wife already? Don't tell me you're actually considering Vivian Prescott?"

Daniel let out a dry chuckle, continuing down the corridor. "Since Vivian's been found..."

"I'll be in Mariner's Cove next week. Reach out to Mr. Prescott for me. Tell him I want to meet Vivian—take her to dinner."

Harrison's brows shot up. "Did hell freeze over? You can't be serious. You've always—"

"There are things I need to ask her."

Daniel exhaled sharply, voice dropping low. "Just do this for me."

Hearing his tone, Harrison swallowed his teasing. After a beat, he sighed. "Fine. I'll set it up."

The call ended. Daniel had just stepped out of Grandview Medical Center when Ethan rushed after him.

"Sir. Did you mention the Prescotts from Mariner's Cove?"

Daniel turned, frowning. "Why?"

Ethan handed him a file. "The investigation you requested—we have answers. The person funding the PR firm and troll network was Richard Prescott. The same man who spoke with Mrs. Blackwood."

He flipped the file open, pointing to a name. "He's the Prescott family's butler in Mariner's Cove."

Daniel's grip tightened on the papers, a vein pulsing at his temple.

The shadow orchestrator was Mr. Prescott—Diana Hart's contact.

Which meant Diana and the Prescotts were connected.

He shut the file with a snap. "Get me Willowbrook's top plastic surgeon. Now."

Ethan nodded. "On it."

Thirty minutes later, Ethan ushered Grace Thornton into Daniel's office.

"Mr. Blackwood."

Grace had never been here before. The space mirrored the man—sterile, imposing.

She sat cautiously. "Is Evelyn alright?"

Grace had been in surgery all day, repairing scars. No time for news. Barely time to eat before Ethan dragged her here.

"This isn't about Evelyn."

Daniel leaned back, studying her. "Tell me—how advanced is cosmetic surgery now?"

Grace blinked. "What?"

Daniel slid a photo of Harrison across the desk. "Show her, Ethan."

Ethan passed it to Grace, uneasy.

Daniel's gaze never wavered. "If I wanted to make Ethan look like this man—is it possible?"

Both Grace and Ethan stiffened.

After a pause, Grace examined Ethan's face, then the photo. "Theoretically, yes. But it would cost a fortune... and take years."

Daniel tilted his head. "Would six years be enough?"
###Chapter 327

Grace hesitated for a moment.

"Of course, six years is sufficient. Mr. Blackwood, why do you suddenly want to alter your assistant's..."

She trailed off mid-sentence, realization dawning. Evelyn had also left Daniel six years ago.

Evelyn had undergone plastic surgery too—a masterpiece crafted by foreign specialists.

Grace recognized Evelyn because of her face. That particular work had been her mentor's proudest achievement.

At the thought, Grace paled slightly. She quickly attempted to backtrack. "Naturally, different individuals face unique challenges. Success isn't guaranteed for everyone..."

She glanced down at the photo in her hand. "Take this man, for example. While handsome, his features lack refinement. Replicating him would be relatively straightforward..."

Just then, Harrison pushed the door open and froze.

Grace sat on the sofa, holding his photo, declaring his features unrefined.

"Who exactly are you calling unrefined?"

Grace blinked, then looked up. The man before her was identical to the one in the photo.

Her brows knitted. "You."

"Me?" Harrison strode forward, snatching the photo from her. "Who gave you permission to critique my appearance?"

Grace pressed her lips together, realizing she might have offended someone powerful.

She gestured carefully toward Daniel, seated in his chair. "Mr. Blackwood."

Harrison shot Daniel an exasperated look. "I bring you the finest dishes from across town, and this is how you repay me?"

Daniel chuckled, rising to his feet. He took both the photo and the food from Harrison, then placed them in Grace's hands.

"I know you haven't eaten. This is for you. As for the photo..."

He produced another image—this time of Ethan. "If I decide to proceed with altering my assistant's appearance to match Harrison's, draft a detailed surgical plan. Compensation won't be an issue."

From his pocket, he withdrew a check.

$500,000.

"This is the deposit."

Grace's eyes widened. She'd handled large sums before, but this was merely for a proposal—not even the actual procedure.

Tucking the check and photos into her bag, she beamed. "I'll have it ready as soon as possible. Thank you, Mr. Blackwood!"

With that, she grabbed her lunch and hurried out.

"Ethan, see her out."

Daniel remained by the window, watching Grace leave.

A faint smile played on his lips.

Once the door closed, Harrison dropped onto the sofa. "What the hell? You want to turn your assistant into me?"

"Don't you think..."

Daniel settled back into his chair. "Ethan's bone structure resembles Vivian's, while yours mirrors Diana's? If we can alter one, we can transform a woman into someone entirely different."

Harrison stilled.

Understanding dawned.

"You suspect Diana isn't Evelyn Carter, but Vivian?"

Daniel closed his eyes, avoiding a direct answer. "Have you arranged the meeting with Vivian?"

Harrison exhaled sharply. "That's why I'm here. It's done."
###Chapter 328

Daniel straightened his posture, his gaze intense as he studied Harrison.

"Vivian refused to see you."

Daniel's brow lifted slightly, but he remained silent.

"This is the first time you've ever requested a meeting with her. She should have agreed, but she didn't."

A faint smirk curved Daniel's lips. "What reason did she give?"

"She said your wife has returned. That there's no point."

"Tell her I will meet her. If she refuses, I'll represent the Blackwood family and sever all ties with the Prescotts."

Harrison's frown deepened. "Daniel, don't you think you're being... reckless? What if Vivian isn't Diana? What if this has nothing to do with them? Are you really willing to—"

"I need answers."

Daniel exhaled sharply, striding toward the floor-to-ceiling windows. His reflection stared back at him—cold, unyielding.

"I'd rather believe Diana is being impersonated."

Anything was better than accepting that the woman he once adored had become this calculating, this cruel after six years.

"Evelyn, we need to talk."

Grace stormed out of Blackwood Enterprises and hailed the first cab she saw, heading straight to Lakeside Residences.

When she arrived, Evelyn had just finished showering and was about to rest.

Grace dropped onto the plush rug, unpacking takeout containers onto the coffee table as she spoke between bites.

"Daniel's onto you."

Evelyn paused mid-motion, a towel still pressed to her damp hair. "What do you mean?"

"He showed me a photo of another man and his assistant. Then he asked if I could digitally alter the assistant's face to match his friend's—over a six-year span!"

Grace chewed thoughtfully, watching Evelyn's reaction. "Did you slip up somewhere?"

Evelyn stiffened.

She couldn’t recall any mistakes.

"You should stay away from him for now." Grace wiped her hands on a napkin. "He even demanded I outline the entire facial reconstruction process."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the towel. "Are you going to give it to him?"

"Of course. Money's money." Grace shrugged. "But procedures like this require dozens of specialized surgeries. Different experts, different stages."

"He probably wants to trace the surgeons. Narrow down who could pull off something this advanced."

Then Grace smirked. "But Evelyn, he'll never connect it to you. Your reconstruction was a complete overhaul—nothing like standard plastic surgery."

Evelyn let out a slow breath, lips quirking. "So you're giving him fake leads?"

"Consider it a distraction." Grace popped a fry into her mouth. "But until I finish that report, keep your distance. Don’t give him anything to work with."

Evelyn nodded. "I will."

Their conversation shifted to that morning’s press conference. They lounged on the sofa, binging a drama series between bites of food and idle chatter.

Two episodes in, Evelyn's phone rang.

Isabelle’s voice was frantic, choked with tears.

"Ms. Evelyn! The school just called—Liam and Emily have been taken!"
###Chapter 329

Evelyn shot up from the couch. "They've been kidnapped?"

"Yes."

Isabelle's voice trembled with tears. "I've already alerted Mr. Blackwood. He should be on his way. Are you coming too? The preschool teacher said they were playing with friends when a black van pulled up. Men in dark suits grabbed them before anyone could react."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. "I'm leaving now!"

She snatched her coat and bolted for the door.

Grace blocked her path. "Where's the fire?"

"Sophia and Liam were taken." Evelyn jammed her feet into sneakers without untying them. "By armed men."

Grace paled. She grabbed her keys. "I'm driving. Taxis won't cut it for this."

The car tires screeched as they peeled out. Evelyn clutched the seatbelt like a lifeline.

"Mom." Oliver's voice crackled through her pendant. "I've got a lock on them."

Evelyn nearly dropped the necklace. "Where?"

"Perimeter Drive." His typing echoed through the connection. "Liam activated his tracker the second they were taken. The signal cut out ten minutes ago, but traffic cams show a white van circling the highway."

Her pulse hammered in her throat. "Still on Perimeter?"

"Affirmative." A keyboard clattered. "Vehicle's registered to Mariner's Cove. Did Daniel make enemies there?"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Mariner's Cove. Her hometown. Where she'd first collided with Daniel during his business expansion.

The only people who'd held grudges there...

The Prescotts.

But even Vivian Prescott wouldn't cross this line. Would she?

"They're making another loop." Oliver's voice sharpened. "Mom—they're two exits from you."

Evelyn lunged forward. "Grace! Take the next ramp onto Perimeter!"

The car swerved violently.

"Are you insane?" Oliver's shout rattled the pendant. "You're up against professionals! Call Tyler and Dominic!"

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lip. Copper flooded her mouth. The highway signs blurred past.

"I'm alerting security now." Oliver exhaled hard. "Just...don't do anything reckless."

Too late. The van's taillights glowed red ahead of them.
###Chapter 330

Daniel had to admit his brother's enforcers were formidable.

But brute strength alone couldn't stop an entire convoy racing down Perimeter Drive.

Two men against a fleet? Impossible.

If they failed the first interception, their chances plummeted.

Only one person came to mind—someone with the skill, audacity, and motive to pull this off.

He exhaled sharply, fingers hovering over the keyboard.

Evelyn's intentions were transparent. She'd involve Tyler and Dominic, but never Daniel.

Yet lives hung in the balance.

With a decisive click, he inserted the encrypted drive and dialed through a proxy server.

Across town, Daniel stood outside the preschool gates, scanning traffic footage.

"Perimeter Drive, sir," Ethan reported. "But they've been circling for thirty minutes. We've lost visual."

Daniel massaged his temples. He'd considered trackers for Liam and Emily but feared stifling them.

Now that hesitation might cost everything.

The burner phone's vibration startled him. Unknown caller.

"Who is this?"

"Mr. Blackwood." The voice modulator crackled. "Your children are in a white van on Perimeter Drive. Grace and Evelyn are pursuing, but they'll only escalate the situation. You have a ten-minute window."

Daniel's grip tightened. "Why should I believe you?"

"Belief is irrelevant." Static punctuated each word. "I'm your only lead. The van's approaching the Harborview Bridge exit."

A hand signal sent Ethan scrambling to their vehicles.

"Identify yourself."

"All in due time." The line went dead.

Tires screeched as Daniel's convoy merged onto Perimeter Drive.

There—the white van. And trailing dangerously close, Grace's silver sedan.

"How did Dr. Thornton get here first?" Ethan's voice crackled over the radio.

Daniel's jaw clenched. That was the question.

The caller knew Evelyn's movements before he did. Which meant collusion.

But priorities shifted as the van swerved toward the exit ramp.

"Ethan," Daniel barked. "Box them in at the next intersection."
###Chapter 331

"Why are we being pursued by so many vehicles, Donovan?" The van driver shot a nervous glance at the black SUVs gaining on them. "They're closing in fast. We need to slow down."

In the backseat, Donovan scowled. He peered through the tinted windows. "This is far enough. Take the next exit."

He delivered a sharp kick to the bound children at his feet. "Don't move a muscle!"

Liam and Emily Carter had been tied back-to-back and shoved beneath Donovan's seat. In the past hour alone, the kidnapper had kicked them repeatedly.

Liam's jeans had ridden up during the struggle, exposing shins mottled with dark bruises. Emily's legs remained untouched - clear evidence of her brother's protection.

Donovan sneered. "How chivalrous. Protecting your sister like some knight in shining armor."

Liam locked eyes with the man, jaw clenched tight, refusing to respond.

"Stubborn brat." Donovan drove his boot into the boy's spine, pinning him down while snapping a photo with his phone. He sent it to his employer with the caption: [Enjoying the show?]

The reply came instantly: [Don't kill them yet. If they die, I want it slow and painful.]

[Understood!] Donovan's fingers hovered over the screen when a deafening crash rocked the van. The vehicle lurched to a violent stop.

Before Donovan could react, the side door flew open. Cold steel pressed against his jugular.

"Out. Now." The blade-wielding man's voice left no room for argument.

Hands raised, Donovan stepped onto the asphalt.

"Liam! Emily!" Evelyn Carter's car couldn't maneuver through Daniel Blackwood's security detail. She abandoned it hundreds of yards back, sprinting toward the van like a woman possessed.

She shoved through the wall of bodyguards. Daniel was already inside, working at the children's restraints.

Evelyn's composure shattered. Tears streamed down her face as she took in her children's injuries. She gathered them into a crushing embrace. "Are you hurt? I was terrified! If anything happened to you—"

Emily sniffled, patting her mother's back. "We're okay, Mommy."

Liam wriggled free enough to wipe Evelyn's tears with grimy fingers. "We're alive, Mom. That's what matters."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Liam's face was a canvas of bruises, his clothes torn. Emily appeared equally disheveled but remarkably less injured.

The truth struck Evelyn like a physical blow - her son had shielded his sister throughout the ordeal. Biting her lip, she scooped Emily into one arm while grasping Liam's hand. "Let's get you both to Grandview Medical Center..."
###Chapter 332

"It's just a few scrapes. No need for the hospital. We can treat them at home with some cream." Liam wiped away a tear trailing down his cheek. "Don't worry."

He turned to glance at Daniel, who stood watching them. "Mr. Blackwood."

Lifting his chin, Liam fixed his clear eyes on Daniel. "Emily and I are going to Mommy's place now. Thank you for saving us."

Daniel's gaze shifted from Evelyn to the boy before him. He crouched down. "I'm your father. You don't need to thank me."

"True, but I wanted to anyway." Liam hesitated, then added, "The people who took us didn’t want to kill us or demand ransom. It seemed like they just wanted to hurt us as revenge. Did you make any enemies recently?"

Daniel almost laughed. "No, I haven’t."

"Strange…" Liam frowned, then sighed and took Daniel’s hand. "Still, thank you. I’ll take care of Miss Evelyn and Princess Emily now. You stay and handle those criminals."

With that, he skipped over to Evelyn, took her hand, and they climbed into Grace’s car.

Daniel remained still, watching the car shrink into the distance until it vanished.

"Someone hired us… ordered us to beat those kids…" After Ethan’s relentless interrogation, Donovan finally cracked. "The client said they were his enemy’s children. We couldn’t kill them, just hurt them badly."

Donovan knelt, trembling. "We didn’t know they were yours! I thought they were just spoiled brats—a few kicks would be enough! I never meant—"

Ethan scoffed and kicked him again. "You’re a grown man attacking six-year-olds! You’re as heartless as your employer!"

Daniel frowned. He strode to the van, rummaged inside, and found Donovan’s phone wedged in a corner.

The chat history with the employer was still open. After scanning it, Daniel handed the phone to Ethan. "Investigate this."

Just then, his phone rang—the same mysterious informant from before.

"Don’t bother tracking the employer," the distorted voice said. This time, it sounded different. "I already did. The kidnappers were hired by Vanessa Prescott—the woman from this morning’s press conference. I’ve sent her address to your inbox. If you hurry, you’ll catch her."

Daniel’s grip tightened on his phone. He walked away, staring at the wind-tossed trees. "You’re an advanced hacker. I feel like we’ve met before."

At his desk, Oliver glanced at the ruined laptop nearby—the one Daniel had destroyed in their past hacking duel. "You’re right. We have."

Long ago, Oliver had tried to smear Evelyn online to get back at Serena. Back then, they’d clashed in a digital battle.

Daniel’s brow furrowed. "Who are you? Why do you care so much about Evelyn and my children?"
###Chapter 333

Daniel's sharp interrogation made Oliver tense. His voice, though quiet, carried an edge that sliced through the phone line. Even miles apart, Oliver could almost see those obsidian eyes boring into him, unrelenting. The weight of it crushed his lungs.

Oliver exhaled shakily, fingers twisting the hem of his hospital gown. For the first time, uncertainty gnawed at him. "Mr. Blackwood, my identity has nothing to do with Evelyn or the others. When the time is right, I'll reveal myself."

A low chuckle vibrated through the receiver. "You sound young."

Despite the voice modulator, Daniel caught the faint tremor of panic. "Let's meet."

"No." Oliver ended the call abruptly. The moment the line disconnected, he sagged against the headboard, chest heaving. His pulse roared in his ears. He hadn't felt this rattled in years—not since Daniel had first hacked into his laptop.

Gritting his teeth, Oliver shoved off the bed and stalked to the desk. He flipped open the damaged device.

[Wait till I get my hands on you. — Daniel Blackwood]

The green text glared back at him. Oliver traced the name with a fingertip, throat tight.

This was his father.

What kind of man was he?

Oliver had spent years despising Daniel, never wanting to cross paths. But now...

He shut his eyes, the doctor's words echoing. "Your mother doesn't know your condition has worsened. Without a donor match, you have less than a year."

A bitter smile twisted his lips.

Mr. Daniel Blackwood. Try harder. I need to meet you before it's too late.

Willowbrook.

Daniel didn't immediately pursue the caller's location. The hacker was skilled—tracking him wouldn't be easy.

Then an anonymous text buzzed in. A GPS pin in the city center. His brow furrowed as he forwarded it to Ethan. "Move out now."

Within minutes, the convoy sped toward the address.

Downtown Apartment.

Vanessa smirked at the photo Donovan had sent—Liam and Emily's faces pressed under his boot. She should've sent this to Diana sooner.

Meanwhile, Diana lay in her hospital bed, seething. She needed to explain this mess to Mr. Prescott and evade Daniel's suspicion.

[Something to cheer you up, Diana!]

Diana scowled at Vanessa's text. [Nothing will cheer me up except Daniel loving me.]

[Oh, this will.] The attached photo made Diana's blood run cold.

Her fingers trembled as she zoomed in. Those children—Daniel's entire world.

[Vanessa, have you lost your mind?!] Diana had been scheming to eliminate them since arriving at Silvercrest Manor. Now this reckless move could ruin everything.
###Chapter 334

Diana Hart didn't dare harm the children. She couldn't risk repeating Serena's mistake and revealing herself. Besides, she wasn't sure if Daniel Blackwood trusted her yet.

How could Vanessa Prescott be reckless enough to attempt kidnapping them?

"What are you so afraid of?" Vanessa pursed her lips. "The men I hired are from Mariner's Cove. They're not locals, and the number I used is encrypted. No one can trace it back to me. And I didn't even order them to kill the kids—just rough them up a little."

"Diana, since when did you become so timid?"

Diana inhaled sharply. She wasn't timid—she was careful.

"Delete all traces of communication and leave Willowbrook immediately. Go back to Mariner's Cove. Now." Diana's grip on the phone tightened. "Get out before it's too late!"

Vanessa had been pampered by Mr. Prescott her entire life. She didn’t understand the danger she was in. The Prescotts might be powerful in Mariner's Cove, but this was Willowbrook. Daniel Blackwood ruled here.

On the other end, Vanessa scoffed. "Diana, you're overreacting. Nothing will—"

A frantic knock cut her off.

"Someone's here. I have to go." Vanessa set the phone down without hanging up.

Diana heard everything.

Vanessa's shocked gasp. "Daniel Blackwood? What are you doing here?"

The door slammed.

Then Daniel's voice, cold and controlled. "Why do you think I'm here, Miss Prescott?"

Diana ended the call. She clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

That fool.

She forced herself to think. Anger wouldn’t help now. She had to get Vanessa out before Daniel broke her. Vanessa had never faced real consequences—she'd crack under pressure.

A plan formed in Diana's mind.

Her hands trembled as she dialed another number.

Lakeside Residences

Evelyn Carter carefully applied ointment to Liam's bruises. Emily stood beside him, clutching his hand, her eyes red-rimmed. "Thank you, Liam."

He patted her head gently. "You're my sister. Of course I'd protect you."

Emily's tears spilled over.

Evelyn sighed, about to speak, when her phone rang. An unknown number.

She handed the ointment to Emily and answered. "Who is this?"

"Diana."

Evelyn froze. Her grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. "What do you want?"

"There's been a misunderstanding." Diana's voice was smooth. "I want to make a deal."
###Chapter 335

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the phone. A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Did I hear you right, Diana? You orchestrated the kidnapping of my children. Liam and Sophia are sitting right here, nursing their injuries. And now you want to negotiate? There's nothing to discuss."

Diana leaned back against the hospital pillows, shutting her eyes. "What if I told you this was about Daniel and me getting divorced?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Explain."

Taking a shaky breath, Diana chose her words carefully. "I didn't arrange the kidnapping. You know I'm not that reckless. If I wanted to hurt your children, I'd have chosen a smarter method."

Evelyn's grip on the phone tightened. "Get to the point."

"Daniel's filing for divorce," Diana said, her voice cracking slightly. "Here's my offer - convince Daniel to release Vanessa, and I won't pursue custody of Liam and Sophia."

Evelyn's laughter was sharp and humorless. "Have you lost your mind?"

"You're seriously suggesting I bargain with my children's future to free the woman who harmed them? Do you think Daniel's a fool? He'll connect you to Vanessa instantly. And since when did you think you could win a custody battle against me?"

Diana's face paled. She knew Evelyn was right, but desperation clawed at her. "Name your terms then. Anything to keep Vanessa free."

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "How about you stop pretending to be me and reveal your true identity?"

"Never!" Diana's response was immediate. "Anything but that."

"Then we're done here." Evelyn moved to end the call.

"Wait!" Diana's voice turned frantic. "I can get you in touch with Richard and Victoria Sinclair!"

Evelyn froze.

Seeing her hesitation, Diana pressed her advantage. "You don't want this estrangement to last forever, do you? You're tired of being compared to Serena. Right now, your parents believe I'm you. They defended me publicly, supported me completely - all because they think I'm their real daughter."

"I can fix this. I can make them see the truth about you..."

Evelyn's breath caught. Serena's words from their last meeting echoed in her mind: "We share a father but different mothers. Your real sister was sent away while I took her place." The suspicion that Diana might be that lost sister had haunted Evelyn for months.

A heavy sigh escaped Evelyn's lips. Victoria's rejection had driven her to sever ties with the Sinclairs completely. Yet now...

The phone trembled in her hand as old wounds reopened.
###Chapter 336

But Victoria was her birth mother after all.

She had been deceived by Richard all these years, raising Serena as if she were her own daughter.

If Evelyn was truly Victoria's youngest daughter...

Taking a sharp breath, Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I can help you. But I have conditions. First, you must promise Vanessa Prescott will never step foot in Willowbrook again. Second, you must treat Mom and Dad as your real parents—especially Mom."

"I promise!"

The moment Evelyn spoke, Diana agreed without hesitation.

All those two greedy people—Victoria and Richard—cared about was money.

Whether it was the Prescott family or the Blackwood family, both were equally wealthy!

"Fine."

Evelyn hesitated. "But I can only promise to ask Daniel to spare her. Whether he actually does... that's not up to me."

"That's enough, just ask him!"

Diana's voice trembled with urgency. "Vanessa was caught by Daniel ten minutes ago. Do it now."

Evelyn hummed in response.

Before ending the call, she asked one last question. "Did you grow up in an orphanage?"

On the other end, Diana paused. "Yes. Why?"

"Nothing."

Hanging up, Evelyn exhaled deeply and turned around.

From the sofa, two pairs of wide eyes stared back at her.

Three gazes locked in the air.

Finally, Liam crossed his arms with a pout. "Didn't we agree helping Grandma with Serena was the last time?"

"We did."

Sophia lowered her head, studying her tiny fingers with a frown. "Won't Liam's pain be for nothing if we just let that horrible woman go?"

Evelyn sighed, walking over to ruffle the little girl's hair. "We agreed to let her live. We didn't say she'd leave unharmed. How badly she gets hurt... well, that's still undecided. As long as she's breathing, we've kept our word, right?"

Sophia blinked, confused.

"Idiot," Liam muttered, shifting on the sofa with a wince. "What Mom means is we'll make her pay for what she did to us."

His gaze darkened. "The person behind our kidnapping never wanted us dead—just hurt enough to satisfy her anger. For someone like that, Daniel would probably return the favor. Beat her, maybe lock her up for a while before sending her home. All we're doing is speeding up the process."

Then he held out his hand. "Give me the phone. I'll talk to him. Wouldn't want him thinking you don't care enough, Mom."

Evelyn handed it over with another sigh. "Does it still hurt?"

"Not as much after the ointment."

The boy took the phone, inhaled sharply, and slipped into the master bedroom, shutting the door behind him.

Sophia propped her chin on her hands, watching him go. "Why is Liam hiding the call from us?"

Evelyn smirked. "Probably discussing with your father how to handle Vanessa Prescott. It might get... graphic. He doesn’t want us hearing the details."
###Chapter 337

Liam stayed in the bedroom for exactly thirty minutes.
When he emerged, he handed the phone back to his mother with practiced grace. "Done. Tell Diana to send someone for that woman now."

Evelyn arched a brow, studying her son's smug expression. "Daniel actually agreed to release her that easily?"

Liam flopped onto the sofa, swinging his short legs. "How could he say no to his adorable son?"

With a sigh, Evelyn stepped onto the balcony to make the call.

The moment she left, Liam's playful demeanor faded. He turned to Sophia, who was sketching a necklace design. "Think it's too late for me to learn hacking?"

Sophia didn't even glance up. "Oliver's skills are innate. So are mine. Don't embarrass yourself."

Liam groaned. "But Daniel's getting suspicious. He asked if I knew programming earlier. Said he met a young hacker connected to us."

Sophia's pencil stilled. Her eyes widened. "What do we do?"

Liam chewed his lip. "Still figuring that out."

Though Oliver and Daniel had barely interacted, the man was relentless. Once he started digging, Oliver's identity would be exposed.

And if that happened...

Evelyn's entire plan for returning to Willowbrook would unravel.

Oliver, proud and stubborn, would never let their mother be manipulated because of him. He'd rather—

Liam cut off the thought. The weight pressing on his small shoulders grew heavier.

"Maybe we tell Daniel Oliver taught me hacking?" he suggested.

Sophia scoffed. "With your zero skills? He'd see through that in seconds."

Liam shot up. "Then I'll learn!"

He stormed to his room, grabbed the modified necklace, and activated its hidden communicator. "Oliver, crash course in hacking. Now."

In his hospital bed, Oliver watched medicine drip into his veins. His response was flat. "Daniel was a hacker. Basic tricks won't fool him."

Liam huffed. "I'm a fast learner!"

"I know what you're afraid of." Oliver's gaze drifted to the window. His voice was hollow. "I watched the press conference. After the divorce... will he chase Mom?"

Liam hesitated. "Possibly."

Oliver closed his eyes. "If only Daniel wasn't such an idiot."

Grandview Medical Center

Diana studied the photo Vanessa had sent. Then the battered woman before her.

The bruises mirrored Liam's perfectly.

But darker. Deeper. More vicious.

A cold smile curled Diana's lips. "How petty."

Daniel had made Vanessa suffer the same wounds as Liam. First as punishment.

Then as a warning.
###Chapter 338

Some men never forgot a slight, no matter how small.

"Evelyn, it hurts so much."

Vanessa Prescott's face was wrapped in bandages like a mummy. Her voice cracked with tears. "Daniel seems so refined on the surface, but he's utterly ruthless! Evelyn, you have to make him pay for this."

Evelyn Carter shot her a cold glare. "Make him pay? You're a fool."

If she wasn't worried Vanessa might break under Daniel's interrogation, she wouldn't have bothered saving her worthless life.

Tears welled in Vanessa's eyes. "Everything I did was for you! Now Daniel Blackwood has done this to me and ordered me out of Willowbrook by tonight—or he'll call the police. Evelyn, we grew up together. I'm in this state because of you. You won't abandon me, will you?"

Evelyn scoffed. "For me? Did I ask you to interfere? You brought this on yourself."

Yesterday, Vanessa had confronted Daniel and Evelyn in the market behind her back, flaunting her identity as Evelyn's best friend.

She hadn’t even scolded her for that reckless move, and now this mess?

"Mr. Prescott spoiled you rotten. Sending you to Willowbrook to assist me was a mistake."

Vanessa sniffled. "So all of this was for nothing?"

"For now, you'll have to endure it."

Evelyn took a sharp breath. "The car will be here soon. Go back to Mariner's Cove."

Mr. Prescott was right—it was time for her to return and appease the old man.

Otherwise, Daniel might actually divorce her.

And if he did, all six years of her transformation would be wasted.

To cheer up her two little wounded soldiers, Evelyn prepared a lavish dinner.

The three of them had just settled at the dining table when the doorbell rang.

Sophia, thinking it was her father, leaped from her seat. "I'll get it!"

The little girl skipped to the door and swung it open—only to freeze.

Standing there wasn’t Daniel, but Theodore Allen, his expression one of mild surprise.

Sophia recognized him.

Not because he’d once been her mother’s idol, but because she and Liam had watched his press conference earlier.

He’d been too friendly with her mother.

Instantly, the little princess bristled. Her mission was clear—get her parents back together. Theodore was an obstacle.

"Are you here to see Mommy for something important? We’re eating dinner."

Theodore took in the girl’s scowl, so like her father’s, and chuckled. "If you’re eating, doesn’t that mean I arrived at the perfect time?"

Sophia’s face darkened, but before she could retort, Evelyn appeared behind her.

The woman laughed lightly and pulled the door wider. "Since you’re here, join us. Let me know what you think of the food."

Theodore strode in without hesitation, settling beside Liam. "What a feast."

Sophia internally rolled her eyes and trudged back to the table.

The seating arrangement was unintentionally symbolic—Evelyn and Sophia on one side, Theodore and Liam on the other.

After a few sullen bites, Sophia discreetly lifted her phone.

She snapped several photos of Theodore sitting beside her brother—and sent them straight to Daniel.
###Chapter 339

The Blackwood Estate blazed with lights.

Daniel lounged on the sofa, idly scrolling through his phone while enduring the scolding from his grandmother and father.

"Since when do you make such reckless decisions without consulting us?"

"Diana is the mother of your children! Do we mean nothing to you?"

"And you're throwing her away for Evelyn Carter?"

Eleanor Blackwood struck her cane against the marble floor with a sharp crack. "I warned you about that girl! First, she drove Serena away, now she's breaking up your marriage! She's nothing but trouble!"

Gregory Blackwood's frown deepened. "Think of the children, Daniel. Divorce isn't something to take lightly."

Daniel remained silent, his fingers tapping against his phone screen.

After a long pause, he finally lifted his gaze. "Father, weren't you the one pushing me to marry Vivian Prescott not too long ago?"

Gregory's expression darkened.

Before he could respond, Daniel's phone buzzed.

The photos Emily had sent him—snapped secretly—showed Theodore Allen seated at Evelyn's dining table, laughing with Liam as if they were family.

[I don’t like him. Come now.]

Daniel's jaw tightened.

Not only had Evelyn invited Theodore into her home, but she’d let him sit with his children?

He stood abruptly, his stormy expression unreadable. "I have somewhere to be."

"Daniel Blackwood!"

Eleanor slammed her cane down again, her voice trembling with fury. "How dare you walk out while we're speaking to you!"

He didn’t even glance back. "Since when have either of you ever influenced my decisions?"

Their opinions had never mattered before. Tonight was no exception.

Lakeside Residences

Theodore grinned as he helped himself to another serving. "Since you skipped work today, does that mean you'll be buried in deadlines tomorrow?"

Evelyn sighed. "Probably."

"I could help. Art and design aren’t that different."

Emily pouted. "Mommy doesn’t need your help. I can assist her."

Liam nodded solemnly. "The internet says you haven’t released new artwork in six months. That’s called procrastination."

Theodore choked on his drink.

Why did these kids despise him so much?

Changing tactics, he brought up the press conference. "So, is Daniel really divorcing Diana?"

Outside the door, Daniel froze, his fist hovering mid-knock.

Inside, Evelyn shrugged. "Maybe."

"You don’t seem bothered."

Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. "Why would I be? His marriage has nothing to do with me."

Theodore smirked, sliding a chicken wing onto her plate. "I thought you had feelings for him."

"What gave you that idea?"

Her voice was ice. "Even if I loved a hundred men, Daniel Blackwood would never be one of them."

The past had taught her that much.

Some wounds never fully healed.
###Chapter 340

Evelyn's light voice carried clearly to Daniel's ears.
His brows knitted together tightly.

Inside the apartment, Sophia stole a glance at the clock.
Twenty minutes had passed since she sent those photos to her father.
He should have arrived by now, no matter how far he was!

Pursing her lips, the little girl discreetly lifted her phone and sent another message.
"Daddy, where are you?"

The notification chime rang sharply in the hallway outside.
Everyone at the dining table froze. That sound came from right beyond their door!

Liam reacted first, hopping off his chair and striding to the entrance.
"Mr. Blackwood?"

The boy stared at the man in the doorway with wide eyes, then suddenly turned to Sophia as if realizing something.
Caught red-handed, the little girl lowered her head in shame.

Theodore turned toward the imposing figure in the entryway, his expression flickering between surprise and thinly veiled contempt.

The apartment walls were paper-thin.
Daniel had been standing right outside—they'd even heard his phone ring.
Which meant...

Judging by his stormy expression, he'd overheard everything.

Theodore's lips curled into a smirk. "Mr. Blackwood! Perfect timing. We're just having dinner—care to join us?"
His casual invitation made him sound more like the host than Daniel ever could.

Daniel's face darkened like thunderclouds gathering.
His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn with icy intensity.

Evelyn forced an awkward smile. "Come in."
Having him linger in the hallway would only cause more problems.

At her words, Daniel narrowed his eyes slightly before stepping inside.
Liam quickly dragged over an extra chair. "Sit."

Daniel sat stiffly, his frown deepening.
The small table barely accommodated four—his presence made it painfully crowded.
And after what he'd just overheard...

The atmosphere grew thick with tension.

Finally, Sophia gathered her courage.
"Daddy, you promised if Mommy finalized that jewelry design, we could all go out together?"

Daniel's spoon paused mid-air. "Yes."

The girl blinked innocently. "So...will you come with us? Liam and I have been back with you for ages, but you never really play with us."

A faint smile touched Daniel's lips. "Of course."

"No."
Evelyn's rejection came sharp as a knife.

"If Mr. Blackwood wants time with the children, pick another day.
Our outing is my reward—just me and them."

Daniel's jaw tightened. "You despise my company that much?"
Evelyn turned away without answering.

Sophia bit her lip. "Was...was my idea bad?"

"Your idea was perfect," Theodore interjected cheerfully. "Why don't I tag along too? The five of us could make it a proper family outing."

Daniel's laugh was cold. "I'm their father. Evelyn's their foster mother. And you? What exactly are you?"

Theodore grinned. "Evelyn's boyfriend. That enough for you?"
###Chapter 341

The tension in the dining room thickened instantly.

Daniel's icy gaze flicked from Theodore to Evelyn. His lips curled into a mocking smirk. "Does anyone here actually acknowledge you as Evelyn's boyfriend?"

Theodore's eyes narrowed but he remained silent.

Evelyn frowned, studying Daniel's disdainful expression. After a beat, she smiled coolly. "Theodore is my boyfriend. If Mr. Blackwood insists on joining our outing with the kids, then I’ll bring him along. Five people on a trip isn’t so bad."

She hoped this would make Daniel back off.

She knew how much he despised Theodore. There was no way he’d willingly vacation with him.

But then—

Both men answered at the same time.

"Sure."

"No problem."

Evelyn blinked.

She glanced at Theodore beside her, then at Daniel across the table.

One wore a calm smile. The other’s eyes burned with dark intensity.

She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out.

Finally, she lowered her head and focused on her food.

"Eat slowly," Theodore murmured, adding salad to her plate.

Daniel immediately retaliated by scooping roasted potatoes onto it.

Theodore added more salad. Daniel piled on more potatoes.

Within minutes, Evelyn’s plate was a mountain of food.

Yet the two men continued their silent battle.

Emily slammed her utensils down with a huff. "Could you two act like adults? Liam and I still need to eat!"

Liam quickly hopped off his chair, grabbed his sister’s hand, and pulled her away. "Come on, let’s get fried chicken. We shouldn’t get involved in their fight."

Emily shot Theodore a glare. "This is your fault!"

If he hadn’t insisted on dinner, she wouldn’t have called Daniel.

If she hadn’t called Daniel, the table wouldn’t have turned into a battlefield.

Theodore looked genuinely baffled. "What did I do?"

"Calling yourself Evelyn’s boyfriend was your first mistake," Daniel said coolly as the kids left. He messaged Ethan to keep an eye on them, then loosened his collar—revealing a dark mark on his neck.

A hickey.

Theodore stiffened.

Daniel had deliberately shown him that.

And there was only one person who could have left it.

Evelyn frowned at Theodore’s silence, then followed his gaze.

Her face paled.

That mark…

She’d bitten Daniel last night in a fit of frustration.

She hadn’t thought about the placement—just lashed out where she could reach.

Now, the memory flooded back.

Her cheeks burned.

Theodore watched her reaction closely.

With a quiet sigh, he set down his fork, picked up his wine, and drained the glass.

Truthfully, he already knew.

He’d known Daniel had visited Evelyn multiple times.

He’d known he’d stayed in her room.

He knew everything.
###Chapter 342

Daniel tried to convince himself nothing had transpired between them.
But now...

He set the empty glass down with a clink, turning to offer Evelyn a strained smile.

"Suddenly craving fried chicken," he muttered, running a hand through his hair. "Think I'll join Liam and Emily."

The door slammed shut behind him before Evelyn could respond. She squeezed her eyes shut, nails digging into her palms.

Theodore must think her a liar. A fraud.

How many times had she insisted she felt nothing for Daniel?

But indifference toward him was one thing. Saving Oliver was another matter entirely.

Yet she couldn't explain the truth to every person who misjudged her.

"Feeling guilty?"

Daniel's mocking voice slithered against her ear, laced with venom.

Evelyn's eyes flew open just as he shoved her back into the chair, caging her in with his arms. His gaze burned hotter than his whiskey-laced breath.

"Known him what, a few weeks?" His knuckles whitened on the armrests. "And already mourning his departure?"

She turned her face away, jaw clenched.

Daniel caught her chin, forcing her to meet his stormy eyes. "Tell me, Evelyn. Am I inadequate? Or are you just that desperate for male attention?"

"Daniel Blackwood!" She spat his name like a curse.

His lips curled. "Ah, there's that fire."

Leaning down, he grazed his mouth along the shell of her ear. "Until I decide to release you," he whispered, "no other man touches what's mine."

Evelyn barked out a laugh.

She tilted her head back, defiance flashing in her eyes. "You parade women around while playing devoted husband to Diana, yet I can't even speak to another man?"

Daniel's pupils dilated.

A slow, dangerous smile spread across his face. "Jealous of Diana, are we?"

"Don't flatter yourself." She rolled her eyes.

"Your tells are obvious, sweetheart."

Without warning, he crushed his lips to hers, swallowing her protests.

Then she was airborne, tossed onto the king-sized bed with terrifying ease.

Evelyn braced herself against the mattress. "You reek of whiskey. Shower first—"

Daniel hauled her up with a dark chuckle. "We'll shower together."

Ten minutes later, steam fogged the bathroom mirrors as Evelyn shoved at his chest. "This wasn't the deal!"

He pinned her wrists above her head. "I never said it was."

"Daniel, I have deadlines tomorrow," she gasped as his teeth grazed her collarbone. "New designs for Celestial Dreams—"

"Reschedule."

His phone buzzed on the counter. Ignoring it, he bit down on her shoulder. "We're flying to Mariner's Cove tomorrow."

"Mariner's Cove?" Her muscles tensed.

"Business with the Prescotts." His hands stilled. "Personal matters too."

The Prescotts.

Daniel had avoided that family for years, ever since Vivian Prescott humiliated him at their failed engagement party.

Now he was voluntarily visiting them?

Evelyn recalled today's press conference—how he'd announced his divorce from Diana before racing off to see the woman originally meant to be his bride.

"This trip... it's about Vivian?"

"Yes."

Her stomach plummeted.

First Serena, then Diana, now Vivian Prescott?

The man truly left no vacancy in his bed.
###Chapter 343

The phone rang at dawn, jolting Evelyn Carter awake.

Daniel Blackwood's voice came through crisp and commanding. "Dominic's waiting downstairs. We're spending the week in Mariner's Cove. Pack your bags."

She hung up with a frustrated sigh.

Glancing at the clock, the digital display read 6:58am.

After keeping her up half the night, how did he still have this much energy?

By the time she finished showering, Liam and Sophia stood waiting in the living room beside an oversized suitcase.

"Safe travels!" they chirped in unison when she emerged.

Evelyn chuckled, unzipping the luggage to find seven meticulously packed outfits, toiletries, and her unfinished sketches neatly tucked in the side pocket.

Only Sophia would think of everything.

Liam might be attentive, but he was still a boy at heart.

She ruffled her daughter's silky hair. "Thanks, sweetheart."

Sophia pouted. "I wanted to come, but Daddy said it's a business trip."

Liam patted her shoulder like a miniature adult. "After negotiations, Mr. Blackwood agreed to bring Tyler and Dominic for your protection." He sighed dramatically. "Mom, this is your first trip without us. Don't forget to eat properly."

Evelyn bit back a laugh. "I'm the parent here, remember?"

"Parents need looking after too," Sophia countered.

Evelyn shook her head. She'd spoiled them rotten, and this was her reward - being mothered by her own children.

After reminding Liam to watch over his sister, she wheeled the suitcase downstairs.

Dominic Shaw sprang into action when he spotted her. "Mr. Blackwood left ahead. It's a five-hour drive to Mariner's Cove." He eyed her cautiously. "You don't get carsick, right?"

She shook her head and slid into the backseat.

As the car merged onto the highway, Dominic launched into stories about his childhood friends from the mountains.

One name made Evelyn's breath catch - the man who'd been childhood friends with Penelope.

"Oh him." Dominic's expression darkened. "Got a new job from his old employer - the same one from six years back. Probably another hit." He shook his head. "I'm cutting ties with that guy."

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins.

This was the driver who'd run her off Harborview Bridge.

Hired by Daniel and Serena Hart.

With Serena exiled overseas, only one person could have summoned him now.

Daniel.

Her mind raced to yesterday - how he'd rushed to meet Vivian Prescott right after filing divorce papers against Diana Hart.

A fresh wave of dread crashed over her.

Was history repeating itself?

Even as Diana's enemy, Evelyn recognized the danger - the imposter was currently posing as her.

He wasn't after Diana.

He wanted to kill Evelyn Carter. Again.

Closing her eyes, she realized no winter could compare to this chilling revelation freezing her heart.
###Chapter 344

The warmth and tenderness built over months vanished in a heartbeat.

Once again, Daniel Blackwood proved he was the same ruthless, emotionless man he'd always been.

Six years ago, he had calmly told her he'd take her to the doctor after his business trip.

Then returned home and coldly orchestrated her death.

Now, six years later, he could publicly declare his love for his wife while divorcing her—and still plot her murder.

All drowsiness fled Evelyn's body.

Sitting in the car, Dominic's chatter flowed in one ear and out the other.

All she could see was Daniel's icy, detached expression.

The four-hour drive should have felt endless.

But with her emotions in turmoil, it passed in a blur.

By noon, they entered the city limits of Mariner's Cove.

This was where Evelyn had grown up.

She hadn't set foot here since marrying Daniel.

Returning to her hometown after so long should have filled her with nostalgia.

Instead, she felt nothing but numbness.

As soon as the car stopped at the Starlight Grand Hotel, she spotted Daniel waiting at the entrance.

He stood beside a marble pillar, phone pressed to his ear.

Beneath the hotel's opulent lighting, his sharp profile looked devastatingly handsome.

Last night, they had been as close as two people could be.

Now, he might as well have been on another planet.

Dominic handed her the suitcase.

Evelyn took a deep breath and dragged it toward the hotel.

The moment she passed Daniel, he ended the call and seized her wrist.

She froze.

Glancing up, she met his gaze. "Something you need, Mr. Blackwood?"

His brow furrowed. He yanked the suitcase from her and shoved it at Ethan.

"The Prescotts are hosting a welcome dinner for us."

Evelyn pulled her arm free. "That dinner is for you. I won't be attending."

She turned toward the lobby.

Daniel caught up in two strides. "What the hell is your problem?"

Last night, she'd been warm in his arms. Now she recoiled from his touch.

Evelyn gave him a cold look. "This is a business trip. If the dinner isn't work-related, I have every right to decline."

Her tone—like she was drawing a professional boundary between them—made him scoff.

"You think I'd bring you to a private event as my date? Don't flatter yourself."

He released her wrist, staring down at her. "The Prescotts dominate Mariner's Cove's jewelry market. That's the only reason you're coming to this dinner."

Evelyn hesitated.

Before she could respond, a woman's voice cut in.

"Daniel?"

Diana Hart stood at the entrance, eyes wide. "What are you doing here? Did you come to see me?"
###Chapter 345

Daniel Blackwood regarded Evelyn Carter with detached indifference, his gaze devoid of any warmth. "This is strictly business."

"Oh, I understand."

Evelyn didn't show a trace of disappointment. Instead, a faint smile played on her lips. "What a coincidence—I'm staying at this hotel too. When you leave, could I hitch a ride?"

Daniel's eyes flickered over her briefly. "I'll arrange a car for you."

He glanced at Evelyn. "Let's go." Without another word, he turned and strode away.

Evelyn frowned, about to follow, but Diana Hart blocked her path.

Diana smirked, tilting her head. "Running off with Daniel like that… Tell me, do you really think those two children are safe without protection?"

Evelyn turned, her expression icy. A cold laugh escaped her. "Did you miss what happened to Vivian Prescott?"

She studied Diana's paling face, her voice dripping with mockery. "Daniel already announced the divorce. If you dare lay a finger on Liam and Emily, you’ll only speed up the process."

With that, she walked away, leaving Diana seething. Evelyn knew Diana was just trying to provoke her.

If Diana truly wanted to harm the children, she wouldn’t have waited this long.

Standing at the hotel entrance, Diana watched Evelyn’s retreating figure, her eyes narrowing with malice.

She pulled out her phone and dialed. "They’re gone."

A shaky voice answered. "Ms. Vivian, are you sure this will work? Even if I resemble you, Daniel isn’t stupid!"

Diana scoffed. "Why do you think I’ve been spreading rumors about my plastic surgery addiction?"

To the public, Vivian Prescott was a woman obsessed with altering her appearance, looking different every day. With that reputation, even a passing resemblance would be enough to deceive him.

The Prescott family mansion loomed ahead, its grandeur undeniable.

Evelyn stepped out of the car, taking in the opulent estate.

As a native of Mariner’s Cove, she knew the Prescott family’s wealth. But standing before their home, she finally understood why Gregory Blackwood had once claimed Vivian was the only woman fit to marry Daniel.

The Prescott estate rivaled the Blackwood Estate in sheer extravagance.

"Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Carter."

The Prescott family butler greeted them, ushering them inside with practiced ease.

A young woman stood in the foyer.

Her face lit up when she saw them. "Daniel."

Daniel frowned. "Who are you?"

"I’m Vivian. Vivian Prescott."

The woman smiled hesitantly, touching her face. "I’ve changed a bit over the years. It’s no surprise you don’t recognize me."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

At first glance, the resemblance was uncanny. But upon closer inspection, the differences were stark.

The original Vivian had been sharp-eyed and haughty, a spoiled heiress with an air of arrogance.

This woman’s gaze was meek, almost fearful—like someone who had spent years cowering in the shadows.

While Evelyn was stunned, Daniel remained composed.

He shook Vivian’s hand, introduced Evelyn, then asked, "Where’s Mr. Prescott?"

"Father is preparing for your banquet."

Vivian checked the clock. "It’s 1 PM now. The event starts at 4. You two should eat and rest first."

Daniel paused. "Your family said the banquet was this afternoon."

"Yes."

Vivian smiled, guiding them toward the dining room. "Father arranged a late-night banquet. The afternoon one is my doing. Didn’t you say you wanted to see me?"

Daniel’s expression darkened. He sat in silence, his jaw tight.
###Chapter 346

"It appears Ms. Evelyn is quite exceptional, given how Mr. Blackwood insists on keeping you by his side at all times."

The conversation abruptly shifted toward her. Evelyn cleared her throat. "Mr. Blackwood simply wanted to provide me with more exposure."

"She's a designer."

Daniel spoke between elegant bites of his meal. "In the realm of jewelry design, she is indeed unparalleled."

Vivian's lips curled into a knowing smile. "It's easy to grow fond of those with talent."

Her gaze swept over Evelyn from head to toe. "If the opportunity arises, I'd love to introduce our designer to Ms. Evelyn. They could exchange insights."

Evelyn tensed, about to respond when she caught the venom in Vivian's stare.

The sheer hatred in those eyes sent a chill down her spine.

This was their first encounter—at least, as Evelyn.

So why did Vivian despise her so intensely?

The hostility radiating from her now was far more potent than what she'd displayed years ago, when she'd disrupted Evelyn and Daniel's wedding.

Soon, lunch concluded.

Evelyn and Daniel didn't linger at the Prescott estate. Daniel cited business obligations as they made their exit.

The moment they slid into the car, Daniel reclined against the seat, eyes shut. "Drop her at the mall. Take me back to the hotel."

Evelyn blinked.

"Why am I going to the mall?"

He didn't bother opening his eyes. "Do you honestly believe your current attire is suitable for a banquet?"

Instinctively, she glanced down at her white trousers and blouse.

...Not exactly.

"Purchase an appropriate gown. Make yourself presentable."

Ten minutes later, Evelyn found herself unceremoniously deposited at the mall entrance.

Daniel tossed her a black card. "No spending limit. Return it to me afterward."

The car door slammed shut, and the sleek black Maserati vanished down the road.

Evelyn stared after it, rolling her eyes before hailing a cab to head inside.

By 4 PM, the Prescott family's welcome banquet for Daniel was in full swing at Mariner's Cove's most luxurious five-star hotel.

Daniel arrived with Evelyn on his arm.

The moment they stepped into the grand hall, Mr. Prescott whisked Daniel away to mingle with business associates.

Left to her own devices, Evelyn wandered aimlessly through the glittering crowd.

Within moments, she spotted Diana.

Clad in a lavender gown, Diana stood at the center of the room, deep in conversation with Vivian.

Their familiarity was unmistakable.

Evelyn's brows furrowed.

Diana and Vivian knew each other?

One was a Willowbrook native who'd only recently returned from abroad.

The other was a reclusive, surgery-obsessed socialite from Mariner's Cove.

Since when were they acquainted?

Just as Evelyn's gaze lingered in shock, Diana suddenly looked up—directly at her.

Their eyes locked.

Evelyn flinched, hastily averting her gaze.

But Diana's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Evelyn?"

A sharp, unfamiliar voice cut through the air.

Evelyn turned toward the sound.

Before her stood a woman in a crimson ballgown—her high school desk mate, Gwen Donovan.

Evelyn froze.

Even if they'd been close back then, her name and appearance were entirely different now. How had Gwen recognized her?

As hesitation gripped her, Gwen's hand shot out—

Slap!

The sharp crack of skin meeting skin echoed through the hall as Gwen's palm struck Evelyn's cheek.
###Chapter 347

The sharp crack of Gwen's hand meeting Evelyn's cheek echoed through the grand ballroom.

Evelyn pressed a palm to her stinging skin, eyes wide with disbelief as she stared at her former classmate.

Gwen crossed her arms, lips curling in disdain. "I can't believe you have the audacity to show your face here!"

Her voice carried, drawing curious glances from nearby guests. "First, you wreck a marriage in Willowbrook, and now you parade yourself around Mariner's Cove like you own the place?"

The crowd murmured, clustering closer.

Gwen fed off their attention, chin lifting. "Did you forget Diana is from this city? Everyone here stands with her!"

Few recognized Daniel Blackwood's name in Mariner's Cove, but scandal traveled fast.

Whispers slithered through the room.

"Pretty face, rotten heart..."

"Homewrecker."

"Should've slapped her harder."

Evelyn's fingers twitched against her cheek.

She and Gwen hadn't spoken in over a decade—not since Evelyn left for university. Why this sudden crusade?

When Evelyn remained silent, Gwen's smirk widened. She raised her hand again—

Evelyn caught her wrist mid-air, grip iron-tight.

"Careful, Ms. Donovan," Evelyn said coolly. "Remember sophomore year? That fight you started over false rumors?"

Gwen froze.

How did this woman know about that?

Evelyn released her with a flick. "Facts before judgment. Surely you've learned that by now?"

Her tone was glacial, gaze sharper.

Gwen flushed, scrambling. "I—I don't know what happened in Willowbrook. But this invitation was for Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood." She jabbed a finger toward Evelyn. "Who are you to crash their event?"

The crowd buzzed anew.

If the Prescotts invited the Blackwoods... why was this woman here?

"Pathetic," Gwen sneered. "Trying to pass yourself off as his wife?"

Evelyn's lips curved. She produced an ivory card. "I'm the lead designer for Blackwood Group. Here on business." Her eyes hardened. "Not to endure your theatrics."

"Liar!" Gwen grabbed her arm, hauling her toward the entrance's guest display.

"See?" She stabbed at the board. "Only Daniel and Vivian Blackwood are listed. No Evelyn Carter!"

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

Vivian had personally requested her name for the roster at lunch.

Yet here, it was conspicuously absent.

Gwen crowed in triumph. "No excuses now, homewrecker!"
###Chapter 348

"Let's not forget they're still legally married. Even if they divorce, you'd never have a shot!"

With a flick of her wrist, Gwen signaled the security team. "Escort her out immediately."

"Hold on."

Evelyn's voice cut through the tension, prompting Diana to let out a mocking laugh.

She turned to Gwen with a raised brow. "Technically, you're right—I shouldn't be here if my name isn't on the guest list. But Ms. Donovan, this is a Prescott family event. Are you a Prescott?"

Gwen froze, lips pressed tight.

Evelyn didn't let up. "If anyone has the right to kick me out, it should be the Prescotts. Don't you agree?"

Gwen's face darkened. Just then, Vivian and Diana happened to stroll past.

Spotting them, Gwen seized the opportunity and rushed over, gripping Vivian's arm. "Miss Prescott! This woman crashed the banquet without an invitation!"

Vivian paused mid-step.

Beside her, Diana halted as well.

Clad in a soft lilac gown, Diana blinked in feigned surprise. "Ms. Carter? What are you—"

Her voice cracked, eyes welling up instantly. "I should've known better than to come. Even though Daniel and I are still married, it's clear he only has eyes for you now..."

She sniffled, setting down her wine glass before approaching Evelyn with a shallow bow. "I'm sorry. I assumed the Prescotts invited Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood, and since I'm still legally his wife, I thought... I didn't mean to intrude or upset you both."

Wiping her tears, she glanced at Gwen. "Gwen, don't blame Ms. Carter. It's my fault for clinging to the illusion that I'm still Daniel's wife. I'll leave—she should stay."

She turned to exit, but Gwen caught her wrist, shooting Evelyn a venomous glare. "Since when do mistresses get to act this entitled? Is there no justice left?"

Whispers erupted like wildfire.

"Disgusting. Homewreckers have no shame these days."

"Poor Mrs. Blackwood. A wife shouldn’t have to beg her husband’s mistress for mercy."

"Throw the mistress out!"

Amid the jeers, subtle shoves and glares were thrown Evelyn’s way.

She stood her ground, fists clenched.

Her gaze locked onto Vivian. "Ms. Prescott, care to explain?"

Evelyn pulled the invitation from her clutch. "You handed this to me personally. You even confirmed my name for the guest list. So why am I suddenly an unwelcome intruder?"

Vivian stiffened.

After a beat, she offered a strained smile. "Ah... must’ve been a miscommunication with the printing team."

She sighed. "The list is finalized now, Ms. Carter. Don’t overthink it—just enjoy the party."

"No."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a frosty smile.

This was a setup. Vivian and Diana had orchestrated this humiliation, using Gwen as their pawn.

She inhaled sharply and tore the invitation to pieces right in front of Vivian.

"If the Prescotts invite guests only to disrespect them, then this banquet isn’t worth my time."

She tossed the shredded paper into the air. "Now I see how Mariner’s Cove’s most powerful family treats their so-called 'honored' guests."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Destroying a Prescott invitation at their own event? Publicly calling them out?

This woman had nerves of steel.

Evelyn turned on her heel to leave—only for two broad-shouldered bodyguards to block her path.

Behind her, a voice laced with icy authority rang out.

"Do you have any idea what you’ve just done?"
###Chapter 349

Evelyn's brows knitted together as she spun around instinctively.

Behind her stood a middle-aged man leaning heavily on a cane, his sharp gaze burning with thinly veiled disdain. Beside him, Daniel remained motionless, his expression unreadable.

The man who had spoken was none other than Dennis Prescott—the patriarch of the Prescott family and Vivian's father.

When Evelyn turned to face him, Dennis let out a derisive snort. "In all my years, I've never witnessed such blatant disrespect toward the Prescott family at our own event!"

A faint smile curved Evelyn's lips.

She met his glare without flinching. "Mr. Prescott, you saw how I disrespected your family. But did you see how your family disrespected me first?"

With that, she gestured toward the guest list Gwen had used to humiliate her. "This afternoon, Ms. Prescott personally requested my name and handed me an invitation. I arrived here as the lead designer for Blackwood Enterprises. And now? Not only is my name missing, but Mrs. Blackwood's name appears instead. I was accused of impersonating her, yet Ms. Prescott claimed the list couldn't be altered and demanded I stay silent."

Her words struck like bullets—each one precise and damning.

The older man's frown deepened. "A simple error in a name is hardly worth this spectacle! Surely you don't expect an apology?"

"Uncle, don't I deserve one?"

The moment the words left her mouth, Daniel let out a cold laugh.

He stepped forward, his icy gaze sweeping over the gathered crowd. "The more prestigious the event, the more crucial the details. If Ms. Prescott were treated this way at my estate, would you remain so composed, Uncle?"

Dennis's expression flickered. "That's because our Vivian is a woman of refinement and status! This Evelyn is nobody!"

Evelyn's jaw tightened, but before she could respond, Daniel moved in front of her.

"As the director of this project, I have every right to demand justice for my employee. Don't you agree?"

His voice was steel. "Since you openly insult her knowing she works for me, I see no reason to continue our partnership."

He grasped Evelyn's hand and turned. "Consider my presence revoked."

With that, he strode toward the exit, pulling her along.

Her fingers curled slightly in his grip, an unexpected warmth blooming in her chest.

For all his flaws, in this moment, he stood by her when the entire room turned against her.

Even if it was just for show—she was grateful.

Seeing Daniel truly meant to leave, Dennis paled.

The public knew him as Willowbrook's wealthiest man, but few realized he was the shadowed head of the largest multinational corporation overseas.

Tonight's banquet was meant to forge ties between Prescott Group and Blackwood Enterprises—to pave the way for Prescott's global expansion.

And now…

Because of this petty dispute, Daniel was walking out?

Panicked, Dennis hobbled forward, blocking their path.

"My boy, you misunderstand! It's not that I disrespect your employee—I merely thought an apology could wait until after the event. Once we identify who made the oversight, they'll apologize to Ms. Carter properly!"
###Chapter 350

Daniel's lips curled into a smirk as his gaze flickered toward Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, this banquet was arranged specifically for Mr. Blackwood. Surely you wouldn't want to ruin the evening over something so trivial?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously.

She released Daniel's hand and leveled Dennis with an icy stare. "Was it me who ruined the atmosphere, or was it your family's blatant disrespect?"

The woman's unyielding demeanor made the old man's eyes flash with irritation.

Forcing a smile, Dennis inhaled sharply. "Since both Ms. Carter and Mr. Blackwood are so invested in this matter, I'll settle it immediately!"

With that, he shot Vivian a pointed look. "Vivian, when you finalized the guest list, did you include Ms. Carter's name?"

Vivian smiled sweetly. "I handed it over to Mr. Prescott as soon as it was done."

The butler, Mr. Prescott, was quickly summoned to the hall.

After hearing the situation, he chuckled lightly. "Ah, so Evelyn and Evelyn Carter are two different people."

Dennis frowned. "Explain."

The elderly butler remained composed. "Ms. Vivian's list included Mr. Daniel Blackwood's name, followed by 'Evelyn.' Everyone knows Mr. Blackwood's wife is Diana Hart—formerly Evelyn Carter. I assumed 'Evelyn' was a nickname, and her full name was Evelyn Carter. Since she was Mr. Blackwood's wife, I took the liberty of changing the entry to 'Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood.'"

His words sent murmurs rippling through the crowd.

Evelyn. Evelyn Carter.

The only difference was the missing surname.

Combined with Gwen Donovan's earlier insinuations that Evelyn had seduced Daniel…

"This woman is terrifying—she shares the same name Mrs. Blackwood used to go by!"

"I think she did it on purpose to lure Mr. Blackwood in…"

The whispers swirled around Evelyn like a relentless tide.

Her brows knitted together as she instinctively turned her gaze toward Diana, who stood at a distance.

Coincidentally, Diana was already watching her.

Their eyes locked.

Diana smirked and made a mocking gesture in Evelyn's direction.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

This was all part of Diana's scheme.

She had exploited the vulnerability in Evelyn's name and orchestrated this entire debacle.

Because of the similarity, Evelyn couldn't even refute the Prescott family's claim that it was all a misunderstanding.

"Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Carter."

The butler bowed slightly, his smile polite. "I acted on my own. This has nothing to do with Master Prescott or Ms. Vivian. My apologies for the inconvenience, Ms. Carter."

When he finished, Dennis chuckled lightly. "Ms. Carter, is this apology sufficient? Now that Mr. Prescott has made amends, is there anything else you're dissatisfied with?"
###Chapter 351

That half-hearted apology only drew a cold chuckle from Evelyn.

She took a deep breath before locking eyes with the butler, Mr. Prescott. "So you're claiming you only knew Mrs. Blackwood was once called Evelyn Carter, but had no clue another woman shared that name in this world? Is that correct?"

The butler's brow furrowed slightly as he remained silent.

"Obviously he wouldn't know!" Daniel scoffed sharply. "If he'd been aware Ms. Evelyn and Evelyn Carter were two separate people and still did this, it would mean he deliberately wanted to cause you trouble."

"Mr. Prescott has served as our butler for over two decades. He knows better than to pull such a stunt."

"I see." Evelyn inhaled deeply, her fingers subtly pressing the hidden button on her necklace.

A soft chime sounded before she continued, her voice light but edged. "So, according to old Mr. Prescott, if the butler knew from the start that Evelyn Carter and I are different people, then this was intentional, yes?"

Her words drained the color from the butler's face. His panicked gaze flickered toward Diana.

Diana's eyes narrowed. She stepped forward, gently grasping Evelyn's arm. "Ms. Evelyn, you're overreacting. The butler must be in his fifties or sixties—men his age often struggle with memory."

"Even if he'd heard your name before, he might've simply forgotten."

The butler stiffened, nodding frantically. "Yes, exactly! My memory isn't what it used to be!"

Evelyn's gaze turned icy as she withdrew her arm from Diana's hold. "His memory is failing, you say?"

Her attention shifted to Dennis. "As the wealthiest man in Mariner's Cove, why would old Mr. Prescott entrust household affairs to someone with such unreliable recall?"

The question hit like a stone shattering still water.

Every guest here had business ties to the Prescott family—most dealt directly with the butler. If his memory was truly compromised, what if he made similar "mistakes" with them?

The implications sent murmurs rippling through the crowd.

Voices rose, overlapping in hushed urgency until the hall buzzed with tension.

Daniel stood behind Evelyn, arms crossed, lips curled in a cold smirk.

Idiots.

Claiming the Prescott family butler was incompetent carried far graver consequences than merely omitting Evelyn's name.

His gaze lingered on Evelyn with quiet admiration.

As the murmurs swelled, Dennis's expression darkened. "Our butler's health and memory are impeccable!"

He turned a glare on Diana. "What gives you the right to spread rumors about our staff, Mrs. Blackwood? Since when do you speak for our household?"

The reprimand stunned Diana. Her father had never spoken to her like this.

Suppressing her fury, she dipped her head. "My mistake. I assumed Mr. Prescott was like my own aging parents—memory fading with time. Clearly, he's far sharper than ordinary people."

Evelyn's jaw tightened.

Though she held little affection for her parents, hearing Diana disparage them publicly left a bitter taste.

Dennis looked equally displeased.

On surface, Diana's words seemed complimentary—but they dripped with veiled mockery toward him.

He waved a dismissive hand. "Enough. The butler acted alone in his error and has apologized. There's nothing more to see. Everyone, return to your conversations."

If this continued, who knew what else might unravel?

"Wait."
###Chapter 352

Evelyn inhaled sharply as she stared at the email Oliver had sent to her phone.
The moment she'd activated her necklace's recording function, he'd heard everything from his end.
Her clever little brother had delivered the smoking gun.

With effortless grace, Evelyn stepped forward into the center of the gathering. "Mr. Prescott, might I borrow your projector?"

Within minutes, she'd synced her phone and opened the damning file.

"These are analytics tracing the online smear campaign against me in Willowbrook." Her manicured finger tapped the screen. "Every malicious post originated from an offshore content farm—registered under the butler's name."

The room erupted.

Dennis Prescott whirled toward his longtime servant in shock. The butler's eyes darted toward Diana Hart before he pressed his lips into a thin line.

Evelyn didn't miss the silent exchange.

"But—" Vivian Prescott finally spoke up, frowning. "Proxy companies take commissions anonymously. How does this prove he specifically targeted you?"

A slow smile curved Evelyn's lips. "An excellent question."

She swiped to the next exhibit.

"After identifying the connection, I tracked down their operations manager." Her stiletto clicked against marble as she circled the projector. "Let's hear what he had to say after... generous incentives."

The recording crackled to life.

"Double the workforce. I want Evelyn Carter buried under so much filth she'll never surface. Every post must pair her slander with praise for Mrs. Blackwood!"

The butler's unmistakable voice filled the ballroom.

Dennis looked ready to faint.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Still suffering from memory loss? Or was confusing my name with Diana's intentional?"

Truthfully, Oliver had uncovered the butler's involvement weeks ago. She'd merely waited for the perfect moment to spring the trap.

"I..." The butler's jaw worked silently until Diana suddenly burst into theatrical sobs.

"Uncle Prescott!" She clutched her pearls. "Why would you fabricate an affair between Evelyn and Daniel?"
###Chapter 353

The butler was far from being a harmless, naive old man.

His expression darkened at Evelyn's words. "Ms. Carter, I didn't do any of this for you. I did it for my daughter, Vanessa! She's your closest friend, and if you're miserable because of this woman, she'll be devastated too."

"As her father, how could I stand by and watch my daughter drown in sorrow every day?" His glare turned icy as it landed on Diana. A cruel smirk twisted his lips. "And this woman—she's been using work as a cover to stay close to Mr. Blackwood while secretly scheming against him! Shouldn't the world know the truth about a homewrecker like her?"

The venom in his voice wasn't just hatred for a mistress—it was personal.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed.

A cold laugh escaped her lips. "How touching. The Prescott family's butler cares more about their affairs than his own duties. Anyone watching might mistake Diana for your real daughter instead of just your daughter's friend!"

The butler scoffed. "To me, Diana is family!"

"Enough!" Diana wiped her tears and tugged at his sleeve. "I know you and Vanessa mean well, but you've got it all wrong..."

She turned toward Daniel, slipping her arm through his with practiced ease. "Daniel and I have always been inseparable. We have two beautiful children—a son and a daughter. Six years ago, I left Willowbrook, and he waited for me all this time."

"Not only that, but he even looked after my sister and my family in my absence. How could anyone come between us after everything we've been through?"

"Besides, Evelyn has only worked at Blackwood Group for a month. I trust Daniel—he would never throw away six years for someone he barely knows."

She leaned into his chest. Daniel stiffened at first, but her words struck a chord. His resistance faded, and his arms wrapped around her—almost instinctively.

Evelyn watched, her chest tightening with every second.

Gwen, standing nearby, couldn't hold back any longer. "Diana, stop defending him! He announced his divorce in front of everyone. Was that a lie? He's spineless and disloyal. He doesn't deserve your loyalty!"

The murmurs in the banquet hall grew louder.

"Gwen, please," Diana said, pulling away from Daniel with a shaky breath. "The truth is—"

"The truth is, the butler and Vanessa orchestrated everything, but Diana chose to take the blame for them," Daniel cut in coldly, pulling her back against him. "I only mentioned divorce in the heat of the moment."

His sharp gaze shifted to the butler, then to Dennis. "Uncle, the butler works for you."

Dennis's frown deepened.

He shot the butler a withering glare. "How dare you scheme behind my back to slander Evelyn in Willowbrook? Because of you, people almost believed my nephew was some kind of heartless scum. Apologize to him. Now."

The butler scrambled forward. "Mr. Blackwood, I—I'm sorry..."
###Chapter 354

Daniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "The apology should be directed at her."

The butler hesitated, then shuffled toward Evelyn with reluctant steps.

"Ms. Carter, I—"

"Save it." Evelyn lifted her chin, her frosty eyes raking over the butler's weathered face. "Do you honestly expect me to believe you acted alone? That the rumors, the slander, the humiliation—all of it was your idea?"

"Of course." The butler met her stare. "Who else could it be?"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. She didn't dignify his question with an answer, nor did she accept his half-hearted apology. Instead, her gaze drifted past him, landing on Daniel, who stood across the room with Diana wrapped in his arms.

"If Mr. Blackwood has chosen to drop the matter, then so be it." Her voice was ice. "But I won't stay where I'm not wanted. Consider my presence at this banquet revoked."

Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and strode toward the exit, the whispers of the crowd fading behind her.

Evelyn didn’t understand why her chest ached. She was the wronged party, the one vindicated in the end—yet she felt like a fool. A coward.

The image of Daniel holding Diana, lying for her, defending her—it burned behind Evelyn’s eyelids.

Her steps quickened, the sharp click of her heels echoing through the grand hall.

Daniel remained rooted in place, watching her retreating figure. A strange pang twisted in his chest, sharp and unexpected.

"Daniel."

When the spectacle finally ended and the guests dispersed, Diana carefully disentangled herself from his embrace.

She bit her lip, eyes wide and pleading. "Thank you for standing up for me. I know you were just trying to protect me. I won’t read too much into it..."

Daniel exhaled slowly, his fingers brushing against her cheek—the face he had missed for six long years. "You're right. We shouldn’t throw away everything we’ve built over a woman I’ve known for barely a month."

He leaned in, his grip firm on her shoulders. Though his touch was cool, his gaze was unwavering. "Let’s move forward. I won’t revisit this, and neither will Evelyn. But trust me, Diana. If you ever pull something like this again—"

His voice dropped to a warning. "I won’t shield you."

With that, he released her and turned away, heading upstairs to find Dennis.

Diana stood frozen, her fingers lingering where his hands had been. A rush of triumph surged through her.

She had won.

Six years of devotion hadn’t been erased in a few short weeks.

Her eyes flicked upward, landing on Dennis, deep in conversation with Daniel over drinks. A smirk curled her lips as she pulled out her phone and typed a quick message.

[Get him drunk.]

Tonight, she would seal her victory.
The celebration lasted until dawn's first light.

Though Daniel Blackwood had visited Mariner's Cove before, the locals greeted him with unprecedented warmth this time. They formed queues just to clink glasses with him, and he matched them drink for drink...

Eventually, he slumped over, barely conscious, slurring only Evelyn Carter's name repeatedly until Ethan Reynolds hauled him back to the Starlight Grand Hotel.

"I've got him." Ethan maneuvered the intoxicated man into the suite. Diana Hart trailed behind, murmuring, "You've had a long night. Thank you."

As Ethan lowered Daniel onto the king-sized bed, his brow furrowed. "Mrs. Blackwood, perhaps I should tend to him? During those six years you were... away, I handled all his drunken episodes. You should rest."

He moved toward the bathroom to dampen a towel.

The instant the faucet hissed to life, Diana's fingers closed around his wrist.

Her lips curved in a practiced smile. "Let me. Didn't you witness our reconciliation tonight? It's time I embraced my wifely duties." She tilted her head toward the bedroom, where Daniel's drunken murmurs continued. "Besides... he's calling for me by that old name."

Ethan hesitated before exhaling. "Very well."

After briefing her on essential care steps, he departed, the suite door clicking shut behind him.

Now alone in the lavish penthouse, Diana secured the deadbolt with a satisfied smirk. She approached the bed where Daniel thrashed, still chanting Evelyn's name.

"Daniel Blackwood... After all this time, you're finally mine."

A delighted laugh escaped her as she pivoted toward the marble bathroom.

Tonight demanded perfection. She'd soak in rose-infused waters to commemorate this pivotal moment.

Before entering, she swallowed a fertility pill from her clutch. Though not her optimal cycle, this opportunity couldn't be wasted.

A pregnancy would cement her position. Even if the truth surfaced later, Daniel's notorious soft spot for children would guarantee his forgiveness.

The thought sent pleasurable shivers down her spine.

Humming, she sank into the bubbling tub, envisioning her future as Mrs. Blackwood. There was ample time to prepare before making her move. The pills needed time to take effect anyway.

Outside, the supposedly comatose man stirred.

"Water..." Daniel's groping hand found no glass on the nightstand. Staggering upright, he swayed toward the door.

Blind drunk, he ricocheted off walls until reaching the adjacent suite.

Fists pounded against mahogany. "Open up! Now!"

Inside, Evelyn Carter paused her video call with Oliver Carter mid-sentence. The insistent banging intensified, accompanied by increasingly frantic demands.

"Mom, you should check," Oliver's pixelated image advised. "Sounds like he's completely wasted."
###Chapter 356

The phone call ended with Oliver’s sweet, obedient voice. "We'll talk when you're free!"

Then, the line went dead.

Evelyn had no choice but to walk to the door and open it.

The moment she did, the man barged in, reeking of alcohol. Stumbling, he collapsed onto her bed in a drunken heap. "Honey... I need water..."

The endearment froze Evelyn where she stood, her grip tightening on the door handle.

He had never called her that before.

It was something she’d once scribbled in her diary—a foolish, youthful dream. And now, six years later, it was happening—while he was too drunk to even know what he was saying.

"Water..." he mumbled again, sprawled across her sheets.

Sighing, she shut the door and poured him a glass, warming it slightly before returning.

"Here." She held it out.

Daniel nodded, pushing himself up against the headboard. He drained the glass in one go before flopping back down, fingers clumsily tugging at his tie.

The formal banquet had demanded a suit, but now the tie seemed to suffocate him.

Evelyn exhaled, stepping closer. She bent down, fingers working deftly to loosen the knot before setting it aside. Then, she undid the top buttons of his shirt, trying to make him more comfortable.

But as she reached for the second button, his hands suddenly locked around her waist.

"Honey... Evelyn Carter..."

His voice was rough, drunk, desperate.

Before she could react, he yanked her down against his chest. "I’ve missed you..."

She stiffened, struggling instinctively—but his grip was iron.

Defeated, she stopped fighting, letting herself sink into him. His heartbeat was steady beneath her ear, his breath warm against her hair.

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Daniel... which version of you is real?"

The cruel man from six years ago?

Or this one, whispering sweet nothings while drowning in alcohol?

One moment, he swore he’d divorce Diana. The next, he claimed Diana was innocent—that it was all a lie.

Which words were true?

Which were just drunken ramblings?

Next door, Diana finally stepped out of the shower, humming as she towel-dried her hair.

The suite was empty.

The door hung wide open.

And Daniel was gone.

"Damn it!" She stomped her foot, hastily throwing on clothes before snatching up the phone. "Security! I need the CCTV footage for this floor—now!"

Dressed, she stormed out, heading straight for the surveillance room.

The staff scrambled to pull up the recordings.

"Here," one finally said, pointing at the screen. "Mr. Blackwood left your suite... and went into the room next door."

Diana’s eyes narrowed. "Who’s staying there?"

The manager checked the registry. "A woman named Evelyn Carter. She’s his employee." He hesitated. "What would you like to do?"

Her jaw clenched.

"What else?" she hissed. "Get him back."
###Chapter 357

Daniel held Evelyn in a tight embrace that seemed to last forever.

His eyelids grew heavy, the warmth of her body lulling him toward sleep. Just as he began drifting off, he jolted awake—this wasn't his room.

After lingering too long in her bed, he pushed himself up unsteadily. His legs wobbled as he tried to stand.

Evelyn watched his struggle, her resolve crumbling.

She exhaled sharply, then slid under his arm to support him. Together, they shuffled toward the door. The one beside hers still stood open.

Of course. He'd been too out of it to close it.

She guided him inside, shut the door behind them, and went to fetch water. His dry throat must have driven him to her room in the first place.

Glass placed on the nightstand, she pulled the covers over him and turned to leave.

His hand shot out, catching her wrist.

A low chuckle rumbled from him as he flipped her beneath him. "Sweetheart, you're home now. Why leave?"

Evelyn froze, but his lips were already tracing paths across her skin.

Meanwhile, Diana stormed down the hallway with Jonas Donovan at her heels. She pounded on Evelyn's door, voice shrill.

"Evelyn! Get out here! You hypocrite—first you refuse to be the other woman, now you're stealing my fiancé?"

Her fist hammered against the wood. "Open this door!"

Tonight was supposed to be hers.

Every detail had been planned. She wouldn't let some upstart ruin everything.

Jonas frowned, pulling out his phone to call security.

"Ms. Prescott, this is pointless." He sighed after hanging up. "They just confirmed—she already took Mr. Blackwood back to his room."

Diana's jaw clenched. She whirled toward Daniel's suite, fist raised to knock—until the voices inside stopped her cold.

"Evelyn Carter...my Evelyn. God, I've missed you...just let me hold you..."

"Daniel, stop! You're not thinking straight!"

"I know exactly what I'm doing."

The raw hunger in his tone made Diana's nails bite into her palms. She moved to interrupt when Jonas caught her arm.

"Bad timing," he murmured. "You said it yourself—he's never looked at you the way he looks at her. But if he's drunk..." A meaningful pause. "He won't remember who was in his bed come morning. As long as it's you when he wakes up..."

Jonas cleared his throat. "Besides, a woman of your status shouldn't settle for being someone's second choice, should she?"

Diana's face darkened.

The jab stung, but the truth beneath it stung more.

She was Vivian Prescott—heiress, socialite, crown jewel of high society. No one's consolation prize.

With a derisive sniff, she lowered her hand. "Keep watch. Alert me the moment she leaves."

Jonas dipped his head. "Of course, ma'am."
###Chapter 358

That night, Daniel Blackwood dreamed vividly of Evelyn Carter returning to him. In the dream, she tenderly offered him water and responded sweetly whenever he called her "Darling."

They even...

Every time he whispered "Evelyn Carter," she answered naturally—not with Diana Hart's forced, awkward replies, but with effortless familiarity.

When he finally opened his eyes, the opulent hotel room greeted him. The plush bed wasn't empty—Diana lay curled against him, clad only in lace, her breathing soft.

Scattered clothes and crumpled tissues littered the floor.

Daniel pressed his fingers to his temples. The evidence was undeniable.

Had last night truly happened?

"You're awake?" Diana stirred, blinking sleepily. Her lashes fluttered as she gazed up at him. "You were... intense last night."

He exhaled sharply, then pulled her onto his lap. "I was happy."

Not a dream, then. The way she moved, the way she responded—it had all felt achingly familiar.

"I was happy too," Diana murmured, nuzzling his chest. But he missed the venom in her eyes.

Last night...

In the adjacent room, Evelyn still slept, exhausted. Daniel had been relentless, demanding she answer to "Evelyn Carter," insisting she call him "Darling."

The more she obeyed, the rougher he became.

She barely made it back to her own bed before collapsing.

At 8 AM, her doorbell chimed.

Groggy, she shuffled to the entrance. "Who is it?"

"Us." Diana stood there, radiant in fresh clothes, a saccharine smile on her lips. "Daniel and I just had breakfast. We brought you something."

Evelyn's gaze flickered past her to Daniel, impeccably dressed, holding two takeout bags. His expression was unreadable.

Her chest tightened—anger or pain, she couldn't tell.

She accepted the food with a cold laugh. "Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood seem... refreshed."

Diana beamed. "We reconciled last night. He wouldn’t even let me fetch breakfast alone this morning."

Her smile turned saccharine. "We're blissful, Evelyn. I hope you and Theodore find the same happiness."

Evelyn's eyes locked onto Daniel's impassive face.

He stood there, indifferent, scrolling through his phone.

Her fingers clenched around the bag. "May your joy last as long as last night did."

She slammed the door.

Diana's petulant voice carried through the wood. "I was being kind! Why is she so bitter?"

Daniel's reply was ice. "Forget her."

Evelyn leaned against the door, hand pressed to her aching heart.

After everything they'd shared last night, he could stand there—cold, detached, playing the doting husband.

Did the man even have a soul?
###Chapter 359

Evelyn and Daniel had planned to tour several jewelry manufacturers in Mariner's Cove that day for market research.

Their meeting time was set for 9am sharp, but by 10:30am, Daniel still hadn't shown up.

Sitting alone in her hotel room, Evelyn debated whether to confront him. If they weren't going, she could stop waiting.

"Daniel, thank you for staying with me today, but the pain isn't so bad now." Just as Evelyn raised her hand to knock, Diana's honeyed voice floated through the door. "Didn't you come to Mariner's Cove for business? You should go."

"I'll cancel everything," came Daniel's velvet voice, dripping with tenderness. "Where does it still hurt? Let me massage it for you."

"Right here...it's all your fault last night..." "Shh, I'll make it better."

One voice was saccharine and coaxing, the other deep and indulgent.

Evelyn's poised fist froze mid-air. After a long moment, she snorted and turned away.

At the elevator bank, she nearly collided with Ethan stepping out.

"Ms. Carter," Ethan stopped her. "The CEO asked me to inform you - the factory visits are postponed until tomorrow. Several owners aren't prepared to receive us. You're free to explore the city today."

Evelyn's lips curled bitterly. "Of course."

Were the manufacturers truly unprepared? Or was Daniel simply choosing to pamper Diana instead?

She didn't know. She didn't care to find out.

Evelyn wandered Mariner's Cove's streets aimlessly.

She'd lived here over a decade before leaving abruptly because of Daniel. Now she'd returned with him...only to watch him cradle another woman.

The irony tasted like ashes.

She visited every landmark of her youth - Seaview Preparatory, the junior high, her favorite café, the park bench where she'd first sketched jewelry designs.

Her phone stayed off all day. Only at 10pm did she finally hail a cab back to Starlight Grand Hotel.

Sliding her keycard, she froze upon seeing lights blazing in her suite. Daniel sat on her sofa, documents in hand.

"Mr. Blackwood," she held the door open pointedly. "Don't you have your own room? It's late. Wouldn't want to start rumors."

Daniel's mouth quirked coldly. He set down his files with deliberate slowness. "I needed to speak with you. You vanished all day."

"Diana's asleep. I didn't want to wake her, so I waited here."

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "How considerate. Since your wife is sleeping, you should join her. We'll talk business tomorrow...after she's awake."

Her dismissal hung between them like a guillotine. Daniel's jaw tightened.

"Close. The. Door."
###Chapter 360

"Evelyn knew I came to see you."

Serena scoffed and shut the door. "Not long ago, Mrs. Blackwood was still calling me your mistress. Since when did she become so generous?"

Daniel's expression darkened, but he didn't respond.

He gestured for her to sit on the sofa. "Due to unforeseen circumstances, the factory visits have been moved to tomorrow."

He handed her a stack of files. "These are the key factories. Study the designs and required materials. Tomorrow, pay close attention to what they provide. And—"

He slid another document toward her. "Memorize the design styles and target demographics of these companies."

Seeing his focus shift entirely to business, Evelyn decided to drop the personal matters. She scanned the documents carefully, marking sections that needed extra attention. "Got it."

"We leave at 9 AM sharp. We need to cover all these locations by the end of the day." His tone was clipped, devoid of warmth. "Dinner with a client in Mariner's Cove is scheduled for the evening. Don’t forget to bring something to counteract alcohol."

"Understood."

Evelyn kept her head down, flipping through the pages. "Anything else?" she asked absently.

"Yes." The man across from her shifted, his gaze piercing. "You've been to Mariner's Cove before, haven’t you?"

Her fingers stilled.

A beat later, she forced a smile. "I’ve been abroad my whole life. Didn’t you check my records?"

"So this is your first time here?"

She neatly stacked the documents. "Obviously."

Daniel draped an arm over the back of the sofa, his posture deceptively casual. "Yet you navigated the entire city in one afternoon like you’d lived here for years."

His words made her freeze.

Her head snapped up. "You had me followed?"

He didn’t deny it. "The way you moved through the streets—it was like you knew every corner."

After the banquet incident, he’d ordered Ethan and two other guards to trail her discreetly. He couldn’t risk another public attack like in Willowbrook.

But the footage they sent showed something unexpected—Evelyn, moving through Mariner’s Cove with unsettling familiarity.

"I was just exploring." She fought to keep her voice steady. "I studied a map last night. That’s all."

She lowered her gaze, pretending to focus on the documents again. "This is my first time here."

Daniel said nothing, his silence heavy.

She didn’t dare look up, unsure if he believed her.

The tension between them thickened.

Finally, he spoke, his voice low and dangerous. "Evelyn, what else are you hiding?"

She pressed her lips together before meeting his eyes with a tight smile. "What exactly are you implying, Mr. Blackwood? Still doubting whether I’ve been here before?"

"Partly." His lips curved, but his eyes remained cold. "Last night at the banquet, the documents you presented were sent from Ausland, correct?" His stare burned into her. "From that hacker friend of yours?"

Her breath hitched.

She couldn’t form a response.

"The timestamp showed he only started gathering the intel after you contacted him." His gaze dropped to the necklace around her throat. "You, Sophia, and Liam all wear the same one. Take it off. I want to examine it."
###Chapter 361

Evelyn froze. She never expected Daniel to notice her necklace. She had been so careful, avoiding any interaction with it when he was nearby.

Last night, she had activated the microphone so Oliver could listen in during the cocktail party. She never imagined Daniel would catch on and grow suspicious of the jewelry she wore.

Daniel knew he was right the moment he saw the shock in Evelyn’s eyes. His gaze sharpened as he studied her.

He had watched her every move the previous night—she hadn’t touched her phone once. So how had she communicated with the hacker?

Curious, he’d reviewed the surveillance footage. The only suspicious moment was when Evelyn briefly adjusted her necklace. That was enough to convince him it wasn’t just an ordinary piece of jewelry.

When he saw her hesitation, he reached for the necklace. But Evelyn snapped out of her daze and pressed both hands protectively against her chest. "Don’t touch me!"

She scrambled off the couch, putting distance between them, her fingers still clutching the necklace. "This belongs to me, Liam, and Sophia. You have no right to take it!"

Daniel stood and closed the gap between them with deliberate steps. The closer he got, the darker his expression became. "If it’s just a necklace, why can’t I look at it? I’m not stealing it. I just want to see."

Evelyn backed away frantically, her heart pounding. If he discovered its true function, he’d uncover Oliver’s existence.

Her back hit the door, trapping her. Daniel braced his arms on either side of her, caging her in. There was no escape.

His piercing gaze locked onto hers. "What are you so afraid of?"

His breath brushed her skin. She bit her lip, forcing herself to meet his eyes. "I’m not afraid."

She lifted her chin defiantly. "I just don’t want someone like you touching my things!"

Daniel’s eyes narrowed. "Someone like me?" He tilted her chin up, forcing her to hold his gaze. "What does that mean? What kind of person do you think I am?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She wanted to say so much but held back, turning her face away. "You already know the answer."

Did he really need her to spell out all his wrongdoings?

A cold laugh escaped him as he leaned in, his lips nearly brushing her ear. "Is it because you think I’m a hypocrite? Because I planned to divorce Diana but changed my mind?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "Isn’t that the truth?"

"Diana is my wife." His voice was icy. "She gave up everything to marry me. For three years, she endured hardships, even when my family treated her horribly. She fought to have my child, nearly dying in the process."

Evelyn stiffened. So he knew. He knew every sacrifice she had made for him.

A bitter smile curved her lips. "Is that why you changed your mind? Because of what happened years ago?"

"Yes." His voice was heavy. "I can never repay her for what she went through."
###Chapter 362

Evelyn Carter closed her eyes and let out a bitter laugh. If she didn't know him so well, she might have actually believed his act—the devoted, loving husband. But she did know him.

Too well.

If it weren’t for him, she wouldn’t have ended up in that accident.

If it weren’t for him, Serena Hart wouldn’t have gotten pregnant with his child and stayed by his side all these years.

If he was truly so devoted, why had he publicly announced his intention to divorce Diana? And now, suddenly, he was spinning tales, dragging up everything his supposed wife, Evelyn Carter, had endured?

This deceitful, two-faced man made her sick.

Just as the thought crossed her mind, a sharp pain shot up her neck. The next thing she saw was Daniel Blackwood dangling the necklace in front of her face, a smug smirk playing on his lips.

"Just as I thought."

There was a microchip embedded in the pendant, along with a tiny switch. Daniel toyed with it, his gaze sharp. "Is this how you contact that elusive hacker? Liam and Sophia both have identical necklaces. Do all four of you communicate through these?"

His eyes narrowed. Whoever was behind this was skilled—not just as a hacker, but in maintaining secrecy. Evelyn, Liam, and Sophia were all protecting this person’s identity.

Who was it?

Nathan Pierce? Unlikely.

Daniel knew his biggest competitor inside and out. Nathan wasn’t this good with technology.

"Give it back!" Evelyn lunged at him like a woman possessed, but Daniel sidestepped her effortlessly.

"Tell me who it is, and I’ll return it."

She gritted her teeth and tried again, throwing herself against him, her hands clawing at his arm. In her desperation, she didn’t realize how close they were—her fingers brushing against his belt buckle, her body pressed too intimately against his.

Daniel stiffened. His voice dropped to a dangerous growl. "Get your hands off me."

Evelyn bit her lip, glancing at the necklace before reluctantly releasing his arm.

His frown deepened. "The other one."

She froze, then looked down—her other hand was still gripping his belt. Heat flooded her cheeks as she jerked away. "Just give it back!"

Daniel exhaled sharply, studying the tiny switch. "If I press this now… will I finally get to meet your mysterious friend?"
###Chapter 363

"Daniel Blackwood!" Evelyn Carter's eyes burned with fury. "Don't push me to despise you!"

Daniel's fingers tightened around the necklace.

The raw pain in her gaze made him hesitate—but only for a second. His lips curled into a cold smirk.

All he wanted was to uncover the identity of the hacker who had been aiding her. He wasn’t planning to harm them. Why would she react like this?

His thumb pressed the button.

A sweet, childish voice immediately filled the room. "Mommy! If you ever feel sad, just remember—Sophia loves you! Liam and I recorded our voices so you’ll never feel alone."

Then, a calmer, more mature voice followed. "Even though we’re not with you right now, you have to take care of yourself. You trust people too easily, and I worry someone might take advantage of that. Eat on time. Sleep on time. Don’t neglect your health just because we’re not there to remind you."

Finally, both voices chimed together. "Mommy, we love you!"

Silence.

Then, the recording looped. "Mommy! If you ever feel sad—"

Daniel froze. His grip loosened, shame creeping into his expression. "This is…"

"Happy now?" Evelyn's voice cracked as tears spilled down her cheeks. She snatched the necklace back, clutching it like a lifeline. "I raised Liam and Sophia for six years. You tore us apart, and now you want to take the only thing I have left of them?"

Daniel’s gaze dropped. The woman before him—usually so composed—was trembling, her tears staining the carpet beneath them.

"I… didn’t know." For the first time, regret laced his words.

Maybe she had touched the necklace last night just to hear their voices. Not to contact some mysterious hacker. He had misjudged her completely.

His jaw clenched. "I thought this was—"

"I don’t know what hacker you’re talking about," Evelyn cut in bitterly. "This necklace is priceless to me because it’s the last connection I have to my children. If you must know who gave it to me—it was Liam. But you’d never believe that, would you?"

Daniel scoffed. "That’s impossible. How could Liam even—"

"Do you even know your son?" Evelyn’s voice turned sharp. "Liam and Sophia have been back at Silvercrest Manor for months. Have you ever bothered to learn what they love? What they’re capable of?"

She didn’t give him time to answer. "Your father was the one who discovered Sophia’s talent for jewelry design. But Liam? Do you have any idea what he excels at? Or do you spend all your time obsessing over Diana instead?"

Her laugh was hollow. "You’re a terrible father. And Diana? She’s just as unfit to be a mother. I suppose you two do deserve each other."

With that, she reached past him and yanked the door open. "It’s late, Mr. Blackwood. Shouldn’t you be rushing home to your wife?"

Daniel’s expression darkened at her icy tone. His eyes locked onto hers, unreadable. "Evelyn."
###Chapter 364

"Even if you mentioned Liam and Emily, don't forget—right now, you're just a designer at Blackwood Group." Daniel's voice was ice-cold, his gaze sharp as steel. "You have no right to interfere in my personal life, let alone how I raise my children."

He turned away before she could respond. "I apologize for earlier. I crossed a line. But don't presume to lecture me on parenting."

With that, he strode out, leaving Evelyn standing frozen by the door. She watched his retreating figure until he disappeared into his suite, the door clicking shut behind him. A bitter scoff escaped her lips.

Inside his room, Daniel didn’t head straight to bed. Ethan had booked him a presidential suite, complete with a private study. Instead of sleeping, he sat at the desk, pulling up files on his laptop.

Meanwhile, Diana lay sprawled across her bed, scrolling through her phone with a smirk. The hotel Evelyn and Daniel were staying at? Owned by the Prescotts. Officially, it wasn’t public knowledge, but the family held all the strings.

Before Evelyn’s arrival, Diana had ordered the manager to plant hidden cameras in her room. Now, she flicked through the images they’d captured.

Each photo was more damning than the last. Daniel staring at Evelyn’s chest. Him pinning her against the door, her hands clutching her blouse. And then—his fingers brushing toward her…

Jealousy twisted Diana’s stomach. She saved every photo, her nails digging into her palm. "What’s she doing now?"

"Looks like she’s grabbing a towel. Probably heading to shower."

Diana’s lips curled. "You put cameras in the bathroom too, right?"

"Of course."

"Good." Her voice dripped venom. "Take pictures. Then leak them online—under her name."

Let’s see how Evelyn Carter survives the scandal.

Evelyn had just stepped into the bathroom when Grace’s tearful call came through. "Evelyn, I don’t know what to do!"

Frowning, Evelyn paused with one hand on her shirt buttons. "What happened?"

"Benjamin got into a fight. We were on a weekend trip, checked into this cheap hotel—but something felt off. I Googled how to check for hidden cameras… and found three in our room!" Grace’s voice shook. "Benjamin lost it. He confronted the owner, and now—"

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone. "Did you call the police?"

"They’re on their way, but it’s some rural town. It’ll take forever, and Benjamin’s getting beaten—"

"Send me your location." Evelyn was already dialing Tyler and Dominic. "I’ve got people who can help."

Within minutes, Tyler confirmed their contacts nearby. "Consider it handled."

Half an hour later, Grace called back, relief clear in her voice. "Police finally showed up. Benjamin’s at the clinic now. God, Evelyn, if I hadn’t checked for cameras—who knows what they’d have filmed?"

Evelyn exhaled, murmuring reassurances as she finally stepped toward the shower. Then—her reflection in the mirror caught her eye.

"Grace," she said slowly. "How exactly did you find those cameras?"
###Chapter 365

Evelyn Carter followed Grace Thornton's instructions and discovered the hidden cameras in her room. There weren't just one or two—they were everywhere.

Above the showerhead. Embedded in the bathroom mirror. Perched atop the television. Concealed within the coffee table. And countless other places she hadn’t even noticed at first glance.

By the time she finished searching, Evelyn had collected more than ten devices. She placed them all on the coffee table, snapped photos for evidence, and then dialed the police.

The moment she ended the call, a sharp knock echoed at her door.

Evelyn frowned. "Who is it?"

A hesitant voice answered from the other side. "Ms. Carter? I'm the owner of this hotel. Andrew Donovan."

Evelyn stilled.

Andrew Donovan.

She knew that name.

Years ago, when she attended Seaview Preparatory with Gwen Donovan, she remembered Gwen mentioning her family owned a hotel. She just never expected it to be the one she was staying in now.

Evelyn didn’t need to guess why Andrew was here. She quickly set up her backup phone on the couch, discreetly activating the recording function before opening the door.

Andrew stood outside with Gwen and a man Evelyn didn’t recognize—though something about him felt oddly familiar.

The moment the door opened, Andrew plastered on a smile. "Ms. Carter, I apologize for the intrusion. We received reports that someone planted hidden cameras in our hotel without our knowledge. My daughter and son-in-law are helping me inspect every room. Would you mind if we took a quick look?"

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile.

Someone planted cameras without their knowledge?

What a laughable excuse.

She leaned against the couch, arms crossed. "No need. I’ve already found them." She gestured to the pile of devices on the table. "The police are on their way. So are the reporters. We’ll soon find out if this was an accident… or something far more deliberate."

Andrew paled.

Gwen’s face twisted in irritation. "Evelyn, stop blowing this out of proportion! My father already told you—we had nothing to do with this! Someone’s trying to sabotage us!"

She scoffed, eyes narrowing. "Or maybe you planted them yourself. Still bitter about last night’s cocktail party, aren’t you? You’re just trying to frame us!"

Andrew shot her a warning look. "Gwen, that’s enough."

But Gwen wasn’t done. "Am I wrong? You’re nothing but a husband-stealing bitch! Diana was my best friend, and anyone who hurts her is my enemy!"

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh. "Seems like my words last night didn’t sink in at all."

Gwen froze.

Last night, Evelyn had mentioned an incident from high school—one Gwen had never told anyone about.

"How… how did you know about that?" Gwen demanded.

Evelyn smirked. "Oh, I know more than just that." Her gaze flicked to the man behind Gwen. "I also know your husband was in the class next to ours in high school."

Recognition flashed in Evelyn’s eyes.

She had seen him before.

Back then, Gwen had been infatuated with him—but he hadn’t been as innocent as he pretended.

"Gwen," Evelyn said slowly, "there’s something you don’t know. Your husband had a crush on me in high school. But I turned him down because I knew you liked him." She tilted her head. "Isn’t that right, Benjamin?"

Benjamin Zeller didn’t answer.

But the way his gaze darted away said everything.

Gwen’s face darkened. She whirled on him. "Ben? Is this true?"

Silence.

Then—

SMACK.

Gwen’s palm struck his cheek with a sharp crack. "You lied to me?! You told me you loved me since high school!"

Benjamin flinched but said nothing.

And in that moment, Evelyn knew—

The real chaos had only just begun.
###Chapter 366

Benjamin remained silent for a long moment before finally mumbling, "Back at Seaview Preparatory, you weren't as stunning as Evelyn Carter..."

"You're mistaken." Serena crossed her arms defiantly. "Grace was absolutely charming in high school. And even if she wasn't as beautiful as Evelyn, you didn't need to lie about it."

Grace's temper flared instantly. She grabbed her husband's arm and yanked him into the hallway, their heated argument echoing through the corridor. The door slammed shut, leaving only Serena and Andrew inside the room.

"Mr. Donovan," Serena said with a sly smile, "I could choose not to escalate this situation or leak it to the media... but only if you meet one condition."

Andrew hesitated. "What condition?"

Outside, Grace's furious voice grew louder. "Why didn't you tell me you had feelings for Evelyn Carter? Serena even tried to warn me away from you! We fought over this! Now I understand - she wanted to protect me because she knew you'd break my heart! You pretended to like me when you were actually using me to get closer to her!"

The commotion seeped under the door into Diana and Daniel's room. They sat facing each other on the sofa, quietly eating the meal Ethan had brought them.

Hearing the argument, Daniel smirked and glanced at Diana. "Aren't you curious about what's happening out there?"

He expected her to show interest since they were discussing her supposed past. But Diana's face paled. She kept her head down, focusing on her food. Tightening her lips, she murmured, "I don't want to complicate things further."

Truthfully, she avoided the situation because she wanted no connection to Evelyn's friends. The risk of exposure terrified her. Without knowing Evelyn or Grace's history, intervening might reveal her deception to Daniel.

Diana continued eating silently, praying the arguing couple would leave soon.

Why were they dredging up high school drama now, right outside her door?

Daniel raised an eyebrow. "Your friend defended you last night. Why won't you help her now? Did you two have a falling out?"

Diana pressed her lips together. "Not exactly. I just think it's inappropriate to interfere in their personal matters..."

"They've been at it for ten minutes." Daniel sighed, setting down his utensils. He strode to the door and threw it open.

The scene in the hallway was startling. Grace had Benjamin pinned against the wall, gripping his collar while shouting in his face.

When Daniel appeared, both froze mid-argument. Diana had no choice but to step out behind him.

Benjamin's face lit up when he saw Diana. After all these years, she remained as breathtaking as ever!

Noticing his reaction, Grace grew even more enraged. She kicked Benjamin's shin hard before forcing a smile at Diana. "Sorry, Diana. I didn't realize you and Mr. Blackwood were staying here..."

Diana kept her expression blank. "I almost thought you were making a scene outside my room on purpose."

Grace forced a laugh. "Don't be ridiculous. I'm not that foolish." She sighed heavily. "We came because Serena found hidden cameras in her room. My father, Benjamin, and I came to apologize and resolve the situation..."

Before she could finish, Daniel's brows furrowed. "You're saying someone planted cameras in Serena's room?"

Grace nodded. "Yes, but I'm not sure—"

Daniel immediately stormed down the hallway and threw open Serena's door. "What's going on here?"
###Chapter 367

Daniel's abrupt entrance startled Evelyn, who was deep in conversation with Andrew in her suite. She quickly composed herself, flashing a practiced smile. "Everything's been handled. Someone planted hidden cameras in my room, but Mr. Donovan helped me remove them all."

Evelyn gestured toward the coffee table where the devices lay scattered. "They're all right here."

Daniel's gaze swept over the tiny cameras. He crossed the room in three strides, scooping several into his palm. "This many? Someone went to extraordinary lengths to spy on you."

He knew about the underground trade of hotel surveillance footage. Typically, such cameras would be placed near beds or bathrooms to capture compromising material. But this quantity suggested something far more calculated - a complete surveillance operation.

"Did you contact the authorities?"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "I withdrew my complaint."

Daniel's brow arched. Withdrew? What game was she playing now?

"I compensated Ms. Carter handsomely to avoid legal complications," Andrew interjected, rising with a weary sigh. "The transfer's complete. Unless there's anything else, I'll take my leave."

He strode out without waiting for dismissal, pausing only to glare at the arguing couple in the hallway. "Enough! Get some rest!"

Diana and Benjamin exchanged glances before trailing after him like chastened children.

Vanessa lingered by the door, watching through the crack until certain Daniel and Evelyn were distracted. She caught Andrew's eye with a questioning look.

Andrew gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head before disappearing down the corridor.

Moments later, Vanessa's phone vibrated with his message: [Ms. Prescott, Evelyn isn't the fool we took her for. Not only did we fail to obtain any compromising footage, she turned this into leverage against me... Delete everything I sent you. Circulating it now would jeopardize Prescott Industries.]

Vanessa's lips curled into something between a smirk and a snarl as she read. Jeopardize the Prescott empire?

Over Evelyn Carter?

Even if the footage surfaced, there were too many layers between her and the source. Let Evelyn try proving anything.

With deliberate slowness, Vanessa deleted the message before sauntering back to Evelyn's doorway. "Daniel," she cooed, leaning against the frame, "is Ms. Carter alright?"

Daniel's jaw tightened. "She's fine."

Noticing Vanessa's return, Evelyn made a show of gathering the cameras into a box. "Mr. Blackwood, it's late. Your wife must be waiting."

The words landed like a physical blow. Daniel studied her with narrowed eyes. "You're really letting this go?"

"Of course." Evelyn's smile was razor-thin. "They didn't get anything valuable anyway."

Daniel exhaled sharply before turning toward the door. Vanessa immediately latched onto his arm. "Daniel, this is terrifying! Do you think our suite could be bugged too?"

"Impossible." His response came clipped and certain.

Security was Lucas's domain. Every hotel room was swept before his arrival. This trip's last-minute nature had been the only lapse - one Evelyn had paid for.

Back in their suite, Vanessa tried steering Daniel toward the bedroom. He disentangled himself with practiced ease. "Don't wait up."

Vanessa's perfectly sculpted brows furrowed. "Daniel, it's past ten. Whatever it is can wait until morning."

But Daniel was already powering up his laptop, the blue glow etching shadows across his face. Some battles couldn't wait for daylight.
###Chapter 368

Daniel muttered a reply before turning on his heel and striding into the study.

Diana stood frozen, watching as he disappeared behind the closed door. Her teeth sank into her lower lip.

She had been by his side for so long, yet he still refused to share a bed with her. Even after mistaking Evelyn for her last night, he still rejected her. What was wrong with him? Did he have no heart?

After everything she had done for him, he still treated her like an outsider!

It had to be Evelyn’s fault. Evelyn was the only obstacle between them.

The only way to fix this was to remove Evelyn—permanently.

Meanwhile, inside the study, Daniel dropped the cameras onto his desk and addressed Ethan. "Trace the signal source of these. If any footage was recorded, find out where it was sent."

"Understood." Ethan pocketed the devices. "Sir, where did you find these?"

Daniel’s brows knitted together. "You’re asking me? Why wasn’t Evelyn’s room checked beforehand?"

Ethan stiffened. "What? These were in Ms. Evelyn’s room?"

Daniel shot him a sharp look. "Yes."

"That’s impossible." Ethan’s voice was laced with disbelief. "I swept every inch of her room before she moved in. Every time you travel with company staff, I inspect every suite—I never skip anyone. You know I don’t cut corners."

His gaze dropped to the cameras. "These couldn’t have been missed. I checked yesterday. There was nothing."

Daniel went rigid. "When exactly did you check?"

"While you and Ms. Evelyn were at the Prescotts’ estate. Should we review the hallway surveillance?"

Daniel pinched the bridge of his nose. "Pointless. Do you honestly believe the hotel owner’s denial? If they’re involved, do you think they’d leave evidence in the tapes? Think. Did you notice anything unusual yesterday?"

Ethan fell silent, his expression pensive. After a long moment, he exhaled. "I checked Ms. Evelyn’s room before yours. When I came out, I saw Mrs. Blackwood standing outside her door, gripping the knob. I couldn’t tell if she was entering or leaving. When she noticed me, she claimed she mistook it for your suite."

Daniel’s frown deepened. "Are you suggesting Diana planted them?"

"No, no." Ethan shook his head quickly. "It just struck me as odd. Ms. Evelyn’s room is standard, while yours is always a presidential suite. The signs are clearly marked. Mrs. Blackwood used to book your hotels herself—she’d know which room you’d be in."

Daniel massaged his temples. "Haven’t you noticed how different Diana is now? She barely remembers anything from before."

When Gwen and Ben argued in the hallway earlier, she hadn’t cared. She’d hesitated before stepping out, then scolded them for causing a scene instead of calming them down.

Even if the accident altered her personality, it didn’t explain how she treated her oldest friends.
###Chapter 369

Evelyn's night was restless. She drifted between dreams, each one pulling her under only to spit her back out moments later.

In her nightmares, photos of her spread like wildfire across the internet. Strangers dissected her life, hurling judgments and threats. Some even vowed to destroy her.

When her phone rang at dawn, she jolted awake, her skin slick with sweat. She grabbed the device, her head pounding. "Hello?"

"It's me," Theodore's voice came through, steady but concerned. "Oliver reached out this morning. He told me what happened in Mariner's Cove." A sigh. "I need to wrap up some things at the gallery, but I'll be there by afternoon."

Evelyn hesitated. "I'm fine. You don't need to come."

"Of course I do." Another sigh. "Oliver told me everything—the cocktail party, the cameras in your room. Being there alone must be hell. Daniel and Diana are back together now. He'll side with her. If I'm not there for you, who will be?"

Her heart stuttered. She bit her lip, silent.

It hit her then—in Mariner's Cove, the city she'd called home for twenty years, she had no one left to trust.

Finally, she exhaled. "Alright. Thank you." The words felt heavy. She wasn’t as unbreakable as she pretended to be.

"Don’t worry. You’ve got me now," Theodore reassured her. They spoke a little longer before hanging up.

Evelyn set the phone down and stared at the ceiling.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. She opened the door to find Diana standing there, holding a takeout bag.

"Daniel and I grabbed breakfast. We got you something too."

Evelyn glanced past her. Daniel stood by the hallway window, his back to her, gazing outside.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. She shoved the bag back into Diana's hands. "Not hungry." Then she shut the door in her face.

Diana's voice carried through the wood. "Daniel, can you believe her? I was just trying to be nice!"

His reply was ice. "If she doesn’t want it, I’ll eat it."

"You’re the best."

Evelyn almost laughed.

Theodore was right. Daniel would always choose Diana. And no one would choose her.

At 9 p.m., Ethan knocked. "Ms. Carter, it's time."

She grabbed her jacket and the files Daniel had given her the night before, then followed him out.

An RV waited outside the hotel. She yanked the door open. Inside sat Daniel, Diana, and a stranger.

Diana immediately clung to Daniel. "Evelyn, this is Gavin Whitmore from Prescott Group. Vivian sent him to join us for the supplier visit." She smiled sweetly. "Since the Prescotts sent someone, they must feel guilty about what happened at the party."

"Indeed." Gavin adjusted his glasses, studying Evelyn. "Ms. Carter is quite striking. No wonder there was... confusion."
###Chapter 370

"The staff member who made the mistake with the guest list has been dealt with. My only purpose here is to properly welcome Ms. Evelyn to Mariner's Cove." Gavin's expression made Evelyn's skin crawl.

The RV had two rows of seats. Daniel and Diana sat on one side, while Gavin occupied the other. After a brief hesitation, Evelyn chose to sit across from him.

Uncomfortable, she deliberately took the seat farthest from him, but Gavin didn’t seem to notice—or care. Instead, he leaned closer. "Ms. Evelyn, I heard you're one of the most talented jewelry designers in the industry. Is that true?"

His cologne was overpowering. Evelyn subtly shifted away, but Gavin followed. With no other choice, she placed her documents between them as a barrier.

Gavin frowned and reached for the papers.

"Don’t."

Daniel’s voice cut through the air just as Gavin’s fingers brushed the files. Daniel opened his eyes, giving him a cold look. "Those belong to Blackwood Group. Hands off."

Gavin froze, then slowly retracted his hand. "My apologies, Mr. Blackwood."

Without another word, Daniel disentangled himself from Diana’s grip and stood. He walked over to Evelyn. "Move."

Evelyn frowned but obeyed.

Daniel smoothly took her vacated seat and gestured to his previous spot beside Diana. "Sit there."

Realization dawned—he was helping her. Sitting next to Diana wasn’t ideal, but it was better than enduring Gavin’s advances. She exhaled, gathered her documents, and settled beside Diana.

Silence filled the RV.

Diana clenched her fists. She had brought Gavin along specifically to unsettle Evelyn. But she never expected Daniel—who usually avoided unnecessary interactions—to switch seats for her sake.

The rest of the ride passed in tense quiet. Daniel closed his eyes, feigning sleep. Gavin, thoroughly cowed, didn’t dare speak.

Diana kept stealing glances at Evelyn, who remained focused on her notes, as if nothing had happened.

By 10 AM, they arrived at one of Prescott Group’s factories. The moment the RV stopped, Gavin jumped out and positioned himself by the door, one hand on the handle, the other extended toward Evelyn. "Ms. Evelyn, allow me."

Evelyn hesitated, but before she could refuse, someone shoved her from behind. She stumbled forward—straight into Gavin’s arms.

His hands locked around her waist. The scent of his cologne made her stomach turn. She struggled, but his grip was ironclad. With a sharp twist, she slapped him across the face. "Let go!"

Gavin released her instantly, stunned, clutching his cheek.

Evelyn turned away, furiously wiping her clothes with a tissue.

Diana hopped down with an apologetic smile. "Oh no! I tripped and accidentally bumped into Ms. Evelyn." She glanced at Gavin. "What happened?"

Gavin scoffed, still holding his face. "Ms. Evelyn nearly fell. I caught her without thinking, but she assumed I was being inappropriate and slapped me."

Diana frowned at Evelyn, who was still scrubbing at her sleeves. "Ms. Evelyn, Gavin was just trying to help. Isn’t this a bit of an overreaction? You should apologize."
###Chapter 371

Evelyn chuckled at Diana's words, shooting her a sharp look. "You expect an apology from me?"

Diana had deliberately shoved her, sending her tumbling straight into Gavin's arms. He had taken the opportunity to grope her, yet she was the one who needed to apologize?

"Absolutely, you should." Diana pressed her lips together, ready to continue when Daniel ended his call and stepped out of the car. He had been preoccupied with the phone conversation and missed the altercation outside. His gaze flicked between Gavin, who was nursing his swollen cheek, and Evelyn, who was wiping her hands with a tissue. "What happened?"

Diana immediately latched onto Daniel's arm. "When I was getting out of the car, I accidentally bumped into Evelyn, and she fell. Gavin caught her to keep her from hitting the ground, but she accused him of taking advantage of her."

She pointed at Gavin's reddened face. "Look. She slapped him hard, and now she's acting like she's the one who was wronged. Don’t you think that’s disrespectful, Evelyn? I asked her to apologize, but she refused."

Daniel frowned, his eyes narrowing at Evelyn. "Is that true?"

Evelyn stilled, lifting her chin to meet his gaze directly. "Yes. Are you really going to force me to apologize to a man who just groped me, Mr. Blackwood?"

Gavin stiffened, his expression darkening. "I was helping you. How dare you accuse me of something so vile?"

"He's right," Diana chimed in. "Daniel, the Prescotts sent Gavin to guide us today, but now Evelyn has made things awkward. At best, people will think she's just being overly defensive. At worst, they might assume there’s bad blood between Blackwood Group and Prescott Corporation. A simple apology would fix this, so why is she being so difficult?"

Evelyn knew exactly what Diana was doing—twisting the situation to pressure her into apologizing by dragging the company’s reputation into it. But she wouldn’t bend. Tossing the tissue into a nearby bin, she crossed her arms. "I won’t apologize."

Evelyn wasn’t prideful. She had swallowed her dignity to work as Daniel’s maid, all to save her child’s life. But apologizing to Gavin? Never. She knew if she gave in now, Diana and Gavin would only push harder next time.

Besides, Evelyn was certain Gavin hadn’t acted out of concern. This was a setup, another one of Diana’s petty schemes to humiliate her.

"Evelyn, it’s just two words. What’s the big deal?" Diana rolled her eyes. "Say sorry, and this whole mess goes away. If you don’t, Daniel will have to clean up the fallout with the Prescotts."

"Exactly," Daniel cut in before Diana could finish. "Just say sorry." His gaze flicked to Evelyn, then back to Diana. "Apologize to him."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Her face paled. He was really siding with them?

She knew Daniel wasn’t blind. In the car, he had noticed her discomfort around Gavin and switched seats with her. He knew how uneasy Gavin made her.

And yet, after Diana’s little speech, he was demanding she apologize to that creep?
###Chapter 372

Evelyn narrowed her eyes at Daniel. "Does Mr. Blackwood truly believe my refusal to apologize will jeopardize the partnership between Blackwood Group and Prescott Enterprises?"

Even if Prescott had sent Gavin, he was just a junior employee. If they were willing to abandon this deal over him, then the collaboration wasn't worth pursuing in the first place.

Daniel knew that. Yet his piercing gaze remained fixed on her, silently demanding compliance.

"I'm here for a site inspection, not to mediate petty disputes." His voice was cold as he glanced between Evelyn and Diana. "Apologize. Now."

Diana's lips curled in triumph. She clung to Daniel's arm, smirking at Evelyn. "You heard him, Ms. Carter. Daniel has given you a direct order. Or do you think your position makes you exempt from following instructions?"

Her gloating was cut short when Daniel abruptly pulled his arm free. His frown deepened. "Diana, I meant you."

Her face paled. "Me?"

"Yes." His tone left no room for argument. "You caused this mess. Gavin was only trying to help, and Evelyn defended herself. Neither of them owes anyone an apology."

Diana's mouth opened, then closed. The buzzing in her ears drowned out everything else. "So... this is my fault?"

Daniel didn't answer.

The silence was deafening. Evelyn and Gavin exchanged stunned glances. No one had expected Daniel to side against his own wife.

But then again, Diana had been the instigator.

"Tick-tock," Daniel murmured, checking his watch. "Diana, I warned you not to tag along. If you're going to waste more time, I'll have Ethan escort you back to the hotel."

Her jaw clenched. After a tense pause, she spun on her heel and marched toward Evelyn and Gavin.

"I'm sorry," she spat, her voice trembling. "It was all my fault."

Without waiting for a response, she whirled around, swiping angrily at her eyes. "I didn't even mean to bump into her!"

Evelyn scoffed. That wasn't what Diana had claimed earlier.

"Diana." Daniel's voice softened slightly. He caught up to her, pulling her close as he murmured something in her ear.

The sight of them—his arm around her shoulders, his lips brushing her hair—sent a sharp pang through Evelyn's chest.

Gavin cleared his throat. "Shall we proceed, Ms. Carter?" He gestured toward the factory entrance, deliberately raising his voice. "Funny how Mr. Blackwood still dotes on his wife, even when she's clearly in the wrong. Love really does conquer all, huh?"
###Chapter 373

Evelyn knew Gavin's words were meant to provoke her. Though she recognized his game, the sting still found its mark.

He wasn't wrong. Even after Daniel forced Diana to apologize, nothing had truly changed. Diana remained his priority.

Evelyn's chest constricted, but she exhaled sharply and shook off the thought.

Clutching her files tighter, she brushed past Gavin toward the factory floor. His mocking chuckle followed as he matched her pace. "Still single, Ms. Carter? Doesn't it ache watching Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood's devotion? Though I'm sure someone's caught your eye already."

She ignored him, quickening her steps. Gavin persisted, his voice dripping with false cheer as he trailed her like a shadow.

Evelyn bit back her irritation. Reacting would only amuse him, and Daniel wouldn't intervene twice. Silence was her sharpest weapon.

They found Daniel and Diana inspecting the assembly line. Evelyn immediately approached the foreman, absorbing his technical explanations with single-minded focus.

So immersed was she that she missed Daniel's appreciative glance. Missed Diana's venomous glare. Missed the shouts as a jagged jade chunk hurtled toward her.

"Look out!"

Daniel moved like lightning, shoving her aside just as the rock struck his forearm with a sickening crack.

"Daniel!" Diana shrieked, clawing at his sleeve. "Are you hurt?"

He scowled at Evelyn while cradling his arm. "Were you deaf? Didn't you hear the warnings?" The anger in his voice couldn't mask his concern.

Dazed from the push, Evelyn blinked at the scene—the fallen jade, Daniel's injury, the panicked worker scooping up the rogue stone.

"My deepest apologies!" The man trembled. "It slipped during unloading—"

Diana rounded on him, face twisted. "Apologies? My husband could've been killed!" Her glare flicked to Evelyn. "If it hit anyone else, fine. But him? His body is worth more than all of you combined!"

The worker stiffened. "With respect, ma'am, the rock was headed for that lady. Your husband chose to intervene."

Diana's flawless complexion drained of color.
###Chapter 374

Evelyn clenched her jaw, her eyes flashing with fury as she glared at the worker. "Are you seriously trying to pin this on someone else? Do you realize I could have you—" She cut herself off abruptly, remembering she wasn’t Vivian Prescott anymore. The factory and everyone in it belonged to the Prescotts now.

Her fingers curled into fists as she shot the supervisor a venomous look. "Fix this. Now."

The supervisor flinched. For a split second, her voice had carried the same chilling authority as Vivian’s. "Y-yes, right away!"

Satisfied with the hasty promise, Evelyn whirled toward Daniel. "What are you standing there for? He just saved your life. Help him!"

Evelyn’s sharp tone snapped her out of her daze. She rushed forward, gripping Daniel’s uninjured arm to steady him.

Though no bones were broken, the wound was deep. Blood soaked through his sleeve, staining his fingers as he clutched his arm, his jaw tight with pain. A strange ache twisted in Evelyn’s chest—why had he done it? And why did the sight of his injury unsettle her so much?

"Follow me!" The supervisor ushered them out of the factory in a panic.

At the clinic, the doctor peeled back Daniel’s jacket, revealing the full extent of the damage. The fabric was saturated with blood.

Evelyn gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. "Oh my God!"

Her horrified gaze flicked from the wound to Evelyn. "This is all your fault!" Rage surged through her, and she raised her hand, ready to strike.

But before the slap could land, Daniel intercepted her. His uninjured arm shot up, blocking her path. "It was an accident. Not her fault."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. "Daniel, if she had just moved faster—"

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. "She’s too slow. Couldn’t have dodged in time." Though the words were critical, his tone held something softer.

Evelyn’s glare burned into Evelyn. "If there’s any permanent damage, you’re paying for it."

Evelyn stayed silent, unmoving.

"Luckily, no fractures," the doctor announced, exhaling in relief. After a quick examination, he numbed the area and began stitching the wound.

The supervisor wrung his hands, his voice trembling. "Mr. Blackwood, I can’t apologize enough. We’ll investigate this thoroughly and hold those responsible accountable!"

Evelyn scoffed. "You better. But the one most responsible is standing right here." She jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "You did this on purpose. Daniel made me apologize earlier, but he comforted me, not you. You were jealous, so you let him get hurt!"
###Chapter 375

The unexpected accusation left Evelyn speechless. She froze for a second before letting out a cold laugh. "Why would I care?"

It was true—she hadn't heard the worker's warning shouts. She hadn't caught Daniel or Diana's frantic calls either. If she had, why would she have stayed in danger's path?

Evelyn exhaled sharply and leveled Diana with a piercing look. "Mrs. Blackwood, are you implying I was so confident Mr. Blackwood would save me that I deliberately put myself at risk?"

Diana's face paled.

With a mocking smile, Evelyn pressed on. "You're right about one thing—Mr. Blackwood made you apologize to me earlier, but he still comforted you, not me. That alone proves where his priorities lie. So tell me, why would I gamble on him rescuing me? If I'd miscalculated, I'd be the one in that treatment room right now, getting stitched up."

She tilted her head. "Mrs. Blackwood, if you were in my position, would you risk your life out of sheer jealousy?"

Diana's face turned whiter than the clinic walls. After a tense pause, she bit her lip and snapped, "You knew Daniel saw that rock coming! You knew he'd save you because you're one of Pierce Corporation's top employees!"

Since she couldn't attack Evelyn's relationship with Daniel, she resorted to his reputation as a devoted employer. "Daniel values all his staff! If any of them were in danger, he'd step in without hesitation!"

Evelyn studied Diana and realized arguing was futile. The woman was determined to believe this was all some calculated scheme.

"Ms. Carter is an exceptional asset," the supervisor cut in with a sigh. "Of course Mr. Blackwood would protect her. Earlier, she was so absorbed in reviewing the data that she blocked everything else out. In my ten years here, I've never seen anyone so dedicated..."

Diana scowled. "What does that matter? She—"

"Her dedication means she’s invaluable to Pierce Corporation’s jewelry division," Daniel interrupted, stepping out of the treatment room. His arm was wrapped in thick bandages, secured in a sling.

Despite the injury, he carried himself with the same commanding presence—if anything, the sling only added to his air of unshakable authority.

"Evelyn was too focused on her work to hear any warnings," he stated, his gaze flicking to Diana. "If I hadn’t pushed her aside, that rock would’ve shattered her spine. And then you would’ve had to take over her notes."

Diana’s expression darkened. "But—"

"No 'buts.' Evelyn is intelligent. She wouldn’t risk her life for petty revenge."

Diana’s jaw tightened. She couldn’t believe Daniel was defending Evelyn—even praising her focus and intellect!

Her voice trembled. "Daniel, I was just worried about you..."

"I know." His tone softened briefly before turning stern. "But that doesn’t excuse how you spoke about my employee." He glanced at Evelyn. "Your focus is commendable, but next time, stay aware of your surroundings. I won’t save you twice."

Without another word, he strode out. Diana hurried after him. "Where are you going?"

"Back to the workshop. We’re not finished yet."
###Chapter 376

"You're injured..."

"That doesn't mean we should slow down."

The voices faded as the two figures walked away. Evelyn remained frozen, an inexplicable weight settling in her chest.

After a long silence, the supervisor cleared his throat awkwardly. "Ms. Carter, shall we... proceed?"

Evelyn blinked, snapping out of her daze. She picked up the documents in front of her and nodded. "Yes, let's continue."

By noon, they had completed the site inspection. The original plan was to eat in the car while heading to the next location for the design symposium.

But Diana, citing Daniel's injury, insisted on stopping at a nearby restaurant. Evelyn wanted to leave immediately, but since neither Daniel nor Gavin objected, she had no choice but to follow.

Inside the restaurant, Diana and Daniel sat on one side of the table, while Evelyn and Gavin took the other. The arrangement made her skin crawl.

"Daniel, your arm is hurt. Let me feed you," Diana cooed the moment their food arrived.

Daniel frowned, glancing at his sling before giving a reluctant nod. Diana practically glowed with triumph. She scooped up a bite, blew on it dramatically, and held the spoon to his lips like he was a child.

Daniel's discomfort was obvious. His jaw tightened the entire time.

Across from him, Evelyn kept her head down, forcing herself to focus on her meal. She tuned out Diana's sickeningly sweet voice, repeating in her mind: Don't listen. Don't care.

She was just Daniel's ex-wife. She had only returned to conceive his child. Who he chose to be with now didn’t concern her.

Yet the more she repeated it, the more her stomach twisted.

"Hey, slow down," Gavin murmured beside her.

Evelyn tensed. Before she could react, his fork slid a piece of steak onto her plate. "You should eat more, Ms. Carter. You're too thin."

She looked up and met his leering gaze. A wave of nausea hit her. She stabbed the meat and dropped it back onto his plate. "No, thank you."

Then she realized—her fork had touched the same piece he had. The thought made her lose her appetite entirely.

She set down her utensils. "I'm done."

Daniel's eyes flicked to her half-finished meal, then to Diana's untouched plate. "Diana, switch seats with Evelyn."

Diana froze, spoon still hovering. "What? Why?"

Daniel's voice was flat. "Evelyn's finished eating. Since she has nothing better to do, she can feed me instead."
###Chapter 377

The dining table fell into stunned silence, broken only by the sound of Gavin sipping his water.

Evelyn stared at Daniel with wide, disbelieving eyes. Had he really just asked another woman to feed him right in front of his wife?

"I refuse." Evelyn shot Daniel a withering look before turning to Diana's frozen expression. She picked up her phone, pretending to scroll through messages.

Diana smiled tightly. For once, she actually agreed with Evelyn. "Since Ms. Carter declined, I'll continue feeding you."

"Who said she gets to refuse?" Daniel tapped the table impatiently with his left hand. "I got these stitches because of her. Is feeding me too much to ask in return?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw. She had no choice but to comply. "Your wife is already feeding you," she pointed out coldly.

"Yes, but she hasn't eaten anything yet." Daniel's gaze never left Evelyn's face. "Since you're finished, you can take over. Is that simple request really too difficult?"

The realization hit Evelyn suddenly. This wasn't about her feeding him - it was about giving Diana a chance to eat. Diana hadn't touched her food since they arrived.

'Why does he never show me that kind of consideration?' The bitter thought flashed through Evelyn's mind.

With a scoff, she stood abruptly. Brushing past Gavin, she approached Diana. "Switch seats with me, Mrs. Blackwood."

Diana bit her lip, throwing Daniel a pleading look. "I'm not hungry yet. I'll eat after-"

"Eat now," Daniel interrupted with a soft chuckle. "You've gone all day without food. I won't have you starving."

Defeated, Diana shot Evelyn a venomous glare before moving to sit beside Gavin. She began eating with aggressive, jerky movements.

Evelyn sighed, picking up Daniel's utensils. She speared a piece of his favorite roasted vegetables and held it out stiffly. "Open."

Her tone was icy, but she'd deliberately chosen food she knew he liked. Daniel's lips curved into a smile as he obediently opened his mouth.

The feeding continued in this mechanical fashion - Evelyn's movements brusque and impersonal. Yet despite her cold demeanor, Daniel felt an unexpected warmth spreading through his chest.

Memories flooded back - nights when she'd curled against him, soft and pliant in his arms. The contrast between that tender woman and the rigid one before him now was almost painful. She treated him with such deliberate detachment, as if...
###Chapter 377

Daniel couldn't figure out what to make of Evelyn at all.

Which version of her was real? What did she truly feel about him?

He didn't realize he'd been staring at Evelyn until Diana noticed. The woman's movements turned noticeably sharper, more aggressive.

Gavin cleared his throat softly, sensing the shift in Diana's mood.

Daniel snapped out of it, quickly averting his gaze.

"Open," Evelyn commanded again, lifting another forkful of food toward his lips.
###Chapter 378

Daniel's gaze sharpened. "Is this how you thank the man who saved your life?"

Evelyn plastered on a tight smile and continued feeding him. "If this happens again, Mr. Blackwood, I’d prefer you didn’t intervene. First, I’m just an employee—I don’t need my CEO playing hero. Second, if I get hurt, paid leave or compensation would suffice. No rescue missions necessary."

She shot Diana a pointed look. "I’d rather take the injury than deal with false accusations over something I never intended."

Diana paled at the remark. Her lips parted to retaliate, but Daniel silenced her with a single glance.

"I’d do it again," Daniel said, turning back to Evelyn with a smirk. "Diana was right. A good boss protects his employees—especially his star designer." He studied her reaction before adding, "Though I wouldn’t mind a little more enthusiasm from said employee while she’s feeding me."

Evelyn tensed. After a beat, she exhaled and adjusted her grip on the fork, offering the next bite with marginally less irritation.

She knew he had a point. Their relationship was strictly professional. She should’ve shown more gratitude instead of acting petty.

The meal ended swiftly, and the group moved on to the next stop of their industry tour. The afternoon sessions flew by—mostly gathering intel on emerging jewelry trends and design innovations.

No physical dangers this time, but Evelyn found herself battling a different kind of frustration. Diana’s antics left her both baffled and mortified.

The woman had handled display samples without permission, leafed through confidential sketches, and even defaced a competitor’s design board with doodles.

As the CEO’s wife, Diana was untouchable. Evelyn had no choice but to apologize on her behalf and scold her privately later.

It was deliberate. No one with basic manners would pull such stunts. Diana was clearly trying to provoke her.

By 8 PM, the tour concluded. The final host, Maxwell Scott—an old friend of Daniel’s—insisted on dinner. Daniel accepted, so Evelyn, Diana, and Gavin tagged along.

As soon as they sat, Maxwell raised his glass. "Daniel, it’s been too long!"

"Actually," Diana cut in sweetly, intercepting the drink, "Daniel’s arm is injured. Alcohol isn’t advisable."

Maxwell blinked, then chuckled. "Well then, Mrs. Blackwood, why don’t you take the toast instead?"

"Oh, I couldn’t," Diana demurred. "I’m a terrible lightweight—might embarrass myself." She gestured to Evelyn. "But Ms. Carter here? She’s the star of this trip. Besides..."

A sly smile curled her lips. "She owes Daniel a debt. What better way to repay it than drinking in his place?"
###Chapter 379

The moment Diana Hart spoke, Maxwell Scott placed the glass firmly in front of Evelyn Carter. "Here you go, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn's brows knitted as she eyed the amber liquid but didn't reach for it. "I'm just an employee. Accepting a toast from you seems inappropriate, Mr. Scott." She flicked a glance at Daniel Blackwood before adding, "And I don't handle alcohol well. I might embarrass myself if I drink."

Noticing how Evelyn's gaze lingered on Daniel, Diana tightened her grip on his arm. "I disagree, Ms. Carter. Mr. Blackwood risked his life for you—hardly something he'd do for just any employee." Her lips curled into a smirk as she lied smoothly, "It's just one drink. You won't get drunk from that."

Evelyn arched a brow, her eyes locking onto Daniel's. "Mr. Blackwood, do you really want me to take this drink for you?"

Daniel exhaled, casting a warning look at Maxwell. "I don't think that's necessary, Mr. Scott." He remembered all too well how Evelyn behaved when drunk—chaotic, unpredictable.

Maxwell scoffed, undeterred. "Mr. Blackwood seems exceptionally protective of his employees. Then again, it makes sense—he did nearly die for one." His gaze slid to Evelyn, mocking. "Ms. Carter must be very special to warrant such devotion."

The insinuation was blatant. Evelyn's jaw tightened as she pushed back her chair. "Excuse me. I need the restroom."

"Evelyn." Diana's voice cut through the air like a whip. "You keep insisting there's nothing between you and Daniel, that it's strictly professional. Yet you refuse to drink for him, and you don't bother correcting Mr. Scott's assumptions." Her eyes narrowed. "Are you trying to make people think otherwise?"

Daniel's expression darkened. "Diana." His tone was sharp, a clear warning. He glanced at Evelyn, then back at Diana. "We don't owe explanations to anyone."

Maxwell bristled. "Mr. Blackwood, we're about to be business partners. Is that how you speak to someone who matters?"

Daniel smirked, unimpressed. "Mr. Scott, do you honestly think a potential contract gives you the right to comment on my personal life?" He stood, tugging Diana's wrist. "If so, consider our deal terminated."

Diana yanked her hand free, glaring at Evelyn. "You're making Daniel lose a multimillion-dollar partnership over a drink. How selfish can you be?"

Evelyn's fingers curled. Maxwell's company was a powerhouse in jewelry—critical for Blackwood Group's new venture. But to Daniel, this deal was insignificant compared to his empire.

Still...

She sighed, meeting Daniel's gaze. "It's fine." Her voice was steady. "Mr. Scott meant no harm. It's just one glass."

Before anyone could protest, she grabbed the glass and downed it in one swallow. The burn made her wince, but she forced a smile.

Daniel's chest tightened. The sight dragged up a memory—years ago, when they'd just married. Evelyn had begged to accompany him to a party, and he'd reluctantly agreed.

That night, she'd drunk too much.

And chaos had followed.
###Chapter 380

The memory flashed through Daniel's mind like a bolt of lightning. Years ago, they'd faced a similar situation with another difficult client who'd insisted Evelyn drink. As her husband, Daniel knew Evelyn had zero alcohol tolerance. He'd been ready to storm out of that damned meeting.

But Evelyn, ever the martyr for Blackwood Enterprises, had knocked back the entire glass in one go. Daniel could still picture her face—that mix of pain and stubborn determination.

The same expression she wore now.

Daniel's jaw tightened as he glanced at Diana standing beside him. His current wife watched Evelyn with barely concealed triumph, her lips curling in disdain.

Something twisted in Daniel's chest. When had the Evelyn Carter he'd fallen for become this person? The woman who'd once endured a night of violent illness after drinking for his company was now forcing others to do the same?

Evelyn slammed her empty glass onto the table with deliberate force. "Satisfied, Mr. Scott?"

Maxwell Scott studied Evelyn's rapidly reddening face with amusement before chuckling. "Impressive, Ms. Carter. Though considering your earlier... resistance, shouldn't you take another as penalty?"

A dangerous smile played on Evelyn's lips. "I did warn you I'm a lightweight, Mr. Scott. If I do something regrettable while intoxicated, will you take responsibility?"

Scott's eyes gleamed. "For a woman as exquisite as you? Absolutely!"

"Perfect." Evelyn accepted the refilled glass without hesitation.

"Evelyn." Daniel's voice was low, warning. "Enough."

They could've left after the first drink. He'd only stayed to salvage the deal because of her stupid sacrifice. Why push further?

"Relax, darling. Mr. Scott promised to handle the consequences." With that, Evelyn downed the second glass.

Scott licked his lips, gaze roaming over her. "I'm dying to see how a proper lady behaves when drunk."

Evelyn rose unsteadily, her words slightly slurred. "Then watch closely." She stumbled toward Diana—and struck.

The slap echoed through the private dining room. Everyone froze except a swaying Evelyn.

Diana touched her stinging cheek in disbelief before lunging with a shriek. "You bitch—"

Evelyn caught her wrist mid-swing, grip ironclad despite her drunken state. "This is what happens when I drink, Mrs. Blackwood. You insisted, remember?"

Scott gaped. "What the hell—"

Evelyn turned her icy glare on him. "You guaranteed responsibility for my actions, Mr. Scott." Her sickly sweet tone dripped venom. "Or was that just another lie?"
###Chapter 381

The entire restaurant froze into stunned silence.

Ethan Reynolds stood paralyzed, his mouth hanging open in shock. He'd given his word to take responsibility for Evelyn Carter's actions if she got drunk, but this...

She'd just struck Diana Hart - Daniel Blackwood's wife!

Daniel Blackwood ruled Willowbrook with an iron fist. Just because he was currently in Mariner's Cove didn't mean anyone could disrespect him!

Ethan's hands trembled violently as he struggled to form coherent words.

Meanwhile, Diana buried her tear-streaked face against Daniel's chest. "Daniel, she hurt me!"

Daniel's jaw tightened as he gently pulled Diana's hand away from her cheek. A bright red handprint marred her delicate skin.

Cold fury flashed in his eyes. Though he'd been annoyed by Diana pressuring Evelyn to drink...

This was still his wife!

He cradled Diana protectively while shooting Ethan a glacial look. "Get some ice. Now."

The terrified Ethan scrambled to obey.

Once Ethan left, Daniel turned his icy gaze on Evelyn. "I tolerate much from you, but this crosses the line! However flawed Diana may be, she remains my wife! You will show her respect!"

Evelyn swayed slightly, her vision blurred from alcohol. "You said nothing when Mrs. Blackwood forced drink after drink on me." Her laugh held no warmth. "I warned you all what happens when I'm drunk."

Her contemptuous gaze swept over Ethan, then Diana cowering in Daniel's arms. "None of you cared about my warnings earlier. Now that I've done exactly what I said I would, suddenly I'm the villain?" She grabbed another glass. "You wanted me to drink? Fine!"

One glass after another disappeared down her throat under Daniel's furious stare.

Finally, she staggered toward them, her drunken gaze locking onto Diana. Her hand lifted again - she'd wanted to do this for so long!

This woman who'd stolen her identity, tormented her children, constantly viewed her with suspicion and malice...

"Evelyn!" Daniel caught her wrist in a vice-like grip, shoving her away. "Enough! Drunkenness excuses nothing! You'll answer for this when you're sober!"

"Answer?" Evelyn repeated with a bitter laugh. Pointing at Diana, she spat, "When she tortured Liam and Emily, did she answer for that? When she made them sick, when she had them kidnapped - did she pay for those crimes? She's abused six-year-old children in every way imaginable, yet faces no consequences. But one slap from me and suddenly justice must be served?"
###Chapter 382

"Daniel Blackwood, have you no shame?"

Both Daniel and Diana's expressions darkened at Evelyn's accusation.

His jaw clenched as he glared at her without responding.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips as she lifted her wine glass again. Liquid courage fueled her next words.

"Six years ago, you destroyed Evelyn Carter so completely she nearly died. Now you're playing the devoted husband to Diana? Who exactly are you trying to fool?"

Daniel's control snapped. "What the hell are you talking about?"

Diana's teeth ground together. Seeing Daniel's rising anger, she quickly disentangled herself from his arms.

She couldn't let Evelyn continue. Not another word.

If Evelyn revealed her true identity now, everything would be ruined.

Panic drove Diana's hand up in a vicious arc. The slap connected with Evelyn's cheek with brutal force.

The impact sent the intoxicated woman stumbling backward. Her hip struck a chair, sending both crashing to the floor.

The sound of splintering wood echoed through the room.

Pain radiated through Evelyn's body - her throbbing cheek, her bruised ribs, her aching arm. Hot tears spilled as the metallic taste of blood filled her mouth.

"Ms. Carter...!"

Mr. Scott stood frozen, horrified by the unfolding scene.

Evelyn struggled to rise, but Diana already raised her hand for another strike.

"Diana."

Daniel caught her wrist with his uninjured left hand, brows furrowed. "She hit you once. You've returned it tenfold. That's enough."

Anyone could see the difference - Diana's slap carried murderous intent.

"But Daniel," Diana whimpered, eyes glistening with crocodile tears, "she'll attack me again if you don't stop her."

She wiped at dry cheeks. "Tell me, who's your wife? Why are you protecting her?"

The question made Daniel's grip falter slightly.

Seizing the moment, Diana yanked her hand free and swung again.

CRASH!

The door burst open.

Theodore charged in like an avenging angel, sweeping Evelyn into his arms just as Diana's hand sliced through empty air.

"Idiot," he murmured, cradling Evelyn's bleeding lip. "Why didn't you duck?"

His head snapped up, eyes glacial. "Is this how Blackwood Enterprises treats its star employees, Daniel? Beating them when they're drunk?"

Daniel shielded Diana behind him, expression icy. "This doesn't concern you."

Theodore's laugh held no humor. "Doesn't concern me? I told you - Evelyn's my girlfriend!"

His glare could have frozen lava. "You drag her on business trips, force her to drink with clients, then assault her when she's vulnerable? What kind of monsters are you?"

He spat the next words like poison. "Now I understand the true culture of Blackwood Enterprises."

"Home..." Evelyn slurred against Theodore's chest, tears streaking her swollen cheek. "Daniel... I want to go home..."
###Chapter 383

Daniel's grip on Evelyn tightened slightly.

"D-Daniel... I want to go home..." Evelyn slurred drunkenly in Theodore's arms.

Her words were barely coherent. The first whisper had been for Theodore's ears only, but this time, everyone at the table heard her clearly.

Maxwell Scott froze mid-bite.

Diana Hart's face drained of color as she shot a nervous glance at Daniel.

Daniel's dark eyes locked onto Evelyn. "She's clearly intoxicated."

Theodore's jaw clenched. He adjusted his hold on Evelyn and shot Daniel a glare before carrying her out of the restaurant.

Daniel's gaze remained fixed on the empty doorway long after they'd left, his expression unreadable.

"Evelyn must be really drunk..." Diana ventured cautiously, studying Daniel's reaction.

Daniel didn't respond. He simply returned to his meal, his perfect profile giving nothing away. Diana forced a smile while seething inside.

This couldn't continue. Evelyn's true identity would be exposed at this rate. She needed to eliminate Evelyn from Daniel's life.

Outside the hotel, Evelyn kept mumbling Daniel's name the entire way. Theodore didn't know which hotel she was staying at, so he took her to a nearby inn.

The moment they entered the room, Evelyn collapsed in the bathroom, violently ill.

Theodore's heart ached as he handed her a glass of water. "If you can't hold your liquor, why force yourself? No one was making you drink."

Evelyn looked up with glassy, tear-filled eyes. "But... it was my first business dinner with Daniel since our marriage. When his partner offered me a drink, how could I refuse? I didn't want to embarrass him. I didn't want him to think I'm... inadequate."

She doubled over the toilet again. Theodore stared at her in shock.

Her drunken confession hit him like a thunderbolt. His hand stilled on her back. "Evelyn... Evelyn Carter?"

"Hmm?" She lifted her tear-streaked face to him, confusion swimming in her bloodshot eyes.

Theodore felt the blood drain from his face.

Evelyn Carter.

Liam, Sophia, and Oliver who was abroad. How had he missed the connection?

Thirty minutes later, a thoroughly exhausted Evelyn finally passed out. Theodore watched her sleep for a long moment before stepping onto the balcony to make a call.

"I know who you really are," he said quietly into the phone.

Evelyn never returned to her hotel.

After seeing Maxwell off, Daniel's first stop was the front desk to check Evelyn's whereabouts. When security footage showed Theodore hadn't brought her back, his expression darkened.

"Turn Mariner's Cove upside down if you have to," he ordered Ethan through gritted teeth. "Find her."

Ethan nodded and turned to leave when Diana blocked his path.

"Daniel, this is ridiculous," she said with forced calm. "Theodore took her—she's not missing. And didn't he say he's her boyfriend? They probably went somewhere... private after drinking."

Daniel's eyes turned glacial. "He's not her boyfriend."
###Chapter 384

Daniel's voice cut through the night, cold and resolute.

Evelyn let out a soft laugh. "Daniel, if Theodore isn't her boyfriend, why didn't she deny it when he claimed to be?"

His brow furrowed as he met her gaze. "Why didn't Evelyn refuse when you pressured her to drink? Did she want to?"

Diana paled slightly, lips parting to argue, but Daniel spoke first.

He drew a sharp breath. "Regardless, I brought Evelyn on this trip. Her condition is my responsibility tonight. If anything happens to her, the blame falls on me."

His icy glare shifted to Ethan. "Why are you still here? Go find her."

Ethan hesitated only a moment before hurrying off. Diana clenched her teeth in silence.

"You treat your employees so well..."

"Not well enough." Daniel's tone was glacial. "If I did, she wouldn't be in this state after drinking for me."

His flat stare pinned Diana in place. "Let this be the last time. Remember - no pressuring staff to drink, ever again."

Diana nodded meekly, pressing her face against his arm. "I was wrong. It won't happen..."

Daniel exhaled sharply before turning toward the restrooms.

Diana's eyes narrowed to slits.

Her fingers flew across her phone: [Find Evelyn. She's drunk. Send men to... entertain her.]

"Over here!"

"Move, now!"

Midnight jolted Evelyn awake. Moonlight bathed her vision as she blinked up at the sky.

Theodore's back muscles tensed beneath her as he ran. Pounding footsteps echoed behind them.

"Theodore—"

"Quiet." His breathing came ragged. "They're hunting you."

Confusion knitted her brows. "If Daniel's men are searching, why run?"

She'd drunk for Daniel's sake. Surely his people just wanted her safe?

"They brought escorts."

Theodore's voice held grim disbelief. "Six of them. Drunk or not, that's no rescue mission."

The words hit like ice water. Six escorts. The implication burned through her alcohol haze.

Cold fury replaced intoxication. Her fingers dug into Theodore's shoulders.

"Put me down. I can walk."

"Almost to the road." He panted. "My friends are coming."

But as they reached the pavement, a black BMW screeched to a halt.

Ethan stepped out.

The pursuers closed in from behind. They were trapped.

Ethan leaned against the car, studying their pale faces. "Why the hell are you running?"
###Chapter 385

Theodore's icy stare locked onto Ethan. His body shielded Evelyn completely. "Don't pretend you don't know what's really happening! Daniel might wear that perfect gentleman mask, but his true colors are disgusting!"

Ethan frowned in genuine confusion.

Daniel had simply been concerned Theodore might take advantage of Evelyn. That's why he'd sent Ethan to escort her back to the Starlight Grand Hotel where company staff could ensure her safety.

Since when did basic concern become "disgusting"? Just because it inconvenienced Theodore?

Ethan countered sharply, "We're only ensuring Evelyn gets proper rest under professional care."

Evelyn's breath hitched at his words.

'Professional care'? Did he mean those... women?

Her teeth sank into her lower lip as she glanced over her shoulder.

Shadowy figures blocked the alley's exit behind them.

Trapped. No escape in either direction.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. Six years of comfort had made her forget Daniel Blackwood's true nature.

This was the same man who'd ordered her car plunged into the ocean to please Serena Hart.

That night when she'd slapped Diana Hart twice in front of him—she'd shattered his precious illusion. Now he was exacting revenge.

Her heart turned to ice, despair flooding her veins.

How could she ever have loved such a monster?

"Evelyn." Ethan's voice cut through her thoughts as he noted her sober yet immobile stance behind Theodore. "I understand you disagree with Mr. Blackwood's decision tonight, but he had no choice. After six years apart from Mrs. Blackwood, he's naturally more... indulgent with his wife. We've been friends for years—don't make this harder than it needs to be. Come back with me."

Her stomach dropped like a stone.

Drawing a shaky breath, Evelyn met Ethan's gaze. "If we're truly friends, why can't you just let me go?"

Ethan sighed. "Mr. Blackwood threatened to deduct my entire month's salary if I return without you."

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "What then? Will you knock me out and drag me back?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "The thought did cross my—"

His sentence ended abruptly as Theodore's fist connected with his jaw. Ethan crumpled to the pavement, unconscious before he hit the ground.
###Chapter 385

Chaos erupted among the men Ethan had brought. In the midst of the confusion, Tyler held onto Ethan while Dominic signaled a direction to Evelyn. Then, Dominic used his muscular frame to block the advancing men.

Evelyn clenched her teeth. Without hesitation, she grabbed Theodore's hand and sprinted past their car, fleeing desperately into the night.

She had been subtly communicating with Tyler and Dominic through glances during her conversation with Ethan.

Fortunately, Ethan hadn't brought many men. Aside from the pursuers behind them, only the driver and two additional bodyguards—other than Tyler and Dominic—stood in their path.

Theodore ran alongside Evelyn, his breath ragged.

Under the flickering streetlights, he caught sight of Evelyn's long hair whipping through the air. The sight sent his mind spiraling back to that distant afternoon years ago—the girl chasing a kite, her laughter ringing in the wind.

How foolish he had been.
###Chapter 386

Why had he never noticed how much Evelyn's silhouette resembled Diana's...?

Their frantic run ended abruptly when a sleek black BMW screeched to a halt before them. "Get in!"

Behind the wheel sat Benjamin Zeller, Gwen's fiancé.

Evelyn frowned. Before she could protest, Theodore yanked open the door and pulled her inside. "This is the reliable friend I mentioned."

Time was critical. With pursed lips, Evelyn slid into the leather seat without further questions.

Benjamin drove them to an exclusive gated community on the outskirts of Mariner's Cove.

"Gwen and I just moved here," he explained, navigating the winding roads. "It's private. You'll be safe."

As they exited the vehicle, Benjamin guided them through the modern villa's entrance. "Gwen prepared ginger tea. Heard someone needed sobering up."

His gaze turned icy when it landed on Evelyn. "Didn't expect Theodore's drunk friend to be you."

"Likewise," Evelyn retorted dryly. "Never imagined his trustworthy contact would be Benjamin Zeller."

She inhaled sharply, pivoting toward the door. "Thanks for the rescue, but I won't impose further."

Though Gwen had been her closest confidante in Seaview Preparatory, their relationship had shattered after Evelyn allegedly stole Serena's husband.

Their last two encounters had been disastrous. Evelyn refused to inflict more drama.

Theodore caught her wrist. "Joshua's men are combing the streets. You'll be caught within minutes."

Evelyn hesitated. With a resigned sigh, she followed them inside.

He was right.

Daniel's goons wouldn't care about her sobriety if they found her before dawn.

The three-story villa smelled of fresh paint and lavender. Evelyn was removing her shoes when Gwen burst from the kitchen, apron strings fluttering.

"You found them!" Her cheerful greeting died when she spotted Evelyn. "Why is she here?"

Benjamin hung his jacket. "She's Theodore's friend."

Gwen's lips curled. "How impressive, Evelyn. First Serena's husband, now Theodore Allen?"

Evelyn turned to Theodore with a wry smile. "Told you this was a bad idea."

Theodore stepped between them. "Gwen, that's uncalled for."

"Uncalled for?" Gwen scoffed. "Did she consider Serena's feelings when seducing Gregory Blackwood?"

She crossed her arms. "Theodore, I helped you search for Diana because you're a brilliant artist. But if you're friends with this homewrecker, you're no longer welcome here."

Theodore tightened his grip on Evelyn's hand. "What makes you so certain Alice is Diana Hart?"
###Chapter 387

Evelyn Carter clenched her fists as Theodore Allen's words hung in the air.

"Master Allen," she said through gritted teeth, "are you seriously suggesting that Evelyn and Diana Hart aren't the same person? Just because of this woman?" Her voice dripped with disbelief. "I shared a desk with her for three years in high school. Do you think I wouldn’t recognize my own best friend?"

Theodore smirked, crossing his arms. "Then tell me, Gwen. Other than her face, what proof does Diana have that she’s actually Evelyn Carter?"

His question made Gwen Donovan falter. Behind him, Evelyn’s entire body went rigid.

Theodore’s confidence was unsettling.

It was as if he already knew the truth—that Diana wasn’t Evelyn at all. When Evelyn had spoken to Oliver Carter earlier, he’d assured her that Theodore only had suspicions. But now? He sounded certain.

Had he figured it out?

Evelyn instinctively tried to pull her hand free, but Theodore tightened his grip. He turned to her, his voice low. "I know everything."

Her breath hitched.

Everything?

How?

He couldn’t possibly—

"Besides her face," Gwen interjected coldly, "Daniel Blackwood is proof. He’s her husband. Are you saying a man wouldn’t recognize his own wife?"

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

Oh, but some husbands absolutely wouldn’t.

Theodore’s lips curved. "And what if Daniel is wrong?"

He tilted his head, studying Gwen. "When you met Diana, did you bring up anything from high school? How did she respond?"

Gwen hesitated.

The truth was, Diana had claimed memory loss from an accident years ago. She couldn’t recall their shared past—not even Gwen’s name until she’d reminded her.

At the time, Gwen had been hurt. But now…

Her gaze flicked to Evelyn, suspicion creeping in.

"What are you implying?" Gwen demanded.

Theodore chuckled. "Don’t you think the woman behind me feels more like Evelyn Carter than Diana ever did?"

Evelyn shut her eyes.

He was determined to expose her.

She stood frozen, torn between stopping him and letting the truth spill.

Gwen had been her closest friend. They’d lost touch after graduation, but seeing her now—defending an imposter, attacking her—Evelyn’s chest ached.

Gwen still cared. That much was obvious.

And after years of hiding, of only confiding in Grace Thornton, facing Gwen and Benjamin Zeller again was overwhelming.

Should she tell them?

Gwen and Benjamin exchanged glances before turning to Evelyn.

After a long pause, Gwen’s voice trembled. "You… you’re Evelyn, aren’t you?"

Evelyn’s vision blurred.

She turned away, fighting tears. "No."

"You are." Gwen stepped closer. "I only told Evelyn about my crush on Benjamin."

Benjamin nodded slowly. "And I only told her I liked Gwen."

Gwen’s voice hardened with certainty. "No one else knew."
###Chapter 388

Evelyn inhaled sharply before launching herself at Gwen, wrapping her arms around her friend in a tight embrace.

"I should have known! I should have recognized you sooner!"

Tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks as Gwen gently patted her back. "Promise me you'll keep this secret?" Gwen whispered.

Gwen nodded vigorously, her own tears flowing freely. "Of course! Ben and I won't breathe a word to anyone!"

Pulling back slightly, Gwen studied Evelyn's unfamiliar yet perfect features. "But... why the new face?"

A bittersweet smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Because I fell for someone I was never supposed to love."

"Come inside," Gwen urged. "Let's have tea."

Ben, equally thrilled, quickly prepared the drinks and ushered them all to the sitting area.

The night stretched on as the two women talked. It wasn't until 3 AM that exhaustion finally claimed Gwen, sending her upstairs to bed.

Evelyn and Theodore were given separate guest rooms on the third floor, each with its own balcony.

Restless, Evelyn stepped outside under the starlit sky. To her surprise, Theodore stood at the adjacent balcony, separated only by a railing.

After exchanging quiet greetings, Evelyn voiced the question that had haunted her all evening. "How did you realize I was—"

"You told me yourself," Theodore cut in smoothly. "You're terrible with alcohol. Got drunk and started calling for Daniel."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. She'd always been careful with drinking, limiting herself to avoid such slip-ups.

Aside from Eleanor Blackwood's birthday celebration, this was only the second time she'd lost control.

Last time, she'd been fortunate. This time... not so much.

"Don't accept drinks from strangers," Theodore advised, his gaze fixed on the constellations. "If you're pressured, call me. They don't call me the unshakable drinker for nothing."

Studying his profile, Evelyn let out a soft laugh before turning her own eyes skyward. "Thank you."

Had Theodore not intervened that night... She shuddered to think what might have happened if Daniel had discovered her intoxicated.

"No thanks needed." Theodore's lips curved. "I should be thanking you. You helped me find the girl from the painting."

He turned to face her fully. "I always suspected there was more to you. Now I see—you're not just mysterious, but incredibly strong. A survivor. And a wonderful mother."

Evelyn closed her eyes, smiling silently.

They remained there, bathed in starlight, until dawn painted the horizon. Only then did they retreat to their rooms.

At around 10 AM, urgent knocking jerked Evelyn from sleep.

"Evelyn!" Gwen's panicked voice came through the door. "Wake up! Daniel's here!"

The name acted like ice water. Evelyn bolted upright and yanked the door open. "What's happening?"

"Daniel's gone mad!" Gwen's hands trembled. "He's hired every major gang in Mariner's Cove to hunt for you! There's a million-dollar bounty on your location!"

Gwen swallowed hard. "Someone told him you're here with Theodore. He's downstairs right now... He took Ben hostage. Says if you don't surrender yourself immediately..."

Her voice broke. "He'll kill Ben with his bare hands."
###Chapter 389

Evelyn felt like she'd been plunged into freezing water.

Gwen clutched her wrist, voice trembling. "Evelyn... maybe you should go downstairs? Daniel wasn't joking. Benjamin—"

Evelyn stared at her friend, but the words sounded distant, muffled.

She'd expected Daniel's anger over her escape. But this?

This was beyond anything she'd imagined.

He'd mobilized Mariner's Cove's most dangerous syndicates. Put a price on her head. Now he sat in Gwen's living room, using Benjamin as collateral.

Why such extreme measures? Was her fleeing last night truly worth this level of retaliation?

Her teeth sank into her lower lip.

After a steadying breath, she squeezed Gwen's hand. "It's fine. I'll..."

Her reflection in the hallway mirror showed disheveled hair, pale cheeks.

"I'll freshen up first. Go tell Daniel I'm coming down. Make sure he doesn't harm Benjamin."

Gwen's worried gaze searched Evelyn's face. "What if he takes you? What then?"

A hollow laugh. "He won't hurt me. This is about Diana. Always Diana."

As Gwen descended, Evelyn crept to the banister, peering below.

The scene stole her breath.

Black-clad men choked the living room with their presence, shadows swallowing the light.

Daniel lounged on the sofa like a king holding court—all lazy arrogance and icy dominance.

Before him, Benjamin knelt, forced down by two enforcers. A dark pool spread beneath his injured leg.

The metallic tang of blood reached Evelyn's nostrils.

Her grip on the railing turned bone-white.

Daniel Blackwood.

When that man unleashed his cruelty, the depths shocked even her.

All this because drunken Evelyn had slapped his precious Diana twice?

He wanted revenge? Wanted to humiliate her with hired escorts?

Not if she humiliated him first.

Back in the bedroom, she scrubbed her face, let her hair cascade loose. Gwen's makeup became her armor—smoky eyes, crimson lips.

Then came the final touch.

Off came her clothes.

Silk lingerie. A blood-red trench coat left scandalously open.

The mirror showed legs that once made Daniel lose control.

She'd use every weapon she had.

Footsteps echoed as she descended.

The silence grew heavier with each step.

Daniel's gaze lifted slowly—then froze.

Red heels clicked against hardwood.

Endless legs flashed through the coat's slit.

His jaw tightened.

Evelyn smiled. Let him look. Let him remember what he'd thrown away.
###Chapter 390

Daniel Blackwood's expression darkened as his piercing gaze swept over Evelyn Carter.

The shadows beneath her eyes betrayed her sleepless night, but thankfully, she appeared unharmed.

A barely perceptible breath escaped his lips.

"Evelyn."

Gwen Donovan knelt on the hardwood floor, arms wrapped protectively around Benjamin Zeller. Tears streaked her face as she stared at Evelyn with swollen eyes.

Blood continued to seep from Benjamin's wounded leg.

Evelyn pressed her lips together before meeting Daniel's stare head-on.

"Mr. Blackwood, you wanted me here. Now I am. There's no need to involve them further."

Her eyes flickered to the crimson pool staining the floorboards. "He needs medical attention."

Gwen bit her lower lip, casting a fearful glance toward Daniel.

Without his explicit permission, she wouldn't dare tend to her husband's injuries.

Daniel studied Benjamin's ashen face, then Gwen's trembling form. A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "Take him to Grandview Medical Center."

Gwen hesitated.

This was their home. If they left, what would stop Daniel from doing as he pleased?

Then realization struck. Even if they stayed, Daniel held all the power here.

Wordlessly, she helped Benjamin rise. "Let's go."

Tyler Walsh immediately rushed forward, supporting Benjamin's other side as they exited.

Noticing Tyler, Evelyn's gaze automatically sought out the men flanking Daniel.

Ethan Reynolds stood among them, along with the same security team from last night.

Only Dominic Shaw was missing.

A sharp pain lanced through Evelyn's temples. Memories surfaced - Dominic knocking Ethan unconscious, preventing the others from pursuing her during her escape with Theodore Allen.

Dread coiled in her stomach.

Drawing a steadying breath, Evelyn pushed past the black-suited guards with deliberate grace until she stood before Daniel.

"Mr. Blackwood, such extravagant measures just to find little old me. People might think you're obsessed."

Daniel's eyes flashed dangerously. "You realize you've angered me?"

First, allowing Theodore to whisk her away while intoxicated.

Then, when Ethan came to retrieve her, she'd been sober - yet chose to strike him down and flee again with Theodore.

And now Theodore had delivered her here, to Mariner's Cove where she knew no one, while he harbored questionable intentions. Daniel hadn't slept a wink.

This morning, he'd mobilized every underworld connection in the city, spending a fortune to track her to the Zeller residence.

He barely remembered Benjamin, but Gwen Donovan's past hostility toward Evelyn remained crystal clear - including her involvement in the hidden camera incident in Evelyn's room.

All this worry, all this effort... only to be met with her cold indifference.

As if he were the villain rather than her protector.

"How shall I make amends, Mr. Blackwood?"

A coy smile played on Evelyn's lips as she surveyed the muscular guards. With deliberate slowness, she undid the buttons of her trench coat.

The garment pooled at her feet, revealing porcelain skin.

If Daniel wanted to humiliate her as revenge for Diana Hart, she'd turn the tables.

With calculated seduction, she settled onto Daniel's lap, her voice dripping with mischief. "Will this suffice?"

They'd tried forcing her to choose among escorts. Instead, she'd chosen the most dangerous man in the room.
###Chapter 391

The air in the living room crackled with tension.

Daniel wasn't prepared for Evelyn's sudden boldness. His body reacted before his mind could process what was happening.

His gaze traveled over her porcelain skin and those crimson lips that seemed to burn with defiance. She was standing dangerously close now.

Every eye in the room was fixed on Evelyn.

The security team stood frozen, their expressions a mix of shock and admiration.

No one had ever dared to challenge Mr. Blackwood like this before. And with such... spectacular assets.

Daniel's jaw clenched when he noticed their stares. "Eyes front!" he barked.

The men snapped to attention instantly, facing the walls like disciplined soldiers.

Snatching a throw blanket from the sofa, Daniel roughly wrapped it around Evelyn. "Have you lost your damn mind?"

When she'd been wearing that trench coat earlier, he'd only glimpsed her endless legs.

He'd assumed there would be something - anything - beneath it.

But this...

"I'm perfectly sane," Evelyn purred. She leaned in, pressing her lips to the sensitive spot behind his ear. Her voice dropped to a honeyed whisper. "Mr. Blackwood, weren't you planning to ruin me? Weren't you going to let others have their way with me?"

Her breath was hot against his skin as she continued, "I'd rather give you the privilege. After all..." Her teeth grazed his earlobe. "This wouldn't be our first time, would it?"

Daniel's brows knitted together. What the hell was she talking about?

Logically, he should be questioning her. Demanding to know why she'd strip in front of his entire security team. Asking about these supposed plans to disgrace her.

But his body had other ideas. Blood roared in his ears, drowning out reason.

His hand shot out, gripping her throat with controlled pressure. "Do you understand the consequences of what you're doing?" His voice was rough with restraint.

Evelyn mirrored his action, her delicate fingers wrapping around her own neck. A wicked smile played on her lips. "The question is, Mr. Blackwood... do you?"

Their gazes locked - his dark with intensity, hers blazing with challenge.

The connection was electric.

Without another word, Daniel swept her into his arms. "Which floor?" he growled.

She'd spent the night here. He needed to know where her room was.

Evelyn nipped at his ear again. "Third floor." The moment her teeth made contact, Daniel felt the jolt straight to his core.

In one fluid motion, he adjusted his grip and carried her toward the staircase.

One of the security team stepped forward. "Sir—"

Before he could finish, Ethan cut him off with a lethal glare.

The man shrank back. "But... Mrs. Blackwood is expecting you at the hotel..."

Ethan's voice was ice. "Mr. Blackwood's personal affairs are none of your concern."

The guard's mouth opened, then closed without another word.

When no one was looking, he discreetly pulled out his phone and sent a quick message.

Meanwhile, at the Starlight Grand Hotel...

Diana paced her suite like a caged animal. Daniel had left her without explanation that morning.

All night, he'd been holed up in the study, coordinating with Ethan remotely to hunt down Evelyn.
###Chapter 392

Daniel left Evelyn alone at dawn, taking an entire security team to search for Diana.
He'd mobilized every underground syndicate in Mariner's Cove, all for that woman.
There was even a price on her head now!

The updates from his men kept coming, each more infuriating than the last.
Every new detail made Evelyn's blood boil with fresh rage.
How could such a vile creature exist in this world?

Daniel had already decided Diana Hart was his wife.
So why was that shameless woman still clinging to him?

Her phone buzzed sharply.
Evelyn's eyes widened as she read the message.
With a furious scream, she hurled her phone against the wall.

CRACK!

The impact made Vivian flinch violently in her seat.
After a long silence, the timid girl dared to speak. "Miss... what happened?"

Evelyn's manicured nails dug into the sofa cushions.
"Diana just slept with Daniel."

Vivian's mouth fell open.
After several stunned seconds, she whispered, "Should we... confront them?"

Evelyn's laugh was ice-cold. "And give him the perfect excuse to leave me?"

She knew the truth too well.
Daniel's feelings for her had always been fragile.
His guilt over Diana Hart was the only thread keeping them together.

For six years, that guilt had been her lifeline.
She wouldn't be the one to sever it now.

"But..." Vivian wrung her hands. "How can you just accept this?"

"I'm not." Evelyn's smile turned venomous. "Remember those photos I sent you? The ones of Diana throwing herself at Daniel?"

Vivian nodded.

"Pick the most damning ones. Leak them everywhere." Evelyn's eyes glittered. "Make sure the whole world sees what a desperate slut she is."

"Yes, Miss."

"One more thing." Evelyn rose gracefully. "Find out which hospital Gwen took Benjamin to. I have some overdue visits to make."

Upstairs in the master suite, Evelyn lay motionless on the rumpled sheets.
An hour ago, she'd been ready to destroy Daniel Blackwood.
Now she felt like a broken doll, discarded after his brutal use of her.

The mattress dipped as Daniel settled beside her, cigarette smoke curling around his bare torso.
"Explain what you meant earlier."

Evelyn didn't bother looking at him.
"Don't play dumb, Mr. Blackwood. We both know why Ethan brought me here last night."

Her laugh was hollow.
"Tell me, Daniel. Are you heartless or just cruel? Even if we mean nothing to each other, we've shared a bed often enough. Was hiring those escorts to humiliate me really necessary?"

She finally turned her head, eyes blazing with contempt.
"You overestimate my pride."
Evelyn's lips curved into a smile as she spoke, her voice light and airy.

But beneath that carefully constructed facade, only she knew the icy despair gripping her heart.

Even with full knowledge of Daniel's schemes, direct confrontation wasn't an option. Not when Oliver's life hung in the balance.

One reckless outburst could ruin everything.

So she played the game—flirty, carefree, brushing off last night's events like they meant nothing. After all, the entire household had witnessed them together. Surely Daniel wouldn't dare send her to those escorts now.

Yet Daniel's next move still caught her off guard.

His eyes narrowed slightly, that infuriatingly handsome face feigning confusion. "What are you talking about?"

Evelyn froze. The irony burned—here she was, scrambling to give him an out, while he chose outright denial.

Of course. Playing dumb was far more elegant than her clumsy attempts at damage control.

"Forget it." She stretched lazily, feigning a yawn. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm exhausted. Mind if I catch some more sleep?"

Daniel stubbed out his cigarette, his gaze sweeping the opulent bedroom. "Here? In Gwen and Benjamin Donovan's home?"

His voice dropped dangerously. "Since when did you become so... cozy with them?"

That morning's frantic call about Evelyn being at the Donovan estate had set him on edge. Yet here she was—perfectly unharmed, casually lounging in their guest room after what should've been a traumatic night.

As if they were old friends sharing brunch.

Evelyn closed her eyes. "Theodore introduced us. He and Benjamin go way back. We shook hands, made peace—simple as that."

"That simple?"

"Obviously."

Rolling her eyes, she slid out of bed—still clad in scandalous lace—and shrugged into her trench coat. "If my presence offends you, I'll just—"

"Stop."

Daniel's command froze her mid-step. She turned, one eyebrow arched.

His jaw tightened as he tossed her discarded clothes at her feet. "Dress properly."

With an exaggerated sigh, Evelyn bent to retrieve them, turning her back to him.

The morning light traced the delicate curve of her spine—and the thin, jagged scar marring that porcelain skin.

Daniel's breath hitched. He'd never noticed it before.

"That scar." His voice roughened. "How did you get it?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled on the buttons. That scar—a permanent reminder of the accident no surgeon could fully erase.

For months afterward, even lying down had been agony.

She forced a laugh, turning with a practiced smile. "Childhood tree-climbing mishap. I was quite the tomboy."

The lie hung between them, transparent as glass. But Daniel merely watched as she finished dressing.

"Happy now?" She twirled by the doorway. "Shall we?"

His gaze dropped to her smudged, smoky makeup. "Wash your face first."

Evelyn flipped her hair with a scoff and stalked toward the bathroom.
###Chapter 394

The sound of running water from the bathroom made Daniel Blackwood close his eyes and exhale sharply.

His phone buzzed.

Ethan Reynolds was calling from downstairs.

"Sir, I've looked into it. Theodore Allen is at the police station right now, accusing us of plotting to harm Evelyn Carter. According to him, two groups ambushed them—one from the front, one from behind. They barely escaped with their lives."

A pause. Then Ethan cleared his throat.

"He also claims we hired five male escorts to... assault Evelyn. That we planned to film it and use it as blackmail."

Ethan scoffed. "No wonder he's an artist. His imagination is wild."

Daniel's grip on the phone tightened.

His gaze flicked toward the bathroom. Evelyn's earlier words echoed in his mind.

"You really went all out, didn’t you? Five or six escorts just to get back at me for Diana? I’m flattered."

He pinched the bridge of his nose.

Now he understood why Evelyn had lost control that night—why she’d stripped in public, why she’d taunted him so brazenly.

"Investigate this," Daniel ordered.

Ethan hesitated. "Sir, it’s obviously a lie. We never—"

"What if someone’s using our name?" Daniel cut in coldly.

"Theodore isn’t a liar. And Evelyn isn’t easily fooled."

If both of them were convinced, then someone had been chasing them that night.

"...Understood," Ethan muttered before hanging up.

Daniel pocketed his phone just as Evelyn stepped out of the bathroom.

Gone was the heavy makeup. Yet even bare-faced, she was breathtaking.

Daniel studied her for a moment before turning away. "Let’s go."

Evelyn pressed her lips together and followed silently.

Downstairs, Ethan was already gone.

The bodyguards kept their heads bowed, avoiding even a glance at Evelyn.

She walked behind Daniel, graceful as ever, sliding into the car without a word.

As the engine rumbled to life, she stifled a yawn and let her gaze drop.

That’s when she noticed it—blood soaking through Daniel’s sleeve.

Her breath hitched.

The factory incident flashed in her mind. If Daniel hadn’t shoved her out of the way, that falling rock would’ve crushed her spine.

She bit her lip.

What kind of man was he?

He could save her life one moment, then orchestrate her humiliation the next—all because she’d struck the woman he loved.

"Last night."

Daniel’s voice snapped her back. He cleared his throat. "I did send Ethan to find you."

Evelyn’s chest tightened.
###Chapter 395

Evelyn turned away, her gaze fixed on the window. She couldn’t bring herself to meet Daniel’s piercing stare.

Daniel exhaled sharply, his eyes locked on the back of her head.

"Last night, I—I was worried Theodore would take advantage of you while you were drunk. That’s why I sent Ethan to find you."

Evelyn nearly scoffed.

She spun around, her expression icy. "Mr. Blackwood, is this some kind of joke? You were so concerned about Theodore harming me that you sent Ethan and five escorts to hunt me down, assault me, and take photos—all to defend Diana?"

Her eyes burned with cold fury. "Tell me, Mr. Blackwood, is this how you treat every woman you’ve slept with? Or am I special?"

Daniel’s expression darkened.

His brows furrowed. "I’m explaining the truth. I didn’t hire any escorts. Ethan only took Tyler, Dominic, and a few bodyguards."

His glare was sharp enough to cut glass. "Do you understand me now?"

Evelyn smiled—a bitter, mocking twist of her lips.

"You don’t need to lie. Didn’t I already give you an excuse earlier? You wanted to punish me?"

She tilted her head, her voice dripping with venom. "I repaid you in bed. I even handed you a way out. I would’ve forgotten last night completely if you hadn’t brought it up."

Her smile was cruel, detached. "I don’t care anymore, even though I’m the victim. So, Mr. Blackwood, spare me the lies to protect your precious reputation."

Daniel’s jaw tightened.

Before she could react, his hand shot out, gripping her throat. "Evelyn, have you lost your damn mind?"

His fingers dug into her skin, pain flaring through her. She winced but refused to look away.

She met his stormy gaze head-on. "Yes, I’m insane. Insane enough to let you use my body to soothe your guilt while you plotted against me. Insane enough to give you an escape when you deserved none of it!"

Her voice was glacial, devoid of any warmth she’d once held for him.

Daniel studied her face—small enough to fit in his palm, yet fierce as a wildfire.

When she defied him, she was like a rose plucked at its peak: vibrant, breathtaking, and covered in thorns.

His gaze dropped to her lips, red from their earlier clash.

Without warning, he crushed his mouth against hers.

The kiss was brutal, punishing. Evelyn fought, but she was no match for him.

Even at her strongest, she couldn’t break free. Now, exhausted and aching from their earlier encounter, she stood no chance.

Daniel bit down, drawing blood. The metallic tang flooded her senses.

She gasped, shoving at his injured arm.

He hissed in pain, releasing her instantly.

Evelyn blinked, startled.

Fresh blood bloomed across his white sleeve, stark and vivid.

Daniel didn’t speak, his face tight with discomfort.

Evelyn bit her lip, inching toward the car door.

Her eyes flicked to his wound.

"Shouldn’t you go to the hospital?"

She’d seen the injury yesterday. No matter how despicable he was, he’d gotten hurt protecting her. She shouldn’t have made it worse.
###Chapter 396

But…

She'd completely forgotten he got hurt protecting her earlier.

It wasn't intentional.

"Don't worry about it." Daniel's gaze darkened as he studied her. He reached into the backseat, pulling out a packet of tissues.

Evelyn frowned, watching him. "You should wait until we get back to the hotel. A tissue won't clean that properly."

Daniel let out a low chuckle. "I'm not an idiot."

He handed her the tissue. "Clean yourself up."

Evelyn hesitated, confused.

When she didn’t move, Daniel exhaled sharply and turned toward her. He pressed the tissue against her lips, wiping roughly.

The white tissue came away stained with fresh blood.

Only then did Evelyn remember—when he’d kissed her moments ago, his teeth had cut into her skin.

She pressed her lips together, taking the tissue from him to finish wiping away the blood.

A sharp sting made her wince when she touched the wound.

"I was saying—"

As she dabbed at her lips, Daniel's voice cut through the silence, cold and controlled. "I didn’t send Ethan to hunt you down with escorts. I'm not that petty. Slapping Diana doesn’t warrant ruining your life."

His bitter gaze locked onto hers. "Evelyn, do you really think I'm that cruel to you?"

She lowered her eyes, refusing to answer. Wasn’t he?

Out of everyone she knew, he was the only one capable of that kind of ruthlessness.

When she stayed silent, Daniel sighed again.

"Theodore filed a police report this morning. He accused me of trying to take advantage of you while you were drunk. The Mariner's Cove police are treating it seriously—that’s why he’s still at the station giving his statement."

His voice hardened. "But the police aren’t the only ones investigating. I’ll get to the bottom of this myself."

Evelyn looked up. His eyes were unreadable, but something in them told her he wasn’t lying.

Yet last night, the men chasing her had clearly said Daniel sent them.

Theodore had warned her, and she’d heard it with her own ears—his name on their lips.

If they weren’t his men, who would dare impersonate him and chase her through the city?

The car soon pulled up to the hotel.

Stepping out of the elevator, Evelyn immediately headed for her room, key card in hand.

She needed a shower. Time to think. To process everything he’d said.

But the moment she opened the door, Daniel pushed past her, striding inside like he owned the place.

She stood frozen in the doorway. "Mr. Blackwood, this is my room."

He ignored her, unbuttoning his shirt.

Her breath hitched. "Daniel, what are you doing?"

With a sharp glance, he peeled back the blood-soaked bandage on his shoulder.

"Help me change this."

Evelyn bit her lip, hesitating before finally closing the door and walking over.

She grabbed the first aid kit and sat beside him, rifling through supplies. "Shouldn’t your wife be doing this?" she muttered.

Daniel smirked.

"You want me to strip in front of her and show off the marks you left on me?"
###Chapter 397

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson.

Her gaze locked onto the angry teeth marks marring Daniel's left shoulder.

During their heated moment, she'd sunk her teeth into his flesh - punishment for his supposed betrayal. The wound still looked raw.

What had possessed her? Maybe some twisted part of her wanted Diana to see this mark, proof that Evelyn had claimed him first.

But now...

If Daniel spoke the truth - if someone had impersonated him, sent those escorts after her - then she'd made a terrible mistake.

Not only had she initiated their intimacy, but she'd also branded him like property.

If Diana saw this...

Evelyn's stomach twisted. She dabbed antiseptic on the wound with trembling fingers. "I wasn't thinking clearly..."

"Hmm." Daniel's lips quirked. "Your moment of passion means you'll be playing nurse for the next week."

Evelyn nodded. "Of course."

She'd caused the injury. The least she could do was tend to it.

More importantly, if this was all a misunderstanding, she needed to keep Diana from seeing the evidence.

Growl.

The sound echoed through the suite.

Daniel raised an eyebrow.

Evelyn forced a laugh. "I... may have skipped a few meals." Between the drinking and vomiting at the hotel, her stomach had been empty for nearly twenty-four hours.

Daniel reached for his phone. "Ethan? Send up two meals. To Evelyn's suite."

A pause. Then Ethan's cautious voice: "Just to clarify... both for you?"

"One for me, one for Evelyn. Her room."

Silence stretched on the line before Ethan finally responded. "Understood."

As Evelyn secured the bandage, she asked quietly, "You haven't eaten either?"

"No."

Daniel shifted on the sofa. "Morning meetings with the Holloway Syndicate. Then your little disappearing act." His gaze sharpened. "Tell me, how did you end up cozying up with Gwen Donovan of all people?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled. "Is Benjamin...?"

She couldn't forget the blood pooling around his knees.

"Minor flesh wound." Daniel waved a hand. "The Holloways know better than to disobey my orders."

Evelyn swallowed. "You... ordered that?"

Daniel studied her face instead of answering.

"I thought Gwen might harm you," he said finally. "Imagine my surprise finding you drinking tea in her parlor." His lips thinned. "Considering she'd gladly stab you for Diana's sake."
###Chapter 398

"Why did she protect you this time?"

Evelyn turned her face away, unable to meet Daniel's piercing gaze. "I told you, it's because of Theodore."

Daniel's stare was relentless.

The intensity of it made Evelyn feel like her secrets were seconds away from unraveling.

"You really think I'd believe that?" Daniel scoffed. "Theodore may be an artist Gwen and Benjamin admire, but they only became fans of his work because of Diana."

His voice was sharp. "Diana loved his art first. That's why they even know who he is."

Daniel studied Evelyn's expression, searching for any flicker of deception.

"Benjamin and Gwen would never betray Diana over Theodore."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, scrambling for a response. Finally, she exhaled sharply and met his eyes. "You still haven't answered me. Did you send those men to hurt Benjamin?"

Daniel's gaze darkened, unreadable. "What do you think?"

She wanted to say yes—that she believed he was behind it.

But she needed to hear his excuse first. A bitter laugh escaped her. "What I think doesn’t matter. Just like how I thought you wouldn’t force me to drink last night, but here we are."

Daniel stiffened. After a beat, he looked away.

"I didn’t send them."

His tone was cold, detached. "Those men belong to the Holloway Syndicate. Benjamin is a local businessman, the son-in-law of Andrew Donovan. The Donovans have history with the gangs. This was payback."

He adjusted his cufflinks. "I only contacted the syndicate to track you and Theodore down. I had no idea you'd be at Benjamin’s house. Nor did I know about their feud."

Just like that, he washed his hands of any blame.

Evelyn smirked. "Impressive, Mr. Blackwood. You always have an exit strategy."

Her words dripped with sarcasm.

Daniel ignored it. He pulled on his jacket and leaned back, scrolling through his phone.

Silence settled between them.

With nothing else to do, Evelyn picked up her own phone and tapped on a news alert about Mariner’s Cove.

She expected updates about the city.

Instead, she was met with photos—of her and Daniel.

The location? This very room.

The images showed her clinging to Daniel, her hands on his neck, her expression unreadable.

The headline screamed: [Donovan Heiress Gwen Donovan Exposes Daniel Blackwood as a Cheating Scoundrel!]

The article claimed that while these moments were captured, Diana had been right next door.

The internet was already in an uproar.

Evelyn’s vision blurred.

These photos—she recognized them. They were from the hidden camera Gwen and her father had planted.

But Gwen knew the truth now.

So why release them?
###Chapter 399

Evelyn scrolled through the news feed again. Each headline made her chest tighten painfully.

The reports not only named Gwen Donovan explicitly, but also included a damning audio clip.

Her hands shook as she pressed play.

Gwen's detached, clinical voice filled the room instantly. "Correct, I'm the source of the leak. I accept full legal responsibility for releasing those photos. Regarding Evelyn Carter's inappropriate relationship with Daniel Blackwood, I'll hold a press conference tomorrow to clarify everything."

"Tomorrow at nine AM, in the Seaview Preparatory's auxiliary auditorium, I'll address all media. Anyone concerned about Evelyn disrupting Daniel's marriage is welcome to attend. I'll answer every question."

The recording cut off abruptly.

Evelyn's grip on her phone turned white-knuckled.

Gwen had just reconciled with her last night. She knew Evelyn was the same Evelyn Carter from their school days. So why...?

And that auditorium at Seaview Preparatory - their alma mater. That small performance hall held their most cherished memories.

They'd had their graduation ceremony there. Afterward, they'd gone to separate universities and lost contact completely.

That auditorium marked the last place their paths had crossed.

Now Gwen planned to publicly brand her as a homewrecker there, of all places...

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. Her heart shattered into irreparable pieces.

Daniel's mocking voice cut through her thoughts. "Wasn't your friendship with Ben and Gwen because of Theodore?"

He lounged carelessly, scrolling through his phone with one hand. "This is the loyal friend you described?"

Evelyn's teeth sank into her bottom lip. She had no energy left to respond.

Between emotional exhaustion and physical hunger, she could barely function.

She curled into a fetal position on the sofa, her slight frame barely making a dent in the cushions.

Daniel studied her from across the room.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains behind her, illuminating her profile with almost cruel brightness. Yet she seemed to retreat further into shadow with each passing moment.

Her slender frame looked almost fragile. The bruise on her lip from his earlier bite stood out starkly - a violent contrast against her pale skin.

Like a wounded animal, she lay motionless, conserving what little strength remained.

His gaze darkened. Even he found the situation perplexing.

Just hours ago, Gwen had been frantic getting Ben to the hospital. How had she shifted focus to destroying Evelyn so quickly?

When he'd arrived at Gwen's home earlier, she'd bravely blocked the doorway despite her obvious fear. She'd insisted Evelyn wasn't there until his men hurt Ben.

Her protective behavior had corroborated Evelyn's claims of their friendship.

Yet...

People didn't change allegiances this abruptly.

The heavy silence stretched until a knock interrupted.

Ethan Reynolds entered cautiously, balancing two lunch containers in his hands.
###Chapter 400

The tension in the air was palpable. Ethan seemed to sense it too, placing the takeout containers on the coffee table without a word before making a quick exit.

The door clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the food containers. Though they contained all her favorite dishes, her appetite had vanished.

Yet her stomach betrayed her, growling loudly. Emotional turmoil couldn't override basic human needs.

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn pushed herself off the couch and approached the coffee table. As she unpacked the containers, the rich aromas immediately made her mouth water.

She dug in with surprising enthusiasm, the flavors bringing temporary relief from her troubles.

Halfway through her meal, a realization struck her. Daniel hadn't eaten either.

She turned her head slightly, catching his profile.

Daniel lounged elegantly on the sofa, his injured arm resting carefully beside him. His piercing gaze met hers with quiet amusement. "Don't mind me," he said lightly when he noticed her looking.

Evelyn frowned. "You said you skipped breakfast too. Aren't you hungry?"

"Starving," Daniel admitted, raising an eyebrow as he gestured to his bandaged arm. "Unless you think I can manage chopsticks with one hand?"

The memory of his injury returned with sudden clarity. The deep gash would make eating impossible.

"But Ethan could—"

"Unnecessary." Daniel's lips curved into a knowing smile. "You seemed quite capable yesterday afternoon."

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. She quickly looked down, focusing on her food with renewed intensity.

After several bites, she set down her utensils with finality.

Daniel's expectant gaze hadn't wavered.

Accepting the inevitable, Evelyn picked up his chopsticks with careful precision. Her movements were gentle as she began feeding him.

Daniel ate with deliberate slowness, each bite measured and elegant.

The familiarity of the moment sent Evelyn's thoughts spiraling back to their early marriage. When Daniel had been hospitalized from overwork, she'd insisted on preparing all his meals, delivering them personally to his hospital room.

Just like now, she'd fed him with tender care.

Serena had mocked her mercilessly back then, calling her a lovesick fool playing house.

How right she'd been.

Later, when Evelyn nearly died because of their schemes, lying broken in a hospital bed, she finally understood the cruel irony behind Serena's words.

"Where did you go just now?" Daniel's voice pulled her from the dark memories. His brow furrowed as he misinterpreted her expression. "About those photos—Ethan will handle it. And tomorrow's press conference? I have more than enough ways to stop Serena in her tracks."
###Chapter 401

Evelyn froze momentarily at his words.

The bitter memories faded as she regained composure.

She lifted her gaze to meet Daniel's. "We're in Mariner's Cove, not Willowbrook."

Daniel took an unhurried bite, his lips curling into a smirk. "Doesn't matter where we are. I always have means."

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

"Even if you do now, what about later? We can't stay here forever."

She clenched her fists. "Here, I can fight back. But once we leave, they'll drag this up again, and we'll be powerless."

Daniel's expression darkened. "You think the Donovans are a match for me?"

His voice dripped with icy authority. If he willed it, Gwen would never speak of this again—no matter where they went.

Evelyn knew his capabilities.

But—

"I don't want more debts between us."

Her eyes dropped to the bandage on his arm. "This is already too much. Gwen came for me. I'll handle it myself, Mr. Blackwood."

A bitter smile touched her lips. "Unless you want Mrs. Blackwood forcing another drink down my throat."

At the mention of Diana, Daniel's jaw tightened. Silence stretched between them.

Soon, Evelyn finished feeding him.

She disposed of the empty containers before turning back.

"Your wound's dressed. You've eaten. Shouldn't you leave? I need rest."

Daniel rose without a word and strode out.

The door clicked shut.

Evelyn collapsed onto the couch, exhaustion weighing her down.

Gwen's recorded words replayed in her mind—spoken with such conviction.

Yet—

Evelyn couldn't believe Gwen would act this way knowing the truth.

So—

Was this Gwen's choice?

Or was someone pulling her strings?

Grandview Medical Center

Vivian observed Gwen's frantic phone calls with amusement.

"Thirsty? You've been at this for hours."

Gwen glared at her phone. "Two more interviews. Then we're done."

Vivian's smile widened.

"Relax, Gwennie. Keep your end of the bargain—humiliate Evelyn at tomorrow's press conference—and Uncle Andrew walks free."

She pushed a teacup forward.

"He's perfectly comfortable in the Prescott estate's guesthouse. No harm will come to him."

Gwen's grip turned her knuckles white.

Everyone knew the Prescott "guesthouse" was a gilded prison—windowless, guarded, reserved for traitors.

Her father was no traitor.

His only crime? Being leverage against Evelyn.

Gwen finished the final interviews through gritted teeth.

"Happy? Ten interviews plus tomorrow's spectacle. Proof enough of my cooperation?"

Vivian typed a message before looking up.

"Delightful. I'll see you tomorrow."
###Chapter 402

"You'll see Uncle Andrew again soon."

Vivian slipped her phone into her pocket and walked away. The second she left, Gwen's phone buzzed with an incoming call from Diana.

"Gwen..." Diana's voice trembled, thick with tears. "I can't thank you enough for this. You're the best friend I could ever ask for!"

Gwen bit down harder on her lip. "Don't worry about it..."

Diana chattered excitedly for several minutes before finally hanging up.

"Gwen."

Benjamin, still lying in bed, gave her a helpless look. "Are you seriously going through with this? Ruining Evelyn's reputation at tomorrow's press conference?"

Gwen shut her eyes. "I don't have a choice."

Even if Evelyn had been her closest friend in high school, they were powerless against the forces at play.

Diana had Vivian's backing, and Vivian had the full weight of the Prescott family behind her—a dynasty that practically ruled Mariner's Cove.

Crossing them wasn't an option.

Evelyn had dozed off on the sofa without realizing it. When her phone rang, she jolted awake.

Theodore's name flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn, where are you?" His voice was laced with urgency. "I just left the police station and heard people talking about you. I called Benjamin immediately—he said Daniel took you. Are you okay? Did he hurt you?"

"No. He brought me back to the hotel. Can you meet me here?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Benjamin... Did he tell you anything else?"

Theodore hesitated.

"He said Gwen is in a difficult position too."

A frustrated sigh escaped him. "Who exactly is targeting you? Diana? But she's not even from Mariner's Cove. How does she have enough influence to threaten Gwen, a local?"

Evelyn closed her eyes. "I wish I knew."

Gwen wasn't just any local. Her father, Andrew Donovan, owned the most luxurious hotel in the city.

Realistically, very few people could intimidate her.

An image of Vivian Prescott flashed in Evelyn's mind.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip.

In Mariner's Cove, only the Prescotts had the power to make the Donovans bend to their will.

She stayed silent for a long moment.

"I'm on my way to the hotel. Want to meet me in the lobby?" When Evelyn didn't respond, Theodore chuckled. "I don’t want to end up at the wrong room. And I definitely don’t want Daniel’s men stopping me."

Evelyn stood. "Fine. I’ll be downstairs."

She hung up, grabbed her coat, and stepped out.

The moment her door opened, the neighboring suite's door swung open too.

Evelyn turned instinctively. Diana stared back at her, surprise flickering across her face before melting into smug superiority.

"Ms. Carter, when did you get back? I heard you conspired with Dominic to knock Ethan unconscious—just so you could sneak off with Theodore."

Diana smirked, glancing past Evelyn into her room. "Did you come back alone? Where is he?"

Then, as if struck by sudden realization, she covered her mouth with a gasp.

"Oh no. Don’t tell me Theodore saw the news and got angry? The gossips in this city are relentless."

Her smile turned saccharine. "Do you know where he is? I could talk to him for you. After all, my husband Daniel is... extraordinary. I don’t blame you for being tempted."
###Chapter 403

Evelyn had no patience for Diana's petty games.

She studied the woman who was so blatantly trying to provoke her. "If that's how it is, Mrs. Blackwood, you'd better keep a close eye on your husband."

A slow, knowing smile curved Evelyn's lips as she leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Because if another woman steals him away, all your little lies will be exposed for what they are."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked off, leaving Diana standing there, trembling with fury.

Diana's fists clenched so tightly her nails bit into her palms.

That woman was getting bolder by the day.

Down in the lobby, Evelyn settled onto a sofa, her trench coat draped elegantly around her as she waited for Theodore.

The exhaustion from the morning's events weighed on her, and she let her eyes drift shut for just a moment.

"Where is Mr. Prescott today?"

"No idea. His assistant keeps brushing us off, but we can't just take orders from him. It's ridiculous!"

"Boss always does his rounds at noon. For him to skip it—something must be wrong."

The hushed whispers of the hotel staff reached Evelyn's ears. Her brow furrowed.

Andrew Prescott—missing?

Instinct told her his sudden disappearance was connected to Gwen's strange behavior.

She opened her eyes and approached the gossiping employees. After a few quick questions, her suspicions were confirmed.

A man with a rigid routine, suddenly unreachable, with only his assistant giving vague replies?

If he wasn't gravely ill, then something far worse had happened.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and retreated to a secluded corner of the lounge. Her fingers brushed the pendant around her neck, activating it.

"Mommy." Oliver's voice, though young, carried a seriousness beyond his years. "I already know about the situation in Mariner's Cove. From what I've gathered through surveillance—"

A pause. Then, quieter, "Your friend's father is being held in the Prescott family's private prison. That's why she turned on you."

Evelyn couldn't help but smile. "How did you know what I was going to ask?"

"Because I'm always watching out for you."

Oliver sighed on the other end. "Ever since we had to cut contact with Liam and Emily to avoid Daniel's detection, I've been monitoring everything in Mariner's Cove myself. If they can't protect you, then I will."

Her chest tightened.

She gripped the pendant tighter. "Thank you, sweetheart. This helps more than you know."

Oliver, ever the pragmatist, steered the conversation back. "What's your plan now? Your friend is being forced to betray you, but we need to act carefully."

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "Don't you think we should have a backup plan?"

A beat of silence. Then, wary, "You're not thinking of breaking him out, are you? That's too dangerous. The Prescott family's prison isn't someplace you can just walk into. Even if you could get past the locks, the guards—Tyler and Dominic are good, but they're not enough."

Evelyn sighed.

Sometimes, Oliver's level-headedness was terrifying.

She hesitated before answering. "Let me handle this. I have a way."

Before she could elaborate, Theodore strode through the hotel doors, arms laden with bags of fruit.

Evelyn quickly ended the call and moved to greet him.
###Chapter 404

Theodore placed the freshly washed fruits before Evelyn as they entered her room.
"Your move?" His voice held concern. "Benjamin was adamant during that call. They're proceeding with the press conference tomorrow. Vanessa won't back down from sharing your story."

Evelyn turned with a knowing smile. "Expecting me to prepare a rebuttal?"

Theodore hesitated before nodding. "But I don't think you should."

Curling her knees to her chest, Evelyn gazed out the window. "Theo, I need a favor."

Morning arrived.

At Seaview Preparatory's modest auditorium, Vanessa Prescott's press conference commenced as scheduled.

Every seat was occupied.

Journalists grumbled about the cramped space while relentlessly snapping photos of Vanessa onstage.

Perched on her chair, Vanessa stared blankly ahead, her expression unreadable.

Disguised among the crowd, Evelyn clutched the press pass Theodore had secured. She settled into a corner seat.

The earpiece crackled to life. "We've made contact with the Prescotts," Theodore reported. "Local syndicates are assisting. Everything's under control."

"Be careful," Evelyn murmured.

"Relax!"

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn focused on the stage—until a familiar voice hissed beside her.

"Never imagined you'd show your face here."

Diana Hart, equally disguised, slid into the adjacent seat. A single Blackwood bodyguard shadowed her—no sign of Daniel or Ethan.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

Daniel's vehement promise yesterday echoed in her mind—his assurance that Vanessa would be silenced. Yet here they were. Typical Daniel—all talk, no follow-through.

Checking her phone, Evelyn noted the time: 8:40 AM. Their plan hinged on extracting Andrew Donovan before Vanessa spoke.

If successful, the conference would collapse.

The clock ticked relentlessly.

At 8:58, Theodore's voice returned—flat, defeated. "Evelyn... the cell's empty. Andrew's gone."

The world spun.

A microphone screeched. Vanessa inhaled sharply. "Good morning. I'm Vanessa Prescott. Today, I'll expose the truth about Evelyn Carter—"

Eyes squeezing shut, Evelyn tasted bitter irony.

Had she overestimated herself—or underestimated the Prescotts?
###Chapter 405

Theodore couldn't locate Andrew.

The Prescott family must have anticipated someone would attempt to free Andrew Donovan. They'd moved him to an undisclosed location beforehand.

At this point, any effort would be futile.

Evelyn lifted her gaze toward Gwen on stage, her expression unreadable.

Despair clouded Evelyn's eyes.

She had no right to blame Gwen.

To Gwen, she was merely a high school friend from years past.

Yet the Prescott family held her father hostage.

Selfishness was human nature. Evelyn was no exception—everything she'd done was to save Oliver's life.

As Evelyn drifted in thought, Gwen's voice cut through the silence. "I used to despise Evelyn."

Gwen stared coldly into the cameras, her tone sharp as ice.

"When she lived in Willowbrook, rumors swirled about her seducing Daniel Blackwood. Since Daniel was married to my former classmate Diana Hart, I judged Evelyn harshly from the start."

The room tensed. Reporters leaned forward, hanging on Gwen's every word.

Diana crossed her legs beside Evelyn, smirking. "You can still walk away," she whispered.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, silent.

"But—"

Gwen suddenly laughed, her voice softening. "Meeting Evelyn changed everything."

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Gwen's gaze remained steady, eyes gleaming. "She's no homewrecker. Never once did she interfere in others' marriages. She's an award-winning jewelry designer with international acclaim. Her dedication to Blackwood Enterprises? Pure loyalty to Willowbrook—she wanted to elevate our city's jewelry industry."

Gasps erupted. Diana's smirk vanished. Even Evelyn stared, stunned.

The auditorium exploded into chatter.

A reporter finally shouted, "Ms. Donovan! If Evelyn wasn't seducing Daniel, explain those photos!"

Gwen smiled.

She live-streamed her phone to the projection screen. "Here's the uncut version."

With a tap, she unveiled the truth.

The original photos had been cropped maliciously. Gwen's complete set told a different story—Daniel reaching for Evelyn's necklace, Evelyn shielding it protectively, their heated exchange clearly about the jewelry, not intimacy.

The final image sealed it: Daniel lounging on a sofa, examining the necklace while Evelyn sat opposite him, frustration etched on her face.

"These," Gwen declared, "are the real photos."
###Chapter 406

Evelyn watched as Gwen Donovan flashed a radiant smile at the sea of reporters. "This is the truth."

A skeptical journalist raised a hand. "But Ms. Donovan, the photos you released earlier were clearly fabricated. You even claimed Evelyn Carter and Daniel Blackwood were having an affair. How do you explain that?"

Gwen inhaled deeply, then let out a light laugh. "I was being coerced. As for by whom… that’s a revelation for another time. There are still pieces of this puzzle I need to confirm before I can share everything."

She rose gracefully from her seat, bowing toward the cameras. "I owe an apology—to everyone, and especially to my dear friend, Evelyn. I’ve spent years resenting her, targeting her at every turn. Yet despite everything, she never held it against me. Instead, she forgave me and welcomed me back into her life. That means more than I can say."

Her smile was as dazzling as it had been on the day of her debutante ball.

"I chose this venue for a reason. This is where I celebrated my coming-of-age ceremony. Back then, my best friend and I made a vow—to embrace adulthood with responsibility. Today, I’ve honored that promise."

Evelyn, seated in the audience, clenched her fists.

She had no idea what was going through Gwen’s mind, but the words struck deep.

After all these years of silence, Gwen still remembered their childhood oath.

Evelyn shut her eyes briefly.

When Gwen had selected this location for the press conference, she must have already decided to come clean.

But even now, Andrew Donovan remained in the Prescott family’s clutches.

The courage it must have taken to defy them and reveal the truth…

"Ms. Carter?"

A man beside her suddenly leaned in, recognition flashing in his eyes. "You’re Evelyn Carter, aren’t you? I can’t believe you’re actually here!"

His exclamation sent a ripple through the crowd.

Every head turned toward her.

Diana Hart, seated beside Evelyn, instinctively lifted a newspaper to shield her face—but it was too late.

The room erupted.

Evelyn and Diana had no choice but to stand.

"Ms. Carter, you’re here with Mrs. Blackwood? Does this mean the rumors about your strained relationship are false?"

"Mrs. Blackwood, the internet claims your husband ended things with Ms. Carter. Care to comment?"

The questions came rapid-fire.

Evelyn frowned, unwilling to engage, but Diana’s eyes gleamed with mischief.

Without hesitation, she laced her fingers through Evelyn’s and raised their joined hands. "We’re on excellent terms. She’s the brilliant lead designer at Blackwood Enterprises, and I’m the CEO’s wife. Of course we’re close."

She gestured toward the projected images onstage. "As for those photos? My husband adored that necklace design. He wanted one made for me, so he playfully snatched hers to examine it."

Diana turned a radiant smile toward the cameras. "If we weren’t friends, why would my husband invite Evelyn on business trips? He’d never travel with another woman without my approval. Our marriage is stronger than ever."

A female reporter shot to her feet. "Then how do you explain last night’s incident, Mrs. Blackwood? Multiple sources claim you conspired with outsiders to force Ms. Carter to drink!"
###Chapter 407

Evelyn's face darkened instantly.

Her brows knitted together as she glared at the female reporter with icy hostility. "I never forced Diana to drink. Where did you get that ridiculous idea?"

The reporter smirked, unfazed by Evelyn's sharp tone. "So you're denying it happened?"

She tilted her head. "Funny, because multiple witnesses say otherwise."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously.

This woman had clearly done her homework.

Time to switch tactics. "Of course it happened."

She grabbed Diana's hand with exaggerated affection, squeezing tight. "Diana and I are best friends. It was just a harmless prank between us. When she got drunk last night, my husband even sent people to search for her."

Diana recoiled at the unwanted contact.

She tried pulling away, but Evelyn's grip was like a vise.

The reporter frowned, about to speak, when the media frenzy erupted.

Camera flashes exploded as journalists swarmed them. "Who knew you two were this close! All those rumors were lies!"

"Mrs. Blackwood is so gracious and kind-hearted!"

"Such a perfect couple!"

Diana felt bile rise in her throat.

She knew the truth - if Gwen hadn't changed her testimony, Evelyn would've destroyed her completely.

Yet here Evelyn stood, playing the saint while still clinging to her hand.

Diana bit her lip until she tasted blood.

Evelyn wore the same angelic face as five years ago, but her cruelty matched Serena's.

As reporters finally began dispersing, Gwen stepped forward.

"Wait."

Her voice trembled. "You've forgotten something important."

A journalist waved her off. "We got our headline. Who cares about your sob story?"

The insult burned.

Diana wrenched her hand free. "So journalism means chasing gossip while ignoring actual crimes? Gwen was threatened into false testimony, and you don't care?"

The crowd hesitated.

Finally, someone sighed. "Fine. Who threatened you, Gwen?"

Gwen paled but stood straighter. "The person who held my father's life over my head to frame Evelyn was—"

BANG!

The doors burst open.

A disheveled Andrew Donovan rushed in, dragging Gwen offstage. "My daughter's clearly confused! This was all a misunderstanding!"

He shot Gwen a warning glare before addressing the crowd. "No threats occurred. Just youthful high jinks between friends!"

Diana's gaze snapped to the entrance.

Daniel Blackwood stood there, immaculate as always.

Their eyes met. He smirked, tapping his phone.

Hers buzzed instantly.
###Chapter 408

Daniel's message lit up Evelyn's phone screen.
[The Prescotts transferred Andrew this morning. Ethan and I tailed them the whole time. He's safe now. I'll take care of the rest.]
[This ends here.]

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she reread the last line. This ends here.

Gwen's father had been imprisoned, nearly lost forever. Gwen herself had almost become a patricide.
Evelyn had nearly been destroyed in the process.

And all of it was dismissed with Daniel's casual text—This ends here.

She stood frozen, watching Diana rush toward him, clinging to his arm with that familiar, possessive ease.

Each time she saw them together, it felt like a knife twisting deeper into her chest.

Daniel had always been indulgent with Diana. Protective. Devoted.

But who was Evelyn? Nothing. Then. Now. Always.

She didn’t dare wonder—if she returned as Evelyn Carter, just as Diana had, would he treat her the same?

She already knew the answer.

Daniel could love many women. He could even love the woman who stole her name, her face.

But he would never love her. No matter who she became.

The weight of that truth pressed down until her vision blurred.

Evelyn didn’t move until the auditorium emptied, until the janitor finally shooed her out.

"Young lady, problems don’t solve themselves by crying!"

She hadn’t even realized she was crying.

Six years ago, after the accident, she’d sworn never to shed another tear for Daniel Blackwood.

Yet here she was.

"Evelyn."

Gwen’s voice snapped her back.

"No one could reach you. Theo said you vanished. I figured you’d be here." Gwen squeezed her icy hands. "You’re crying?"

Evelyn wiped her face roughly. "Is your father okay?"

"Thanks to Daniel." Gwen sighed. "Dad explained everything. Daniel knew Vivian was behind it, but the Prescotts and Blackwoods have ties. He had to save face for them. That’s why he stopped me from exposing her."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn. "How considerate. He cares about everyone’s feelings—except mine."

Her phone buzzed. Ethan.

"Mr. Blackwood says you’re expected at the Prescott family dinner tonight."

Evelyn’s lips curled. "After Vivian tried to make me her husband’s mistress, I’m supposed to break bread with her?"
###Chapter 409

The line went silent for a long moment after Evelyn spoke.

Ethan's voice finally came through, measured and careful. "Evelyn, don't take this out on Mr. Blackwood. He led a team to rescue Andrew Donovan this morning. Without him, the things your friend said at the press conference would have guaranteed she’d never see her father again. Mr. Blackwood had no choice—the Prescotts and Blackwoods have ties. Some lines can’t be crossed."

A heavy sigh followed. "You need to come tonight. If you don’t, you’ll regret it."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone. She wanted to argue, but the call ended before she could.

Gwen studied her carefully. "Are you going?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Yes."

If she didn’t, how else would she see just how far Daniel was willing to go?

Just because the Blackwoods and Prescotts had history, did that mean Vivian could hurt her without consequence? That Daniel could just brush it all aside?

That evening, Evelyn arrived at the Prescott estate as promised.

Gwen came with her. Theodore had wanted to join, but the Prescotts had restricted Evelyn to bringing only one guest.

After some thought, she’d chosen Gwen.

There was a reason.

The Prescott family had nearly killed Gwen’s father that day.

Hands linked, they stepped out of the car and walked toward the mansion.

The moment they entered, they spotted Diana lounging in the corridor, phone pressed to her ear.

She hung up the second she saw them. A slow, knowing smile curled her lips. "You actually came."

Her gaze slid to Gwen. "And you brought my best friend along."

Gwen’s face paled. "Diana!"

"What? Did you forget how you were the one who came to me first?" Diana idly adjusted the flowers beside her. "If it wasn’t your idea to plant that pinhole camera in the hotel room, would I have ever thought of it?"

The words hit like a physical blow.

Evelyn turned to Gwen, stunned.

So that was the truth.

Gwen had been the one to suggest the camera.

It made sense now.

How else would Diana have gotten those photos?

Why else would Gwen and Andrew have shown up together right after Evelyn discovered the camera?

Gwen’s lips pressed into a thin line. She shot Evelyn an apologetic glance before glaring at Diana. "Yes, it was my idea. I took those photos for you. But Diana, back then, I believed you were my friend. You came to me crying, saying someone was ruining your marriage and you needed proof!"

Her voice shook. "If you hadn’t played the victim that day, I never would’ve helped you!"

Diana laughed softly. "Maybe you should explain that better to your real best friend, Evelyn."

Then, as if struck by a thought, she tilted her head. "Evelyn isn’t from Mariner’s Cove. She’ll go back to Willowbrook eventually. But you, Gwen? You’re stuck here."

Her smile turned icy. "I wonder what happens to people who cross the Prescotts."

With that, she strode away, leaving Gwen rooted in place, fists clenched.

Evelyn waited until Diana was out of sight before speaking. "Gwen."

Her voice was quiet but firm. "What do you know about Diana and the Prescotts?"

Because one thing was clear—Diana hadn’t been waiting there by accident.

Her words might have seemed like an attempt to drive them apart, but the real threat had been in that last sentence.
###Chapter 410

Evelyn watched as Diana warned Gwen not to cross the Prescott family.
That could only mean one thing—Gwen possessed something damaging about them.

"No," Gwen denied quickly. "Why would I have anything on them? If I did, would I be the one being threatened?"

Evelyn frowned, confused.

But after a moment, it made sense.
If Gwen truly had leverage, she wouldn’t be the one in danger.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn linked arms with Gwen.
"Let’s go inside."

Gwen exhaled silently, relief washing over her when Evelyn wasn’t looking.
She knew exactly what Diana was hinting at.
The hidden camera had caught Vivian addressing Diana as Ms. Prescott—a slip that could unravel everything.

The Prescott mansion was alive with an extravagant feast.
At the head of the table, Mr. Dennis Prescott raised his glass with a practiced smile.

"Daniel, time moves too quickly. You’ll be back in Willowbrook before we know it. Give my regards to Eleanor and Gregory."

Daniel tipped his glass back with a polite nod.
"Thank you, Uncle Dennis."

Then his gaze shifted to Vivian beside the old man.
"But before I leave Mariner’s Cove, there’s a small matter I’d like your help with."

Mr. Prescott waved a hand magnanimously.
"Name it! If it’s within my power, consider it done."

Daniel set his empty glass down with deliberate calm.
His cold stare pinned Vivian in place.
"I’d like to ask Ms. Prescott—do you have some personal vendetta against my employee, Evelyn Carter?"

Vivian’s face drained of color.
Her fingers trembled as she reached for her wine, gulping it down like liquid courage.

"I don’t know what you’re talking about."

"Good." Daniel leaned back, his smile razor-thin.
"Because I’ve uncovered some… interesting details recently."

Ethan handed him a file, which Daniel slid across the table to Mr. Prescott.
"Take a look, Uncle Dennis."

"First, during our factory inspection, Ms. Prescott arranged for a man named Gavin Whitmore to accompany us. When questioned, he admitted she instructed him to harass my staff."

"Then, at the factory, a massive ore nearly crushed Evelyn. Strange, isn’t it? A Prescott facility, known for its precision, having such a reckless accident?" His voice dripped sarcasm.
"My investigation revealed it was also orchestrated by Ms. Prescott."

The room fell deathly silent.

Evelyn stared at Daniel, stunned.
She’d never suspected any of it was deliberate.

"And that’s not all." Daniel’s gaze never left Vivian’s ashen face.
"That night at the bar, Maxwell Scott forced Evelyn to drink until she was unconscious. She was taken away—saved by a friend."

His voice turned lethal.
"Then, men claiming to act on my behalf brought escorts to her hotel, intending to photograph and blackmail her."
A pause.
"Guess who sent them?"

Vivian’s glass slipped from her fingers, shattering on the floor.

Daniel’s smile didn’t reach his eyes.
"So tell me, Ms. Prescott—what did Evelyn do to deserve this level of obsession?"
###Chapter 411

Vivian's complexion drained instantly. All color vanished from her face.

Her anxious gaze darted toward Diana. Diana deliberately avoided eye contact, keeping her head bowed as she continued eating calmly.

Vivian then turned pleading eyes toward Old Mr. Prescott.

Though visibly displeased, he remained her father in name. He cleared his throat, shooting her an icy glare. "Vivian, is Mr. Blackwood telling the truth?"

Vivian's face turned whiter than the marble walls behind her.

Her lips trembled. "These are all lies!"

She suddenly pointed an accusing finger at Evelyn. "She's setting me up! She's been jealous of my status as Prescott heiress since birth! This is all an elaborate scheme!"

Evelyn's brows knitted together at the absurd accusation.

The irony almost made her laugh. She hadn't spoken a word until now. If Daniel hadn't revealed everything, she wouldn't even know these "coincidences" were orchestrated.

Yet Vivian dared twist the narrative and accuse her?

Evelyn set down her silverware with deliberate grace. Her cool gaze met Vivian's.

"Ms. Prescott, I suggest you choose your words carefully. First, I'm not from Mariner's Cove. Your local achievements mean nothing to me. I've only been here a few days. Other than briefly crossing paths at the gala, we've never interacted. Why would I envy a stranger, let alone conspire against one?"

Vivian's expression twisted with fury.

She scoffed, crossing her arms in a haughty stance. "One glimpse of my life is enough to breed lifelong jealousy! If not envy, why else would you fabricate these accusations?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "I'll concede I lack your... privileged upbringing. But nobility without substance is just an empty title."

She straightened her posture. "I built my reputation from nothing. Through hard work, I became Europe's top jewelry designer. Now at Blackwood Group, I lead the entire design division."

Her piercing gaze swept over Vivian. "As for you? The tabloids paint quite the picture. Beyond your... surgical enhancements, what exactly have you accomplished?"

Diana and Vivian both stiffened. Even Old Mr. Prescott's face darkened.

Evelyn caught herself. She softened her tone with a light laugh. "No offense intended, Ms. Prescott. I merely mean you're hardly worth my envy or scheming."

She took a measured breath. "Furthermore, this is the first I'm hearing these allegations. If you claim to be framed, your quarrel should be with Mr. Blackwood, not me."

With that, Evelyn resumed eating, radiating indifference.

Daniel studied her composed demeanor before addressing the Prescotts. "Evelyn knew nothing. My team uncovered everything—including this morning's incident."
###Chapter 412

Daniel's fingers tapped lightly against the polished mahogany table. "When Ms. Evelyn wanted to expose Ms. Vivian during the press conference, I intervened. Out of respect for the long-standing ties between the Blackwoods and the Prescotts, I chose to handle this discreetly."

His gaze sharpened as he continued, "But if Ms. Vivian insists I'm fabricating accusations, I'll have no choice but to release all evidence to the press. Let the public decide."

Daniel's piercing stare locked onto Vivian. "They can judge whether I'm framing her—or if she's the one targeting my employees."

Silence swallowed the dining room.

Mr. Prescott's eyes flicked between Diana, who kept her head down while eating, and Vivian, whose face had drained of color.

With a furious slam of his palm against the table, he barked, "Disgraceful girl! On your knees!"

Vivian jolted before dropping to the floor. Mr. Prescott's face burned crimson as he jabbed a trembling finger at her. "I warned you—some things aren't yours to take! Yet you seized them anyway, then flaunted your power, thinking the Prescott name made you untouchable in Mariner's Cove!"

Though his words lashed at Vivian, their true target was Diana, still mechanically shoveling food into her mouth. From Evelyn's angle, she could see Diana's knuckles whitening around her fork.

"Effective immediately," Mr. Prescott snarled, "you're no longer my daughter. The Prescott family severs all ties with you."

Vivian's head snapped up in shock. "Father... you can't mean that! I—"

Even as an imposter, she understood the ramifications. If cut off now, Diana would never reclaim her place in the family.

"Enough!" Mr. Prescott thundered. "After your crimes, Mr. Blackwood showed mercy by letting me discipline you privately. Be grateful!"

He gestured violently toward the staircase. "You'll skip this meal. Pack your things—the butler will escort you overseas. You're banished for five years. Since you abused your privileges here, you'll lose them entirely."

Vivian sat frozen before her gaze darted to Diana.

Diana had finished eating. She scrolled through her phone, detached as if this drama didn't concern her.

Drawing a shaky breath, Vivian rose and trudged upstairs.

Once she disappeared, Mr. Prescott exhaled and forced a smile at Daniel. "Does this resolution satisfy you?"

Daniel's lips curved slightly. He turned to Evelyn. "Are you satisfied?"

Caught off guard, Evelyn hesitated before addressing Mr. Prescott. "Sir, one thing still puzzles me."

"Go on."

"Yesterday, my friend and I investigated. Every source confirmed only you could authorize imprisonments in the Prescott estate's private cells—not even your wife had that power." She leaned forward. "So tell me... did you order Andy Donovan's kidnapping?"
###Chapter 413

The dining room fell into complete silence.

Mr. Prescott's face darkened visibly. His icy gaze locked onto Evelyn as he spoke through gritted teeth. "How very... thoughtful of you to concern yourself with Prescott family affairs, Ms. Carter. You're correct. Previously, no one could access our private detention facility without my explicit authorization."

His eyes flickered briefly toward Diana, who kept her head bowed so low her chin nearly touched her chest.

"The situation has changed," Mr. Prescott continued, his voice dripping with frost. "The Prescott family's detention privileges are no longer solely under my control. My daughter now shares equal authority."

He stroked his beard thoughtfully. "As my sole heir, she'll inherit everything eventually. I saw no harm in granting her partial control now. Though I never imagined she'd abuse that privilege in such a... distasteful manner."

Evelyn had anticipated this exact response.

A knowing smile curved her lips as she lifted her teacup. "Then public information is indeed outdated." She took a deliberate sip before continuing. "Mr. Prescott, I suggest you issue a clarification to prevent further... unfortunate misunderstandings."

Her gaze shifted meaningfully to Gwen, whose face had gone deathly pale. "While Vivian was directly responsible for Andrew's kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment, the outside world only sees one truth - that Prescott family detention requires your authorization."

Each word carried deliberate weight as Evelyn continued. "The Donovans have been longtime allies of the Prescott family. Mr. Donovan has sacrificed much for your interests. Surely you'd want to clear your name and demonstrate your innocence? It would be... unfortunate if your loyal allies began questioning where your true loyalties lie."

Her words sent visible shockwaves through the room.

Gwen turned to Evelyn with eyes brimming with gratitude.

Daniel's lips quirked in quiet amusement.

Evelyn's intentions were transparent.

She was building an escape route for Andrew and Gwen - ensuring they could maintain their standing in Mariner's Cove after today's confrontation.

By forcing Mr. Prescott to publicly apologize to Andrew, she'd secured their temporary protection. Any retaliation now would be seen as petty vengeance for Vivian's disgrace.

Daniel studied Evelyn's delicate profile with renewed interest.

This woman continued surpassing his expectations.

He'd assumed she'd use the prison incident solely to humiliate Mr. Prescott.

Instead, she'd weaponized it to protect Gwen and Andrew.

What fascinated him more was the irony - just weeks ago, Gwen and Evelyn had been bitter rivals. Yet after a single night at Benjamin's home, they'd formed this inexplicable bond?

One abandoned her own father's safety to clear Evelyn's name during the press conference.

The other sacrificed her chance for vengeance to ensure Gwen's future security.

His gaze drifted to Diana.

By all rights, she should have been Gwen's closest ally at this table.

Yet somehow Evelyn had become Gwen's protector while Diana...

Diana kept shoveling food into her mouth with single-minded focus.

Noticing his stare, she flashed a vapid smile. "Why aren't you eating, Daniel? Is my face that fascinating?"
###Chapter 414

Daniel smirked. "I expected you to speak up."

Diana shivered slightly.

After a pause, she lifted her chin, offering Evelyn a sweet smile. "If Daniel hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have realized Ms. Vivian had gone to such lengths."

She chose her next words carefully. "Perhaps Ms. Vivian envies Evelyn's brilliance? After all, Evelyn is a prodigy in jewelry design. The Prescott family deals in the same trade. Why would Vivian want to eliminate such a gifted designer?"

Her tone was light, deliberately omitting any mention of Gwen Donovan.

Daniel's brows knitted tightly. The Evelyn Carter he once knew wasn't like this. She had been compassionate, always considering others.

The old Evelyn would have defended the Donovans without hesitation.

Yet now, not only did Diana refuse to help, but when pressed, she only added fuel to the fire.

Had time changed her—or was it something else?

The dinner concluded with Mr. Prescott offering Gwen a stiff apology.

Afterward, Evelyn accompanied Gwen to visit her father.

Daniel, burdened with work, assigned bodyguards to wait outside for Diana before leaving.

Only Diana and Mr. Prescott remained in the dining room.

"I warned you not to overreach."

Mr. Prescott lit a cigarette, his gaze icy. "From the moment you underwent surgery to wear this face, I told you—if you're going to steal someone's identity, you must forget you were ever a Prescott."

His voice hardened. "But look at you. Acting like Mariner's Cove is your domain, using our resources to attack Evelyn!"

A cold scoff. "If not for that convenient scapegoat, how would you have wriggled out of this?"

Diana shrugged, tracing the rim of her glass with a slender finger. "I never imagined Daniel would care so much. He actually investigated."

Even tracked down Gavin Whitmore, the man she'd hired to harass Evelyn.

Just how much did Daniel value her?

"If you don’t want to be exposed, don’t act recklessly."

Mr. Prescott glared. "I’ve made my decision. You’re going abroad for five years. If you can truly become Mrs. Blackwood by then, I’ll disown you. But if you’re exposed, I’ll reclaim you as my daughter when you return."

Diana gave a lazy hum of acknowledgment.

Mr. Prescott exhaled sharply. "For the next five years, the Prescott family has no heiress. You will not tarnish our name."

"I know."

Diana shot him an irritated look. "I’ll behave. I’m only bold now because I have a puppet to blame everything on."

Her lips curled into a sneer. "That fool actually believes she’ll live luxuriously as the Prescott heiress. Pathetic."

Upstairs, Vivian had just learned Daniel had left. She rushed toward the staircase—only to freeze at the railing when Diana’s cold voice drifted up.

Her stomach dropped.

Without a word, she retreated to her room and dialed a number.

"Mr. Blackwood," she whispered. "There's something you need to know."
###Chapter 415

Daniel Blackwood was in the middle of a crucial international conference call when Vivian Prescott's call interrupted.

His fingers hovered over the decline button. For the past twenty-four hours, Blackwood Enterprises had been under relentless cyber attacks from an unknown hacker collective.

These weren't ordinary hackers. Their techniques were sophisticated enough that even Daniel, a cybersecurity expert himself, found them challenging to counter.

The attackers had breached the company's firewall with surgical precision, targeting only the most sensitive corporate data. It felt personal - like someone wanted to bankrupt Blackwood Enterprises overnight.

To make matters worse, Nathan Pierce of Pierce Corporation had seized this moment to launch aggressive business maneuvers against them.

Daniel's gut told him Evelyn Carter was behind this.

Nathan was Evelyn's closest confidant and future fiancé. And the hacker... probably that same shadowy figure who'd been aiding Evelyn all along.

But why target Blackwood Enterprises? The online smear campaign against Evelyn had been Vivian's doing.

Just as he was puzzling over this, Vivian's call came through again.

"Mr. Blackwood," Vivian's voice trembled with barely contained panic, "I need to tell you something important."

Daniel's jaw tightened. "Speak."

He'd never liked Vivian Prescott.

"Please help me!" Vivian's voice broke. "I'm not who you think I am! I'm not the real Vivian Prescott! The true heiress is—"

"Vivian, who are you speaking to?" Mr. Prescott's icy voice cut through the line.

Click.

The call disconnected.

Daniel exhaled sharply. Were they staging some melodramatic plea to avoid Vivian's overseas exile?

Before he could dwell on it, another urgent alert flashed across his laptop screen. The hackers were launching another wave of attacks.

Daniel's fingers flew across the keyboard as he engaged in this digital warfare.

Meanwhile, at Grandview Medical Center, Evelyn sat beside Gwen Donovan as she carefully fed Benjamin Zeller.

The deep gash on Benjamin's leg would take weeks to heal, though thankfully no bones or tendons were damaged.

"You two were always perfect for each other," Evelyn mused, watching Gwen blush as Benjamin gazed at her lovingly.

Benjamin chuckled. "Funny how in high school, I had feelings for you, but you kept pushing me toward Gwen. Back then I thought she was..." He trailed off, smiling at Gwen. "Let's just say Evelyn's judgment was better than mine."

Gwen playfully swatted his arm before carefully spooning more porridge.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Get a room already."

"So what's your next move?" Gwen asked, changing the subject.

Evelyn shrugged. "Same as always. Get pregnant, cure Oliver. Then... we'll see."

Gwen sighed. "When we heard you married Daniel, Ben and I were so happy for you. We thought—"

Her phone rang abruptly. Frowning, Gwen answered. "Dad? What's wrong?"
###Chapter 416

The moment Evelyn heard Gwen's words through the phone, her blood ran cold.

She hung up after a brief silence, her gaze locking onto Serena with unsettling intensity. "Vivian Prescott is dead. She jumped."

Evelyn's entire body went rigid.

Vivian—dead?

Suicide?

She stumbled back a step, her mind reeling.

Just over an hour ago, Vivian had been sitting at the same table with them, eating lunch. How could she be… gone?

"Maybe she couldn’t face the shame of being exiled?" Gwen murmured, shaking her head. "Vivian had too much pride. This kind of humiliation would’ve destroyed her."

Evelyn found it impossible to process.

At the dining table earlier, Vivian had seemed resigned to Mr. Prescott’s decision. She had even gone upstairs to pack. What could’ve changed in such a short time?

The memorial service was shockingly subdued, far from what one would expect for a man grieving his beloved daughter.

The Prescott family claimed it was due to the suddenness of the tragedy—and the scandal.

Evelyn attended with Daniel and Diana to pay their respects.

"You have the audacity to show your face here?"

The moment Mr. Prescott spotted her, his grief twisted into fury. He jabbed a trembling finger at her.

"If it weren’t for you, my daughter would still be alive! You owe the Prescotts a life, Evelyn!"

Evelyn lowered her head. "My condolences."

She didn’t believe she was at fault, but the dead deserved respect. She wouldn’t argue with a grieving father at his daughter’s funeral.

"Condolences?" Mr. Prescott spat. "How dare you stand there and pretend to mourn? What Vivian did to you was nothing! But you had to drag Daniel into it, forcing me to send her away!"

His rage boiled over. Shoving aside the servants trying to restrain him, he lunged at Evelyn, seizing her collar and shaking her violently.

"She jumped because she refused to be exiled! Because of the disgrace! Why couldn’t you just endure it? If you had, she’d still be alive! This is on you!"

Evelyn’s vision swam from the force of his grip. She told herself to be patient—this was a man drowning in grief.

But his words ignited her anger.

Endure it?

If she had, she might not have survived herself. Just because Vivian couldn’t handle the consequences of her own actions, why was Evelyn to blame?

Her silence only enraged Mr. Prescott further.

He raised his hand, ready to strike—

"Enough, Dennis."

Daniel’s voice cut through the tension like ice. He caught Mr. Prescott’s wrist just before the blow landed.

"We all mourn Vivian’s loss. But how much of this is truly Evelyn’s fault? If anything, you failed as a father. Don’t shift the blame."

With that, he shoved Mr. Prescott’s hand away.

Then, his tone darkened.

"One more thing. Before Vivian died, she called me. Said she had something important to tell me—but you interrupted her, Dennis."

His gaze sharpened.

"According to the timeline, she jumped within ten minutes of that call. What happened in between?"
###Chapter 417

Dennis Prescott's face drained of all color in an instant. Diana Hart didn't look much better either.

After a long silence, the older man wiped his eyes roughly. "Daniel, what are you implying? That I would harm my own flesh and blood?"

Daniel Blackwood's expression remained indifferent. "I never said that. I simply want to know—since you were the last person to see Vivian before she jumped, did you notice anything unusual about her state of mind? Or were you too preoccupied to care?"

Dennis's face twisted at the accusation.

"What—what exactly are you suggesting?"

"What I'm saying," Daniel said with a cold smile, "is that Vivian was clearly unstable. Maybe you failed to recognize the signs. You were the only one who could've stopped her, yet you didn't. So don't blame anyone else for her death."

His lips curled slightly. "That's all. We came to pay our respects, not to argue."

Then, without waiting for a response, he turned and pulled Evelyn Carter away, leaving the others stunned in their wake.

Dennis clenched his jaw as he watched them go.

No wonder Diana saw Evelyn as her biggest rival. The way Daniel openly favored her was impossible to ignore.

His gaze flickered to Diana, who stood nearby.

She gave him a subtle shake of her head before stepping forward with a practiced smile. "Uncle Dennis, don't take Daniel's words to heart. He's just protective of his employees."

Daniel didn't stop until he had Evelyn inside the car.

The moment the door shut, his expression darkened.

"I'm sorry," Evelyn murmured, shifting slightly away from him. "I only came because I was shocked by the news. I didn't expect things to turn out like this..."

"It's not your fault."

Daniel cut her off before she could finish. "Vivian's death isn't as straightforward as it seems."

Evelyn froze. She lifted her eyes to meet his. "What do you mean?"

His gaze sharpened. "Like I said earlier, Vivian called me before she died. She claimed she had something important to tell me, but before she could, Dennis interrupted. Then she hung up."

A shadow crossed his face. "At first, I thought it was just another ploy to keep her in Mariner's Cove. I never imagined..."

His voice dropped. "The Prescotts are hiding something. I deliberately brought up that call. If her death had nothing to do with it, Dennis wouldn't have reacted so defensively."

Evelyn was speechless.

After a long pause, she turned to stare out the window. "Maybe you're overthinking it. No parent would... kill their own child. No matter what, that kind of cruelty is unthinkable."

She might not have understood before, but after having Liam, Oliver, and Sophia, she knew—no parent could be that heartless.

Daniel smirked, his tone mocking. "You've never had children. How would you know what a parent is capable of?"

Evelyn stiffened. Instinct made her retort, "How do you know I haven't—"

She caught herself mid-sentence, remembering her current identity.

Clearing her throat, she turned away. "You're right. I've never had children."

Daniel studied her for a long moment, suspicion flickering in his eyes.

Finally, he let out a cold laugh. "There's another possibility."

"What?"

"That wasn't the real Vivian Prescott."
###Chapter 418

Evelyn's breath hitched. She stared at Daniel in utter bewilderment. "What are you saying?"

Daniel's gaze sharpened. "The woman who died was a decoy. The real Vivian Prescott is still alive." His jaw tightened. "This impostor bore no resemblance to the Vivian I knew. Not in appearance, not in temperament."

The Vivian from before would have viewed Evelyn Carter as her mortal enemy. Every encounter had been laced with venomous glares and barely concealed hatred.

Yet this time? The impostor had befriended Diana Hart. Their closeness even surpassed Evelyn's former bond with Gwen Donovan.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. "If that wasn't Vivian... then where is she? Why is she hiding?"

Daniel's expression darkened at the question.

After a long pause, he met Evelyn's gaze. "I'll look into it. But I brought you here for another reason." His voice turned businesslike. "I need your help."

Evelyn steadied her breathing and faced him fully. "With what?"

Daniel slid a folder across the table.

"Blackwood Enterprises' servers are under cyberattack from an international hacker. Pierce Corporation is capitalizing on this vulnerability." His knuckles whitened against the desk. "We're being assaulted on multiple fronts."

Evelyn's hands froze mid-reach. She opened the file to find a damage assessment report.

Though the technical jargon eluded her, the financial figures made her blood run cold. The staggering losses nearly made her drop the documents.

"My analysis suggests the hacker is your usual benefactor." Daniel's stare bored into her.

Evelyn's face drained of color. Oliver. "Nathan exploited the situation. Blackwood Enterprises took massive hits because of him."

Her fingers trembled slightly. Nathan always heeded Oliver's advice.

Which meant...

Evelyn pressed a hand to her temple. "If I told you I had no knowledge of either attack, would you believe me?"

"You know now." Daniel's voice held glacial finality. "I'm giving you one chance to stop them. If not..." A dangerous glint entered his eyes. "When I return to Willowbrook tomorrow, their victory will be short-lived. Make no mistake - I have the resources to ensure that."

With Daniel absent from Blackwood Enterprises' headquarters, certain countermeasures couldn't be implemented. That temporary vulnerability had created this window of opportunity.

Evelyn massaged her temples.

There was no denying her connection to this mess now.

"Fine," she conceded.

During her business trip to Mariner's Cove, she'd been too preoccupied to check in with the children regularly. Those little troublemakers had clearly taken advantage of her distraction.

"Theodore told Oliver you were being mistreated," Liam explained when Evelyn called him from her hotel room. The boy's voice brimmed with defiant pride. "If that bastard Daniel was taking you on a business trip, he should've protected you properly. Instead, you nearly died multiple times. We had to retaliate."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Tell Nathan to stand down immediately."

While Pierce Corporation and Blackwood Enterprises maintained an uneasy truce, their mutual dominance usually limited conflicts to minor skirmishes.

This full-scale corporate warfare, though currently favoring Nathan, would inevitably exact heavy tolls on both sides.

Nathan had already sacrificed enough for her sake. She wouldn't let him jeopardize Pierce Corporation's stability over this.

"Uncle Nathan won't listen to me," Liam admitted. "Mom, remember Serena? After she got deported, I asked Uncle Nathan to investigate her. Guess what he found? She's under the protection of someone powerful - someone connected to the Blackwood family!"
###Chapter 419

Evelyn's stomach twisted into knots.

The men guarding Serena were unmistakably from the Blackwood family.

Serena had made multiple attempts to harm Liam and Sophia in the past.

If not for Liam's brave sacrifice by playing along with Serena's schemes, they'd never have gathered proof of her crimes.

Daniel knew every detail of this.

Yet while pretending to punish Serena, he'd secretly sent his own people to protect her overseas?

Evelyn's vision blurred momentarily.

This betrayal cut deep.

"So Mom," Liam's voice crackled through the phone, "Uncle Nathan isn't just retaliating for what happened in Mariner's Cove. He's seeking justice for me and Sophia too."

Evelyn gnawed her lower lip.

Daniel's threat from earlier echoed in her mind: "I'm giving you this one chance to call them off. If you don't, by the time I return to Willowbrook tomorrow, their smug victory will be short-lived. I have the power to make that happen."

She knew he wasn't bluffing.

She'd witnessed his ruthless capabilities firsthand.

After reassuring Liam, Evelyn inhaled sharply and dialed Nathan.

This marked their first contact since Eleanor Blackwood's birthday gala.

She'd deliberately kept him out of her recent troubles.

Nathan had saved her from drowning years ago, nursed her back to health, delivered her triplets, and funded her reconstructive surgeries.

The debt she owed him weighed heavily. That's why she'd refused his help with Oliver's treatment.

She couldn't bear the thought of Nathan clashing with Daniel in the corporate arena on her behalf.

Not that she doubted Nathan's abilities—she simply couldn't stomach adding to her mountain of unpaid dues.

The line connected after two rings. "Evelyn," Nathan's icy tone brooked no argument, "don't waste your breath. My decision's final. This time, Daniel Blackwood will answer for everything he's done to you and the children. From six years ago until now. Since none of you can make him pay, I will."

She pressed her lips together. "Nathan, you're only succeeding now because Daniel's stranded in Mariner's Cove. Once he returns to Willowbrook, his home turf, this battle will cost you dearly. A few hundred million is punishment enough. Please—stand down."

A dark chuckle vibrated through the receiver. "You think I can't handle Daniel Blackwood? At worst, it'll be mutually assured destruction. And trust me—he'll lose far more than I will."

Evelyn massaged her temples. "I understand your anger, but Vivian Prescott orchestrated the Mariner's Cove incidents. With her gone, that chapter's closed. As for the Blackwood operatives protecting Serena..."

She steeled herself. "Send me whatever evidence proves they're Daniel's men. I'll confront him directly."

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, Nathan's bitter laugh crackled through. "After everything, you still care about protecting him?"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"Daniel isn't invincible. And I'm not as fragile as you think."

"If you deny me this confrontation, I'll never find peace."

"Nathan." She exhaled shakily. "I know you've always been business rivals. Battle him all you want in the future—just not over me or the children. So send me the proof, and end this now."

She disconnected before he could respond.

Across town, Nathan stared at his darkened screen, listening to the dead line.

Six years.

Six damn years, and he remained permanently locked out of her heart.

Always the outsider. With a humorless smile, he summoned his assistant. "Cease all operations against Blackwood Enterprises."
###Chapter 420

The documents arrived just as dusk settled over Mariner's Cove. Evelyn Carter studied the files Nathan Pierce had sent, her fingers trembling slightly as she flipped through the pages. Each page contained meticulous details about the security team protecting Serena Hart.

Several faces stood out. She'd encountered some of them before.

Without question, they were Daniel Blackwood's men.

Her stomach twisted as realization dawned. These weren't just random bodyguards - they were Daniel's most trusted operatives. No one would dare protect Serena without his explicit orders.

Evelyn slammed the folder shut and pressed her palms against her temples.

She'd known Daniel for over a decade. Thought she understood him completely.

Six years ago, his betrayal had shattered her world.

Now, after returning to steal from him to save Oliver, she realized she still didn't truly know him. Daniel Blackwood remained an enigma she could never solve.

"Evelyn?"

Gwen Donovan's voice snapped her from her thoughts. The knock at her hotel room door grew more insistent.

Evelyn forced herself to compartmentalize. Tomorrow she'd leave Mariner's Cove with Daniel. This bizarre business trip would finally end.

She might never see Gwen again. They needed a proper goodbye.

Pasting on a smile, Evelyn opened the door.

With Benjamin's injured leg, their farewell dinner became a girls' night. Gwen took her to their old high school haunt - a bustling food stall near Seaview Preparatory.

The place buzzed with energy, just like their teenage years.

Gwen poured wine with shaking hands. "After all these years of friendship... I nearly betrayed you." She raised her glass with a bitter smile. "This one's for my shame."

Evelyn grabbed her juice glass. "Stop. You risked your father's life to help me. That's not betrayal."

Gwen's lips quivered. She opened her mouth, then closed it again.

The wine disappeared in one gulp.

Truth was, she'd only dared expose Serena at the press conference after receiving Daniel's message confirming her father's safety.

And that other secret...

The way Vivian Prescott had addressed Diana Hart as "Ms. Prescott."

She couldn't tell Evelyn. Not after what happened to Vivian.

Would she be next?

Gwen drank like someone trying to drown their conscience.

At first, Evelyn thought it was just farewell sadness. Then she noticed Gwen's haunted expression.

"I'm sorry, Evelyn."

Gwen repeated the phrase all the way home, slurring slightly.

"For what?" Evelyn steadied her wobbling friend.

"For keeping secrets." Gwen's laugh turned into a sob.

When they reached Gwen's apartment, the drunken woman shoved an envelope into Evelyn's hands.

"My... love letter. Read it in Willowbrook."

Evelyn pocketed the strange gift with an uneasy chuckle. She waited until Gwen stumbled inside safely before hailing a cab.

"Your friend had quite the night," the driver remarked as Evelyn slid into the backseat. "It's a long ride to your hotel. You should rest - you look exhausted."

"I'm fine," Evelyn insisted.

Then inexplicable drowsiness hit like a wave. Her eyelids grew heavy. The world blurred.

As consciousness slipped away, she barely registered the cab turning in the wrong direction.

The driver's grin widened in the rearview mirror.
###Chapter 421

Evelyn drifted in and out of consciousness, trapped in a nightmare she couldn't escape.

In her dream, rough hands yanked her from the car while she was still unconscious.

Her eyelids felt like lead weights, but she could feel the gravel scraping against her bare legs. The sharp pain told her skin was tearing, blood trickling down her shins.

Muffled male voices surrounded her. Though she couldn't make out the words, two chilling phrases cut through the haze: "rape" and "kill."

She fought to open her eyes, but her body refused to obey.

A sudden shock of ice-cold water jolted her awake.

Blinking through the stinging water, Evelyn realized with dawning horror that this was no dream.

The abandoned factory reeked of rust, gasoline, and damp decay. Her wrists and ankles burned from the coarse ropes binding her to the metal chair.

Dim fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting long shadows across the concrete floor.

Three hulking men loomed before her, their grins predatory. Behind them sat a smug middle-aged man, casually photographing the contents of an opened letter.

After sending the image, he lit the letter with a match, watching the flames consume the paper before turning his attention to Evelyn.

"Recognize me, girl?"

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip. Ignoring the throbbing pain in her legs, she forced her voice steady. "Victor Holloway. Leader of Mariner's Cove's most powerful syndicate."

Victor's eyebrows shot up. The client had told him this was some Willowbrook socialite who wouldn't know the first thing about the underworld.

"You're the Butcher of Harborview Bridge," Evelyn continued. "You kill for pleasure, not profit. No one hires you - you work for yourself alone."

Her chin lifted as she met his gaze head-on. "So why break your rule for me? What did I ever do to you?"

Victor chuckled, stroking his stubbled jaw. "Not breaking rules, sweetheart. Just settling an old debt."

Evelyn's mind raced. Victor had been syndicate boss for over a decade. Whoever called in this favor must have helped him before his rise to power.

Then it clicked. Mr. Prescott had bailed Victor out during his early gang days. That explained how the Prescotts maintained their iron grip on Mariner's Cove's shipping lanes.

"Andrew Prescott," Evelyn spat. "Trading my life for his daughter's?"

Victor's eyes narrowed. "Clever little thing, aren't you?"

He gestured to his men. "Finish it. The less she knows, the better."

The men exchanged glances before whispering to their boss. Victor smirked and waved a dismissive hand. "Have your fun. Just make it quick."

One thug produced a bottle of whiskey while another grabbed Evelyn's hair, forcing her head back. She thrashed against her restraints as the burning liquid poured down her throat and over her body.

The alcohol seared her open wounds. When the bottle emptied, rough hands groped her face and neck. "Fight all you want, princess. Makes it more fun."

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut.

The emergency necklace Oliver gave her remained inactive. He'd never know what happened here.

And Gwen... Gwen was in no state to help anyone.
###Chapter 422

Daniel hadn't contacted her since that morning.

Theodore…

Even now, she couldn’t stop thinking about Theodore.

He wouldn’t even know about this. And even if he did, he wouldn’t come to save her.

The thought made tears spill down her cheeks.

She didn’t want to die. Not yet. Not before finding a cure for Oliver. She refused to die like this!

But what could she do?

Victor was repaying a debt. He didn’t want money. What else could she offer him?

Nothing.

Evelyn closed her eyes in defeat. Maybe this was fate…

BANG!

Just as the men reached for her with their filthy hands, a deafening crash echoed through the abandoned factory.

Victor shot to his feet. "Stop!"

The men froze. "Boss, what’s wrong?"

"That sound—something’s off!"

Victor’s brow furrowed. Before he could say more, a black Hummer smashed through the factory doors.

Behind the wheel was none other than Sebastian Kane—leader of Mariner’s Cove’s second-largest syndicate.

And in the passenger seat sat Theodore, his gaze icy.

The moment the Hummer crashed inside, dozens of armed men swarmed in after it.

Victor paled. He’d walked right into a trap.

He tried to rally his men, but they were too drunk from forcing alcohol down Evelyn’s throat.

Only he was sober.

"Victor, still trying to fight?" Sebastian stepped out of the Hummer, smirking.

"Did you really think you could handle a woman alone? Never crossed your mind we’d be waiting, did it?"

Victor’s jaw clenched. "How did you find me?"

Sebastian scoffed. "Mr. Blackwood couldn’t reach his friend. Figured something was wrong."

"She pissed off the Prescotts today, and you’re their lapdog. Of course we came looking."

Victor’s eyes flicked to Theodore, who ignored the gang confrontation entirely.

Theodore strode toward Evelyn, his expression unreadable.

Seeing her injuries, the way she trembled, soaked in alcohol—his chest tightened.

He shrugged off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. Carefully, he cut the ropes binding her.

"Theodore…"

Evelyn was drunk, her vision swimming. She clutched his arm weakly. "You promised… no more drinking. Said I wouldn’t have to drink for you again. Liar. I hate you."

Her voice was slurred, soft.

Theodore exhaled sharply and pulled her close. "Yeah. I broke my promise."

Evelyn rested her head against him, murmuring, "How long… until you love me?"

Theodore went still.

Suddenly, he was back in the past—the year he’d married Evelyn Carter.

She’d insisted on seeing the world with him, foolishly drinking in his place.

Later, drunk just like this, she’d clung to his arm and asked the same question: "How long until you love me?"

Her voice, her mannerisms—identical to the woman in his arms now.

Theodore swallowed hard, brushing his thumb over her lips. "If only you were her…"
###Chapter 423

The abandoned factory was in complete disarray.

Sebastian Kane barked orders at his men to restrain Victor Holloway while turning to glare at Daniel Blackwood, who carried Evelyn Carter in his arms.

Daniel's broad frame moved steadily toward the exit, his grip on Evelyn unyielding.

Sebastian frowned. "Daniel, you're just walking away?"

Daniel paused. "Is there something else?"

"Come on," Sebastian chuckled, lighting a cigarette with a flick of his wrist. His grin was all sharp edges. "You handed Victor to me on a silver platter. Don't you want anything in return?"

"No." Daniel exhaled, glancing down at Evelyn trembling against his chest. "I only came for her."

Then he strode out without another word.

Sebastian took a long drag, watching him leave before turning to his right-hand man. "He said she's just an employee, right?"

The man nodded. "Yeah."

"And he's married?"

"Years now."

Sebastian blew out a smoke ring, amused. "Fascinating."

The sterile lights of Grandview Medical Center hummed overhead.

"Not life-threatening," the doctor announced after examining Evelyn. "She was forced to drink—severe intoxication. The alcohol also aggravated the cuts on her legs. We'll administer IV fluids. She'll recover once she wakes."

Then he shot Daniel a disapproving look. "Partying is fine, but know your limits. If something worse had happened, you'd be responsible for her forever."

Daniel's lips thinned. He smirked darkly. "If something worse had happened—"

"Daniel, is Evelyn okay?"

A voice sliced through the tension.

Diana Hart stood before him in a tailored red coat and knee-high boots, her makeup immaculate—every lash curled, every contour precise.

She had clearly taken her time getting ready before arriving.

Daniel's jaw tightened.

When Evelyn hadn’t answered her phone, Diana had insisted she was probably just drunk with Gwen. She’d spun excuse after excuse.

Only when Ethan Reynolds found Gwen unconscious in her own home did the severity of the situation become clear.

Yet Diana had still primped before showing up.

He’d always known she and Evelyn didn’t get along, but tonight, every calculated move of hers turned his stomach.

"Nothing critical," the doctor interjected, sensing the tension. "Just alcohol poisoning. She’ll be fine after rest."

Diana’s gaze flicked past him to Evelyn on the bed—specifically, to Daniel’s jacket draped over her.

Her fingers twitched.

"Th-that’s it? No other injuries?"

The doctor shook his head. "None."

"You sound disappointed."

Daniel’s voice was ice. "Your optimism delayed finding her. She could’ve been destroyed tonight. And instead of remorse, you’re hoping she’s hurt worse?"

He laughed bitterly. "Diana, even if you hate her—has she ever actually harmed you?"

Diana flinched. Her lips trembled. "Daniel, you’re twisting my words! I’m worried sick!"

She dabbed at her perfectly dry eyes. "I’m from Mariner’s Cove. I know how ruthless Victor Holloway is. When you said he took Evelyn, I—I panicked!"

A delicate sniffle. "He’s capable of anything. I just wanted to make sure the doctors didn’t miss something."
###Chapter 424

"I was worried Evelyn might have internal injuries."

Grace sighed at Diana's words. "I ran every possible test. These are her only visible wounds, but..." She tapped her chin thoughtfully. "It's odd Victor Holloway would show such restraint."

Diana nodded. "I thought the same thing."

Victor had held Evelyn captive for days. By Sebastian Kane's standards, she should've been dead before Daniel arrived.

The idea of Evelyn's demise had put Diana in such high spirits that she'd dressed to impress before rushing over. She'd expected a corpse. Instead—

Daniel's tense shoulders relaxed slightly at Grace's assessment. His gaze drifted to Evelyn, still unconscious with an IV drip, then to his watch.

"It's nearly 2 AM. Diana, get some rest. I'll stay with her. We leave for Willowbrook at dawn."

Diana caught his sleeve, her nails digging in just enough to leave crescent marks. "Daniel, you've done enough. Let me take care of her. This is my fault—if I hadn't stopped you from searching sooner—"

Guilt.

Penance.

Hearing those words from Diana's lips eased something in him. Six years hadn't erased all traces of the kind girl he'd once known.

But he shook his head. "Go home."

"Daniel—"

"Need a third option?"

The sardonic voice sliced through their argument. Theodore Allen leaned against the doorframe, white shirt sleeves rolled to his elbows. Mocking amusement glittered in his eyes. "Why don't you two continue this elsewhere? Evelyn needs quiet. I'll handle watch duty."

Daniel's expression darkened. "You weren't invited."

Theo strode in, dropping into the chair beside Evelyn's bed. "And yet, here I am."

Diana seized the opportunity, tugging Daniel toward the door. "He's right. You have that merger tomorrow. You need sleep."

After a long glare at Theo, Daniel let her lead him away.

Blackwood Estate

Nathan Pierce's hands trembled around his phone. Victor Holloway's empire had crumbled overnight—toppled by an alliance between Sebastian Kane and Daniel Blackwood.

With Victor gone, the Prescott family's downfall was inevitable.

His daughter's stupidity had brought this upon them. If only she hadn't provoked Daniel—

He raised the phone to smash it when a notification chimed.

A photograph of a handwritten letter filled the screen.

[Evelyn, a secret you should know. The Vivian who died wasn't the real Prescott heiress. Diana is. —Gwen]
###Chapter 425

Evelyn slept deeply through the night.

Her dreams were filled with horrors. She saw herself being humiliated by faceless men. Her lifeless body was dumped in some desolate wasteland.

In the nightmare, Daniel and Diana drove past her corpse without hesitation, laughing as they returned to Willowbrook.

She jolted awake with a scream.

"Bad dream?"

Theodore's voice was soft beside her.

Evelyn blinked, disoriented. The sterile white walls and the sharp scent of antiseptic told her she wasn’t at home.

She rubbed her temples and sat up. "Where—?"

"Grandview Medical Center," Theodore answered, pouring her a glass of water. "You were attacked and kidnapped last night. Someone rescued you and brought you here."

He handed her the glass. "Do you remember anything?"

Evelyn took it, her fingers curling around the warmth. "Bits and pieces."

Last night…

After dropping Gwen off, she’d fallen asleep in the cab.

Then…

Her gaze dropped to her body, checking for injuries.

Theodore gently stopped her. "You're fine. They forced alcohol down your throat and doused you in it, but nothing worse happened."

He exhaled. "But if your rescuer had been any later…"

Evelyn bit her lip. The alcohol had left her hazy, but flashes of memory remained. "Last night… was it Daniel who saved me?"

Theodore nodded. "Him."

"We're in Mariner's Cove. He's from Willowbrook—how did he take on the Holloway Syndicate?"

"He got the Kane Syndicate involved."

Theodore smirked. "He’s a businessman, after all. Clever. Once he confirmed Victor Holloway had taken you, he went straight to Sebastian Kane. Offered him a way to take Victor down."

He shook his head in admiration. "Brilliant move. On one hand, Sebastian got rid of his biggest rival. The Holloway Syndicate lost its leader, leaving the Kane Syndicate to rise as the top power in Mariner's Cove."

"On the other hand, Victor owed the Prescott family favors. With him gone, the Prescotts lost their strongest ally. Even if Daniel doesn’t target them directly, their influence is already crumbling."

"Finally, Sebastian gained everything, but now he owes Daniel a massive debt. With the Kane Syndicate in charge, Daniel can operate freely here."

Theodore whistled. "Three birds with one stone. Honestly, I almost wonder if he planned it all from the start. If not, his ability to improvise is terrifying."

Evelyn closed her eyes. "Maybe he did."

Theodore hesitated. "I—I was just speculating."

Her voice was flat. "During the inspection last week, Daniel had a file on acquiring the Prescott jewelry line."

"At the time, I thought it was impossible. Their jewelry division is thriving. But if last night was the beginning of their downfall…"

She met Theodore’s gaze. "Tell me—now that they’re no longer the leading enterprise here, do you think the Prescotts will sell?"

Theodore went silent.

He hadn’t expected his offhand comment to align with Blackwood Group’s strategy. He exhaled. "Daniel’s a businessman. This is just how he operates."
###Chapter 426

"But I doubt he'd go that far." Theodore leaned against the window frame, arms crossed. "Making you a target? If he missed, Victor Holloway would kill you without hesitation."

Evelyn's laugh was bitter, hollow. "Even if Victor kills me, Daniel wouldn't blink an eye."

Theodore's silence stretched between them like a taut wire.

"Daniel cares more than you realize." His voice dropped. "When you were unconscious, he nearly tore the hospital apart arguing with Diana about who should stay with you. That wasn't acting."

Evelyn turned toward the rain-streaked window. "You don't know him like I do." Her reflection blurred in the glass. "My life has never mattered to him."

At dawn, Theodore summoned the Grandview Medical Center's chief physician for Evelyn's checkup. Only after receiving the all-clear did he escort her to breakfast, then back to Starlight Grand Hotel.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Ethan Reynolds.

"Evelyn." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Mr. Blackwood wants everyone packed. We leave for Willowbrook at ten sharp."

She nodded mechanically, brushing past him. The hotel room door clicked shut behind her.

Outside, Theodore's teasing voice carried through the wood. "Got room for one more? My flight's to Willowbrook too."

"Absolutely not." Ethan's reply could have frozen lava.

Inside, Evelyn folded clothes with robotic precision. Something nagged at her—an absence she couldn't name.

"Maybe a gift from your friend?" Theodore called through the door. "You've checked every pocket twice."

Her hands stilled. Gwen's letter. The one she'd risked everything to retrieve from the club.

Frantically, she dumped the suitcase. No cream-colored envelope. No looping handwriting. Just as the car horn blared outside, memory struck—Victor's lighter flickering, orange flames consuming Gwen's words.

The regret tasted like ashes.

This time, Daniel dictated the seating arrangement. Evelyn up front. Him and Diana in back. No arguments.

Diana kicked the seat. "This is ridiculous. The other car's empty except for luggage. Marcus is driving—he's not going to kidnap her."

Daniel's silence was answer enough.

Evelyn dialed Gwen. Once. Twice. Nothing. She checked the time—9:47 AM. Even post-bender, Gwen should be awake.

Benjamin's number rang once before disconnecting. Strange. But maybe service issues in the garage.

Exhaustion won. She slumped against the window, asleep before the highway merged.

Somewhere past the Harborview Bridge, Daniel's phone shattered the silence. His knuckles whitened around the device. The temperature in the car plummeted.

"Gwen's in trouble." His voice was Arctic winter.
###Chapter 427

Evelyn's heels clicked frantically against the hospital tiles as she sprinted toward the emergency wing.

Gwen remained behind those sterile white doors.

Outside stood Andrew Donovan, his face streaked with tears, and Sebastian Kane, his expression unreadable.

Benjamin Zeller—the one person who should've been there—was conspicuously absent.

Evelyn skidded to a stop in front of them, breathless. "Uncle Andrew, is Gwen—?"

Andrew clutched her wrist, his sobs choking any coherent response.

"My people got to her first."

Sebastian's sharp gaze flicked to Evelyn. Last night, he'd been too preoccupied dismantling Victor Holloway's operations to notice much about her.

Now, under the fluorescent lights, he understood why men lost their minds over women like her.

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip. She pulled away from Andrew and locked eyes with Sebastian. "How bad is it?"

"Bad." His jaw tightened. "This morning, my men tracked Holloway's remaining crew to the Prescott estate. Instead of planning a rescue, they went straight for the Donovans."

"I owed Daniel a favor. Knew the Donovans had ties to him. So I had tails on them." A muscle twitched in his temple. "But we were stretched thin today. My guys lost them briefly."

His gaze shifted to the wall. He couldn't bear to look at Andrew's crumbling face. "When we found them..." His voice turned gravelly. "She was unconscious. Beaten. And those bastards were lighting cigarettes like they'd just had their fun."

Something detonated in Evelyn's skull.

Sebastian kept talking, but the words dissolved into static.

Only two sentences looped in her mind:

Beaten until unconscious.

Lighting cigarettes like they'd just had their fun.

Evelyn staggered back. Her knuckles whitened around the strap of her purse.

Those cigarettes meant only one thing.

Gwen had been—

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. A wave of nausea hit her. No wonder Benjamin wasn't here.

He'd deemed her ruined. Unworthy.

When Gwen needed him most, he'd vanished.

Yesterday, Evelyn had assured Gwen that fate bound her to Benjamin.

Today, that same fate had abandoned her in hell.

"Evelyn, don't collapse now." Diana's sugary voice cut through the haze as she steadied Evelyn with faux concern. "She's alive. That's what matters. It's just... a dark ###Chapter. If Benjamin truly loves her, he'll look past it."

Diana's eyes darted around pointedly. "Speaking of... where is he?"

Evelyn's lips trembled.

Everyone here knew.

Benjamin's rejection was written in his absence.

And Diana's performance?

Transparent.

Vile.

Exactly as intended.
###Chapter 428

The silence in the hallway only emboldened Diana further.

She narrowed her eyes at Andrew. "Uncle Andrew, where's Benjamin?"

Andrew lifted his gaze, his lips trembling as if struggling to form words.

Daniel's voice cut through the tension like ice. "Diana, that's enough."

Diana feigned innocence, though her tone dripped with false concern. "I'm just worried. After what happened to Gwen, it's strange Benjamin isn't here."

Evelyn slumped back in her chair, her mind replaying last night—the laughter, the drinks, the carefree moments before everything shattered.

None of this made sense.

She was the one who had crossed the Prescott family. She was the reason Vivian had jumped. She was the one who had provoked Mr. Prescott.

So why target Gwen?

Gwen hadn’t even mentioned the Prescotts during the press conference.

Did they really hate Evelyn so much that they’d hurt her best friend just to get to her?

The emergency room doors finally swung open.

Gwen lay on the gurney, her face cleaned of blood but marred by bruises and a vivid red handprint.

The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Superficial injuries only. No organ or tendon damage. However, the head trauma caused a concussion. She may experience memory loss of recent events."

Evelyn rushed to Gwen’s side, her breath hitching as she pushed back Gwen’s sleeve.

Bruises. Strangle marks.

They covered her arms, her neck, her chest—as if someone had tried to break her apart piece by piece.

A sob tore from Evelyn’s throat. "Gwen, I'm so sorry—"

If she hadn’t been rescued by Daniel last night…

If she had just stayed away from Gwen when she returned to Mariner’s Cove…

Gwen’s fingers weakly brushed Evelyn’s hair behind her ear. "Stop crying. You look terrible."

That was all it took.

Evelyn’s tears spilled over, her grip tightening around Gwen’s wrist.

The doctor gently pulled her back. "She needs rest. We’re taking her to her room now."

Just then, the elevator dinged.

Benjamin stepped out, his clothes rumpled, his expression unreadable.

Andrew’s face lit up. "Benjamin! I knew you wouldn’t abandon her!"

Gwen struggled to sit up, hope flickering in her eyes. "Benjamin… thank you for coming. I knew you’d—"

He cut her off, his voice cold. "If you're fine, then sign this."

The divorce papers landed on the bed between them.
###Chapter 429

Evelyn's breath caught when she saw the divorce papers.

Serena couldn't hold back her fury. "Benjamin, what is this? Gwen just survived something horrific. She needs you now more than ever. What kind of man does this?"

Benjamin's expression remained cold. "Isn't it obvious?"

His icy gaze swept over Serena before landing on Gwen. "I'm a traditional man. She was rescued by strangers—multiple men. Do you think I don’t know what that means?"

His jaw clenched. "Thank God I never introduced her to my parents. At least I can still hold my head up in public."

Then, his voice turned sharp. "Sign it."

Serena’s chest heaved with barely contained rage.

Her fists tightened. "Benjamin Zeller, you’re despicable."

"Me?" He scoffed, glaring at her. "Ask yourself—if Gwen hadn’t gotten involved with you, if she hadn’t helped you, none of this would’ve happened. She wouldn’t have been targeted. We were supposed to start a family next year!"

His words were venomous, each syllable like a blade slicing through Serena’s heart.

She bit her lip, silent.

There was nothing she could say. If not for her…

Gwen wouldn’t be suffering like this. The guilt was crushing.

"Is this how you justify abandoning your wife?" Daniel’s voice cut through the tension. He leaned against the wall, arms crossed, his stare frigid. "You couldn’t protect her. Fine. But now you’re kicking her when she’s down? Pathetic."

Benjamin stiffened, finally noticing the third man in the room.

He recognized him instantly.

Sebastian Kane. The man who took down Victor Holloway.

Since that day, the Kane Syndicate ruled Mariner’s Cove. Sebastian was untouchable.

Benjamin swallowed his pride and turned back to Gwen. "Are you signing or not?"

Gwen’s face was ghostly pale.

She picked up the pen with trembling fingers. "I… I’ll do it."

Serena grabbed her wrist. "Gwen, no—"

Gwen offered a weak smile. "If this is what he wants, clinging to him won’t change anything."

With a shaky breath, she signed.

The moment the ink dried, Benjamin snatched the papers away, as if afraid she’d change her mind.

"I’ll pack my things. The Donovans bought the house, so I won’t take it. But the car stays with me."

Without another word, he stormed out.

Gwen squeezed her eyes shut. Silent tears streaked down her cheeks.

Serena’s heart shattered.

What could she possibly say to ease this pain?

"Wow," Sebastian drawled, shaking his head. "Where’d you dig up that trash? A landfill?"

Gwen didn’t respond. Her eyes remained closed, lost in her grief.
###Chapter 430

Evelyn clenched her teeth. She turned to Sebastian. "She's devastated enough. Stop with the sarcasm."

Sebastian smirked. "Why waste tears over trash? What does she care about a few sharp words?"

Evelyn frowned.

She appreciated Sebastian sending his men to save Gwen, but his tone was... unnecessarily cruel.

"Evelyn."

After a long silence, Gwen spoke without opening her eyes. "Can everyone just... leave? I need to be alone."

Evelyn hesitated. "But—"

"Please." Gwen's bitter laugh was hollow. "I'm humiliated enough. Just... give me space."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She moved to tuck the blanket around Gwen's shoulders, voice softening. "I'm sorry."

Then she turned and walked out.

Behind her, Gwen's quiet sobs resumed at the apology.

Outside the hospital room, Evelyn felt drained.

Once Gwen was confirmed safe, Daniel had left with Ethan, citing urgent business. Only Diana remained, perched on the hallway bench.

Spotting Evelyn, Diana brightened instantly. "Evelyn! Is Gwen okay?"

Evelyn gave a stiff nod.

"I saw Benjamin storming off with divorce papers." Diana guided Evelyn to sit, eyes gleaming despite her sympathetic tone. "They were perfect together. Such a shame over one little misunderstanding."

Evelyn shut her eyes. "Not in the mood. Save the act—I know you're reveling in this. Just stay away from me."

Diana laughed. "Why so tense? Gwen's the divorcée, not you. Honestly, you should be relieved. If Daniel hadn't rescued you last night, you'd be in her place right now."

Evelyn's glare could freeze lava.

Diana only leaned closer, venom dripping. "Would've been better if it was you. Then Gwen wouldn't be ruined. You're used to sleeping with taken men anyway—what's one more scandal? Daniel should've let you rot and saved Gwen instead." She sighed dramatically. "Poor Gwen. If she'd never learned your real identity, she'd still be happily following me around, putting you in your place. But no—you had to play the long-lost friend. Look where that got her." Diana's smile turned razor-sharp. "Face it, Evelyn. You're a curse."

The taunts kept coming. Evelyn's control snapped.

She looked up, fury blazing.

Diana grinned. "What? Truth hurts? Go ahead—hit me. Oh wait..." She tapped her cheek mockingly. "Last time you did, remember what hap—"

CRACK.

Evelyn's palm connected before Diana finished.

The slap left Diana stunned.

Then fury erupted. "You dare—?!"

Diana lunged, hand flying toward Evelyn's face.

Distracted by grief, Evelyn reacted too slowly. She barely dodged—the blow still grazed her cheek.

Seeing her flinch, Diana smirked and raised her hand again—

"Enough."

A strong hand caught Diana's wrist mid-swing.
###Chapter 431

Evelyn and Diana jerked their heads up at the same time.

The man gripping Diana's wrist was none other than Daniel Blackwood, who had left just moments ago.

Spotting him, Diana immediately yanked her hand free and threw herself into his arms, tears streaming down her face. "Daniel! I was just trying to comfort Evelyn since she seemed upset... but she slapped me out of nowhere!"

She tilted her swollen cheek toward him. "Look! I only hit her back in self-defense, but she kept coming at me—"

Daniel steadied her gently, his gaze flickering to the red mark on Evelyn's face. "I understand you're distressed, but that doesn't justify violence."

Evelyn met his stare with icy silence.

He exhaled sharply. "I just returned from the police station. The kidnapper who took Gwen works for Victor Holloway. Mr. Prescott orchestrated everything—he's currently being interrogated."

Diana's body went rigid in his embrace.

She scrambled out of his arms. "Mr. Prescott... is in custody?"

Daniel nodded grimly. "He confessed everything before I left. Admitted to ordering Gwen's abduction outright."

His eyes drifted toward Gwen's hospital room. "I chose not to report his initial plot against Evelyn. First, out of respect for my father's friendship with him. Second, with Victor gone, the Prescott empire will crumble soon enough—that's punishment in itself."

A heavy sigh escaped him. "But this time he went too far. Gwen Donovan is Andrew Donovan's only child. After decades of loyal service to the Prescotts, this is how he repays Andrew? Just because Gwen defended Evelyn?"

Daniel shook his head. "Perhaps losing Vivian shattered his sanity. Maybe prison is the safest place for him now. Who knows what atrocities he'd commit next?"

Diana's jaw clenched.

Last night, after Mr. Prescott's failed attack on Evelyn, she'd secretly warned him to lay low. Even if the Prescott family fell, she'd promised to restore their power once she and Daniel reconciled.

He'd agreed.

So why would he target Gwen now? Any fool could see this wasn't the time for reckless moves—not when their enemies already knew their weaknesses.

Evelyn stared at the floor. "I still don't understand why Mr. Prescott would—"

"Because he wanted her dead."

Sebastian Kane's cold voice cut through the hallway. Leaning against Gwen's doorframe, the crime lord gave Evelyn a measured look. "I know Victor's men. If they wanted revenge, they'd make their victim suffer endlessly. But this? They aimed to kill. If my people hadn't intervened, Gwen would be in a morgue right now."
###Chapter 432

The man gave a casual shrug before stepping closer. "So Evelyn knows something about the Prescott family, doesn't she?"

His words instantly drained the color from both Serena and Diana's faces.

Diana had suspicions but wasn't entirely certain...

Meanwhile, Serena's mind raced back to the 'love letter' Evelyn had given her the previous night.

She vaguely recalled Victor taking the letter, photographing it, sending it to someone, then burning it.

She never learned its contents.

But her gut screamed one truth—if the Prescotts wanted Gwen dead to keep her silent, that letter held the key.

With this realization, she sprang up like a woman possessed and burst into Gwen's hospital room. "Gwen!"

She grabbed her friend's hands urgently. "Remember that letter I gave you? What was written inside?"

Gwen blinked in confusion. "What letter?"

Serena froze.

She bit her lip hard. "We went drinking last night. You got wasted, I took you home. Then you handed me a letter, told me not to open it until I returned to Willowbrook... What secrets did it contain?"

If the Prescotts attacked Gwen to silence her, exposing their secret publicly was Gwen's only protection.

That's why Serena deliberately left the door open—questioning Gwen in front of Daniel, Diana, and Sebastian.

But Gwen's memory loss shocked her.

"Did I... drink with you yesterday?" Gwen asked, utterly bewildered.

Serena pressed on. "Then is there anything—anything at all—you want to tell me about... the Prescott family?"

Gwen laughed incredulously. "The Prescotts rule Mariner's Cove. Why would someone like me know their secrets?"

She eyed Serena like she'd lost her mind. "Are you okay? You're talking nonsense."

Serena frowned, ready to push further when Andrew sighed beside her. "Ms. Carter, the doctors said Gwen suffered severe head trauma. She's lost recent memories..."

The older man shook his head. "She doesn't recall anything you're asking about. Please stop."

Serena's hope shattered.

She studied Gwen's face—a storm of unspoken words raging in her chest, yet none could escape.

"Evelyn, leave. I need quiet."

Gwen's dismissive glance cut deep. "And stop loitering in the hallway. I heard every word out there. It's distracting."

Serena went pale.

Silence swallowed the room.

After a tense moment, Serena inhaled sharply, turned on her heel, and marched out.

Daniel and Diana still stood in the corridor.

She approached Daniel and gave a respectful bow. "Mr. Blackwood. I'd like to request leave to stay in Mariner's Cove longer. Would that be possible?"

Daniel's icy gaze gave nothing away. "What if I refuse?"
###Chapter 433

Evelyn pressed her lips together, lifting her gaze defiantly to meet Daniel’s. "Why?"

After what had happened to Gwen, returning to Willowbrook would be impossible. How could she focus on work when her best friend was suffering?

Daniel’s expression remained unreadable. "Even if you stay in Mariner’s Cove, what good will it do? Wallow in guilt? Keep reopening Gwen’s wounds so you can both drown in misery?"

His words struck like a physical blow, forcing Evelyn back a step.

She stared at him, stunned, her mouth opening and closing without sound.

Daniel exhaled sharply, his tone icy. "First, you can’t undo what happened. The best thing for Gwen now is distance—from this place, from the people involved, from the memories. You know this happened because of you. Even if she doesn’t blame you, can you honestly say seeing you won’t trigger her trauma?"

A dull ache spread through Evelyn’s chest, heavy and suffocating.

Daniel hated the pallor of her face, the pain in her eyes.

But he pressed on. "Second, she doesn’t remember why Walter targeted her. Forcing her to recall would be cruel. Even if she did, could you protect her every second? Forgetting is her best defense." He paused. "And third."

He drew a slow breath. "Sebastian Kane owes me. If I ask him to watch over Gwen and her father here, he will."

His gaze dropped to Evelyn, her face drained of color. "Staying won’t help her heal. It’ll only deepen your guilt. That’s why you’re coming back to Willowbrook with me."

He sounded distant, as if speaking from another world.

Logically, she knew he was right.

But his words were clinical. Brutal.

A reminder of her failure. Her weakness. The harm she’d brought to those she loved.

Emotion surged, thick and choking.

She opened her mouth—then coughed violently, blood staining her lips before darkness swallowed her vision.

The moment she collapsed, Daniel tore free from Diana’s grip and lunged forward, catching her just before she hit the ground.

Diana’s lips thinned. "Put her down. I’ll call for a doctor."

"No need." Daniel cradled Evelyn against his chest. "She’s just exhausted. We’re going back to the hotel."

Diana frowned. "We’re not leaving today?"

His grip tightened slightly. "Tomorrow."

If she was this desperate to stay… perhaps one more day wouldn’t hurt.

He carried her toward the elevators, Diana trailing behind with a huff. "Honestly, fainting over a few harsh words? Pathetic."

The doors slid open. Daniel stepped inside, ignoring her.

Diana followed, still muttering. "You weren’t even that cruel. Why is she so fragile?"

Daniel’s jaw clenched.

The Evelyn Carter from six years ago would never mock someone for breaking.

But this Diana…

He’d grown accustomed to her spite. He didn’t like it.

Yet he tolerated it.

Because this woman had once given up everything for him. Borne his children. Endured pain he could never fathom.
###Chapter 434

Even if she became everything he despised, he couldn't walk away.
That was his duty—as both husband and father.

But confusion gnawed at him. "I remember you and Gwen were inseparable in high school. When this happened to her, I expected you to react like Evelyn."

Diana froze.

A beat later, she turned toward the elevator buttons. "We weren't friends. Just classmates who sat together. And we never spoke after graduation. To me, Gwen is just a name from the past."

Daniel's eyes narrowed. "Yet she defended you against Evelyn."

"Because she knew I married into power," Diana said flatly. "When she realized I didn't care about rekindling old ties, she switched sides. One day she's calling Evelyn a homewrecker, the next they're willing to die for each other. Pathetic. No wonder she—"

"Diana."

Daniel's sharp tone cut her off.

He frowned, ready to argue, but the elevator doors slid open.

Diana rushed out, spotting Ethan waiting by the car.

"Help Daniel!"

Ethan hesitated, then moved toward him. "Sir, let me—"

Daniel brushed past without a word, striding to the vehicle.

Ethan's hands hung awkwardly in the air. Diana shot him a silent eye roll.

But she didn't get in.

Crossing her arms, she glanced at Evelyn's unconscious form in the backseat. "Since we're staying in Mariner's Cove tonight, you go ahead. I have people to see."

Daniel's lips curled coldly. "Who? The ghosts of your past?"

A direct jab at her earlier words.

Diana's face paled.

"I still have family here."

Her gaze turned icy. "Care to join me?"

His mocking smirk was his only reply before the car door slammed shut.

The vehicle disappeared down the road.

Diana didn't move until it vanished from sight. Only then did she exhale and hail a cab. "Police station."

At the precinct, she found Mr. Prescott waiting.

"Careless," she hissed. "You acted too soon! We hadn't even left Willowbrook before Sebastian Kane's call dragged us back. Do you realize—"

"Gwen Donovan knows you're my daughter."

Diana stiffened.

"So what? Half the Prescott family knows."

"She wrote a letter. Planned to tell Evelyn."

The old man's eyes darkened. "With Victor Holloway gone, you're our only leverage as Daniel Blackwood's wife. If your identity leaks, we lose everything."
###Chapter 435

Evelyn remained unconscious in the Starlight Grand Hotel until mid-afternoon.

The ringing phone jolted her awake at 3 p.m.

Liam's excited voice carried through the line. "Mommy, when are you coming home? Sophia and I miss you so much!"

Her son's words melted the tension in her chest.

She gripped the phone, silent for a beat before whispering, "I... can't come back today, sweetheart. I'm still in Mariner's Cove."

A pause. Then his tone shifted, steady and serious. "What's wrong?"

"A friend of mine got hurt."

Liam processed this with surprising maturity.

"I'll explain it to Sophia," he said softly. "She won't be upset. Just tell us when you're coming back, and we'll be waiting. If you need anything—anything at all—we're here for you."

Tears welled in her eyes.

Since Gwen's accident, guilt had gnawed at her. Everyone blamed her—even Daniel had said it outright.

But her children? They only cared about her.

The dam broke. Sobs wracked her body as she muffled them against her palm.

Liam waited in quiet understanding.

When her tears finally slowed, he murmured, "Mommy. Drink some water."

Sniffling, she obeyed, the cool liquid steadying her frayed nerves.

She wiped her face with a shaky laugh. "Sorry you had to see me like this."

"You've seen me take baths," he deadpanned. "We're past embarrassment."

The laugh that escaped her was wet but genuine.

After a steadying breath, she added, "Don't tell Oliver or Sophia about this. I might be home tomorrow."

Another pause. "But your friend... you're not going to help them?"

Evelyn's smile turned bitter. "Daniel won't let me stay. And he's right—my being here only makes things worse for Gwen."

Silence. Then Liam's quiet question: "So... what happened to her was because of you?"

"Yes." She squeezed her eyes shut. "I have to go now. Take care of your sister."

A sudden thought struck her. "Wait—Oliver and Nathan's plan. Did they stop it?"

"Yeah." Liam hesitated. "Oliver said he lost your signal last night, so he hacked into Mariner's Cove's surveillance to find you. He saw something that changed his mind about Daniel. Convinced Uncle Nathan to call off the attack on Blackwood Group."

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

Oliver had hacked the cameras.

Had he seen everything?
###Chapter 436

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the necklace. She couldn't let her thoughts spiral further. "Oliver," she whispered, "did your brother mention anything else?"

"Nothing."

Liam's small voice carried concern through the line. "Mommy, is something wrong?"

"Everything's fine." She forced a lightness into her tone before hastily ending the call.

The moment the phone clicked shut, Evelyn's composure shattered. It took three steadying breaths before she dared activate the communication device Oliver had gifted her.

"Mommy." His voice came through crisp and serious. "I've forwarded all evidence of the Prescott family's crimes to Mariner's Cove authorities. Aunt Gwen's attackers won't escape justice."

Her hands shook violently.

"Oliver—"

"I know everything." A weighted pause. "This necklace has remote activation capabilities. When your signal dropped last night, I accessed Mariner's Cove's surveillance grid."

Each word struck like a physical blow. "Audio recording remained active from Daniel's rescue until your call with Liam just now. Every conversation. Every detail."

Dark spots danced across Evelyn's vision.

"Don't tell the twins," she managed.

"Understood." Across the ocean, Oliver exhaled sharply. "This isn't your fault, Mommy. No one could've predicted the Prescotts' cruelty. Reconnecting with Aunt Gwen wasn't a mistake."

A mechanical hum filled the silence before he continued, "Daniel was right. You should return to Willowbrook. Within days, every Prescott crime will surface. Vincent Prescott will face consequences."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. Exposing their criminal empire was indeed the cleanest solution—no messy murder charges to sensationalize Gwen's tragedy.

But doubt crept in. "Oliver... are you certain you can handle this?"

Even diminished, the Prescotts remained formidable. Her brilliant son was still just one child against an entrenched dynasty.

"I'm not working alone." Amusement colored his tone. "Daniel Blackwood's resources far exceed mine. While I track digital trails, his network—allied with the Kane Syndicate—is gathering physical evidence from every Prescott enemy."

Evelyn froze.

Daniel's icy expression during her collapse flashed before her. Why would he dismantle his father's lifelong allies? Gwen meant nothing to him.

"Not for Gwen." Oliver anticipated her unspoken question. "Mommy... consider that he might be doing this for you."
###Chapter 437

Evelyn remained silent for a beat before letting out a bitter laugh.

"Oliver, why would Daniel do any of this for me? To someone like him, I'm insignificant. Barely worth noticing."

On the phone, Oliver stayed quiet for several seconds.

He wanted to tell her...

Through the security footage he'd hacked into last night, he'd seen the raw panic and anguish on Daniel Blackwood's face as he carried Evelyn's unconscious form.

He'd spent the entire afternoon staring at those images on his screen.

By evening, he'd contacted Nathan Pierce. Together they'd decided to halt their attacks on Blackwood Enterprises.

The screenshots didn't lie. In every frame, Daniel's distress and remorse were too visceral to be faked.

There was no way he could have known his estranged son was watching from the shadows.

He didn't even know Oliver existed.

Those frantic eyes, that desperate sprint from the abandoned warehouse with Evelyn in his arms - all genuine.

Sometimes Oliver wondered... what exactly went through Daniel Blackwood's mind?

Six years ago, he'd destroyed Evelyn's life, forcing her into this shadow existence.

Yet now, he treated Diana Hart - Evelyn's imposter - like precious treasure, enabling her every cruel whim.

And with Evelyn herself? Though he maintained a cold professional facade, his actions betrayed deeper feelings.

Oliver took a steadying breath. "Mom... if Daniel has feelings for the real you, would you ever consider—"

A sharp knock at Evelyn's door cut him off.

Frowning, she murmured a quick goodbye and ended the call.

After composing herself, she opened the door to find a weary Daniel blocking the doorway.

His broad frame filled the entrance completely. Evelyn instinctively stepped back.

"You've been awake awhile." His gaze swept over her clinically. "Am I not welcome?"

With a tight-lipped expression, she moved aside.

Daniel strode in and settled onto the sofa with effortless grace. "Feeling better?" His tone gave nothing away.

Evelyn shut the door with deliberate calm. "Mr. Blackwood, have you come to finish what you started? Another fainting spell perhaps?"

"Pathetic constitution," he scoffed, tossing a document onto the coffee table.

Evelyn picked up the acquisition agreement with narrowed eyes. Daniel was offering 30% above market value for Donovan Enterprises?

Her gaze snapped up. "Explain this."

"Andrew Donovan's sole heir is in no condition to inherit. He's lost interest in maintaining the business." Daniel poured himself tea with practiced elegance. "This acquisition provides liquidity during his family crisis while preserving his life's work from undervaluation."

He took a measured sip. "I've placed Gwen under Sebastian Kane's protection. Neither the Prescotts nor anyone else in Mariner's Cove will touch her again."

"Consider this Kane's redemption arc. Men like him make the most reliable guardians. You needn't worry."

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip.
###Chapter 438

Evelyn's fingers trembled around the papers. "Why... why help Gwen and the Donovans?"

It made no sense. Daniel had zero connections to them.

Paying 30% above market value for Donovan Enterprises? That wasn't just bad business—it was financial suicide for Blackwood Holdings.

The Donovans weren't some hidden gem. If they were, Andrew Donovan wouldn't have spent decades groveling at Mr. Prescott's feet.

Daniel's gaze remained icy. "Would you leave Mariner's Cove with me otherwise?"

Her heart clenched painfully at his words.

Sebastian's warning echoed in her mind.

Was all this... for her?

No. Impossible.

She bit down hard on her lip. That couldn't be right.

As if reading her thoughts, he set his cup down with deliberate calm. "If that explanation doesn't satisfy you, here's another."

The porcelain clinked against the glass table. "I need an established local company with deep connections as my foothold in Mariner's Cove. The Prescotts would've been ideal, but everyone knows we destroyed them. I'm not in the business of rehabilitating damaged goods."

His dark eyes pinned her in place. "My goal is to own this entire city."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, disbelief coloring her relief.

Of course.

Daniel Blackwood didn't do anything for others. Only for himself.

If he wanted Mariner's Cove's business sector, exposing Mr. Prescott's crimes made perfect sense. With the family patriarch imprisoned, Prescott Group would never recover—clearing the path for his expansion.

She met his gaze with newfound clarity. "Now I understand why they say all businessmen are sharks."

A humorless smile curved his lips. "I'll take that as praise." He stood abruptly. "So stop imagining noble motives. Everything I do serves my interests."

At the door, he paused. "Sebastian's transferring Gwen tonight—somewhere untraceable. If you want to see her, go now. We leave for Willowbrook at dawn."

The door slammed like a gunshot.

Evelyn stared at the empty space long after he'd gone.

Finally, she touched her necklace. "Oliver? You heard?"

Even when deactivated, the device allowed remote access. And that clever boy would never wait passively.

His voice came through thick with disappointment. "Every word."

Her laugh held no joy. "So you understand now? Whatever Sophia believes... there's nothing between us. There never will be."
###Chapter 439

The call with Oliver ended, but Evelyn lingered in her room, gathering her resolve before finally heading to Grandview Medical Center.

Daniel had been right.

Sebastian Kane had Gwen Donovan under tight security. Even when Evelyn requested to see her, the guards at the door had to relay the message up the chain before Sebastian himself granted permission.

When Evelyn entered the hospital room, Gwen was carefully getting out of bed with her father Andrew's assistance.

Gwen's eyes flickered with surprise at Evelyn's arrival before softening into a faint smile. "Perfect timing."

She settled into the wheelchair with a quiet sigh. "Sebastian says I'm being transferred to another facility tomorrow. I need to go home first—gather some things before the move."

Her gaze steadied on Evelyn. "Since you're here, come with me. I don’t want my father fussing over me like I'm still a child."

Evelyn pressed her lips together but stepped forward, taking the wheelchair handles from Andrew. "Alright."

She pushed Gwen out of the room, down the elevator, and into the hospital's lower level.

A sleek black Cayenne waited outside.

Sebastian leaned against the hood, a cigarette between his fingers. When he spotted them, he crushed it underfoot and strode over. Without a word, he lifted Gwen effortlessly into the backseat, then folded the wheelchair with practiced ease.

Evelyn watched, amused despite herself. "Never thought I'd see the great Sebastian Kane playing chauffeur."

He shut the car door and leveled her with an icy stare. "Life's full of surprises. I've done worse before running a syndicate."

Then he slid into the driver's seat without another word.

Evelyn blinked. He was personally escorting them?

As the car pulled away, she studied the back of Sebastian's head. Daniel wasn't exaggerating—this man would protect Gwen at all costs.

The ride was silent.

When they reached Gwen's home, the villa stood quiet.

Evelyn assumed Gwen just needed clothes and essentials. But then—

Gwen carefully tucked a wedding album into her suitcase, fingers lingering on the cover. The sight twisted Evelyn's heart.

After all these years, Gwen still loved Benjamin.

Just like Evelyn still loved Daniel, despite everything.

She inhaled sharply and caught Gwen's wrist. "This pain won't last forever."

Gwen closed her eyes and nodded, silent.

Later, as Evelyn wheeled her toward the exit, a car pulled up to the villa.

Benjamin's car.

The door opened, and he stepped out—followed by a stunning young woman.

Evelyn froze.

Gwen went deathly pale.

The woman looped her arm through Benjamin's, pouting. "Why are we here so late?"

He kissed her cheek. "Just grabbing a few valuables before she comes back."

Then they turned—and saw Evelyn.

And Gwen in the wheelchair.

Benjamin stiffened. Gwen looked like she'd been struck.

The woman arched a brow. "Darling, who are they?"

Benjamin's jaw tightened. "My ex-wife. And her friend."

The woman's gaze slid to Gwen, lips curling. "Oh. This is the one who got passed around by multiple men? Honestly, I expected someone prettier. Guess they'll take anyone these days."
###Chapter 440

Evelyn's fingers dug into the wheelchair handles.

Gwen lifted her chin, her gaze locked onto Benjamin as if she hadn't heard the woman beside him. Her voice was ice. "Who is she?"

Benjamin's jaw tightened, but he remained silent.

Gwen's voice sharpened, the frost in her tone unrelenting. "Benjamin Zeller, who is she?!"

"I'm his girlfriend," the woman—Daphne—chirped, pressing herself against him. "But don't get the wrong idea. He didn't cheat. We only made it official today. It's all because you—"

Gwen shut her eyes. "Benjamin Zeller, are you mute?"

Finally, Benjamin scowled, irritation lacing his words. "Does it matter who says it? Daphne is my girlfriend. We decided this afternoon. The divorce was finalized this morning. You have no right to question my life now."

Gwen laughed, cold and brittle, but tears streaked down her face.

Evelyn's hands curled into fists.

Benjamin exhaled sharply, pulling Daphne behind him as he strode toward the villa. When he passed Gwen, her hand shot out, gripping his wrist.

He yanked free without hesitation. "Gwen Donovan, we're divorced. You're beneath me now."

Then he walked away, leaving her hand suspended in empty air.

"Benjamin Zeller!"

The shout came from Evelyn as he passed her. She sucked in a sharp breath before her fist connected with his face.

She put every ounce of fury into that punch.

Benjamin staggered back, blood dripping from his nose.

"Nice hit," Sebastian drawled from the sidelines. He reached out, casually pulling Gwen's wheelchair aside before crossing his arms, watching with detached amusement.

Gwen shot him a glare. "Aren't you going to help?"

Sebastian smirked. "Who should I help? Your ex-husband or your friend?"

Gwen froze, speechless.

Meanwhile, Benjamin wiped the blood from his nose, his glare venomous. "Have you lost your mind?"

"You're the one who's lost his mind!" Evelyn spat. The rage and grief she'd bottled up all day exploded. She didn't know where the strength to make him bleed came from—but he deserved it.

Her fists clenched again. "Gwen loved you for years! You were just some nobody from a backwater town, and she was the heiress of Donovan Enterprises. She fought for you, married you—and now, when she needs you most, you do this? Are you even a man?!"

Another punch landed, this time on his jaw.

Benjamin stumbled back. Daphne squeaked and scurried away.

Wiping blood from his lip, Benjamin sneered. "Evelyn, you really want to do this?"

He was still a man—stronger, heavier. Even dazed, he could overpower her.

His hand swung toward her face, fast.

Evelyn braced herself, arms raised—

But a hand caught Benjamin's wrist mid-air. A deep, familiar voice cut through the tension.

"Hitting a woman? Pathetic."
###Chapter 441

The moment Evelyn heard that deep voice, her body tensed. She'd been bracing for impact, but now she froze.

Daniel?

Lowering her protective arms, she turned toward the sound.

There he stood—tall, imposing, gripping Benjamin's wrist with effortless strength. Benjamin's face twisted with rage, veins bulging as he struggled to break free, but Daniel held him firmly, unmoved.

Evelyn blinked, stunned.

"Evelyn! Get over here!" Gwen's urgent voice snapped her back to reality. She quickly retreated, stepping beside her friend.

Gwen grabbed her hand, rubbing it gently. "When did Daniel get here?" she whispered, confused.

Sebastian, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed, answered before Evelyn could. "He's been tailing us since we left Grandview Medical Center." His gaze flicked to Evelyn. "Guess he was worried something might happen to her."

He smirked, stretching lazily. "If I didn't know he was married, I'd think he was pursuing her. Last night, when we went in to get her, he didn’t even negotiate terms—just agreed to everything I asked. And this man’s supposed to be a ruthless businessman."

Sebastian chuckled. "Enemies could exploit that kind of weakness. When a man stops thinking rationally over a woman, he’s already lost."

His eyes lingered on Evelyn. She was attractive, sure, but not enough to bring a man like Daniel to his knees. Was she?

Evelyn’s face paled at his words.

Gwen shot Sebastian a glare. "Pursuing her? Don’t be ridiculous. That would never happen—not even if the world was ending."

Evelyn echoed softly, "No, he'd never have feelings for me. Not even then."

She knew better than anyone. She had spent years by his side, caring for him, loving him—yet he never once looked at her that way. In the end, he discarded her without hesitation.

First it was Serena. Now it was Diana.

He was a man who fell in and out of love too easily. His kindness to Diana now? Just gratitude for giving him children.

But when he grew tired of her…

He’d cast her aside, just like he had done to Evelyn.

Even in a different body, she still couldn’t reach his heart.

"Mr. Blackwood," Benjamin spat, finally wrenching his wrist free. "This is between me, Evelyn, and Gwen. It has nothing to do with you!"

He snatched the tissue Daphne handed him, wiping blood from his face before glaring at Gwen. "If you didn’t want a divorce, you should’ve said so earlier. You signed the papers so easily this morning—I thought you had some self-respect. But now you show up here, stopping me, letting your friend hit me?"

Gwen’s frown deepened. "I didn’t know you’d be here." She took a shaky breath and turned to Evelyn. "Hand me my suitcase."

Evelyn nodded, dragging it over. Gwen unzipped it with trembling hands.

Inside, alongside the wedding album, were stacks of photos—memories of her and Benjamin. One by one, Gwen pulled them out and threw them to the ground.

"All day, I told myself you were just traditional. That your pride couldn’t accept a wife like me. I thought… even if we divorced, I’d still cherish what we had." Her voice cracked. "But I was wrong. I was the only one holding onto these memories."

Tears slipped free as she closed her eyes.
###Chapter 442

"You divorced me this morning, found a new girlfriend by afternoon, and now you're bringing her to our home at night. Benjamin Zeller. I wasted years of my life loving someone like you."

Evelyn inhaled sharply before turning to Sebastian who was flicking open his lighter. "Mind if I borrow that?"

With a casual shrug, Sebastian approached. He tore out Gwen's most stunning solo portrait from the stack before setting the remaining photos ablaze.

He offered the salvaged photo to Gwen. "A keepsake."

"Burn it," Gwen whispered, shaking her head.

Some memories weren't worth preserving.

A faint smirk played on Sebastian's lips as he pocketed the photo, his gaze lingering on Gwen with newfound curiosity.

The flames consumed the photographs hungrily.

"Would've burned them myself," Benjamin sneered through the crackling fire.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, refusing to engage.

When only ashes remained, she grasped Gwen's hand. "Let's go."

With Sebastian's assistance, they helped Gwen into the wheelchair. Benjamin turned to leave but found his path blocked by Daniel and his two imposing bodyguards.

"What now, Mr. Blackwood?" Benjamin spat.

Daniel's voice dripped with ice. "Tyler, Dominic."

The bodyguards snapped to attention. "Sir!"

"Did you witness him attempting to strike Evelyn earlier?"

"Clear as day, sir."

"Handle him." Daniel strode toward his waiting car without another glance.

Evelyn's breath caught as she recognized the vehicle—the same one that had trailed them from Grandview Medical Center to the hotel, then back to the hospital. She'd dismissed it as coincidence.

He'd been following her this entire time.

After settling Gwen back at the hospital, Evelyn emerged past midnight, exhaustion weighing her bones. The day's events felt surreal—too brutal to be real.

She'd always envied Gwen's picture-perfect marriage to her longtime crush. Now their fates mirrored each other's in the cruelest way.

"She stable?" Daniel's voice startled her.

The black car still idled curbside. He sat passenger-side, window down, watching her with unreadable eyes.

"Cried herself to sleep, but she'll survive." Evelyn's stomach growled audibly.

Daniel gestured toward the car. "Dinner."

The nearby diner's private booth offered sanctuary. Evelyn eyed Daniel's sling-bound arm. "Need help eating?"

"Practiced left-handed." He demonstrated with a spoon before studying her. "Still believe in marriage after today?"

Evelyn barked a laugh. "Lost that faith years ago."

"You've never been married."

"My divorce finalized last year." She stabbed her fork into the salad. "Ex-husband was human garbage."
###Chapter 443

Daniel's grip on his utensils tightened momentarily before he let out a soft chuckle. "So because you're divorced and your ex was a monster, you decided to steal Liam and Emily and raise them as your own?"

Evelyn lifted her glass and took a sharp gulp of water before meeting his gaze. "You could put it that way."

Daniel raised his own glass, swirling the liquid absently. "Why didn't you have kids with him?"

"He didn't deserve them." She set her glass down with a quiet clink and picked up her fork again. "He cheated when I needed him most. Even tried to kill me for his mistress. Tell me, does a man like that deserve children?"

If she hadn’t already been pregnant back then, she wouldn’t have wanted his children at all.

He never deserved them.

Even now, she believed those three children were hers alone.

They had nothing to do with Daniel.

Her eyes locked onto his as she spoke, sharp and unflinching.

Something in her stare unsettled him—as if he were the one who had betrayed her.

He frowned and turned away. "So you just let him walk free?"

A cold smirk curled her lips. "Oh, I’m not done with him. But he’s too powerful. I’m biding my time."

Daniel gave a slow nod. "If you ever need help, you know where to find me."

Evelyn let out a mocking laugh. "Sure."

Silence settled between them as they finished their meal.

When they returned to the hotel, Evelyn spotted Diana waiting at the entrance. The dim glow of the streetlights cast long shadows around her slender frame, making her look fragile and lost.

As they approached, Evelyn noticed her red-rimmed eyes—she had been crying.

The car rolled to a stop.

Daniel stepped out first.

Diana immediately rushed into his arms, her voice trembling. "Daniel, you're back! I had a nightmare..."

He chuckled, brushing a hand over her hair. "Even if you had a nightmare, you didn’t have to wait outside in your pajamas."

With a gentle pinch to her nose, he guided her inside, arm draped around her shoulders.

Just before the doors slid shut, he glanced back.

The car hadn’t moved.

Evelyn was still inside.

"Aren’t you coming?"

From the driver’s seat, Ethan sighed. "They’re probably already in their room by now."

Evelyn blinked, as if snapping out of a daze. "Got a cigarette?"

Ethan shot her a disapproving look. "You smoke?"

"No." She exhaled sharply. "But right now, I could use one."

The next morning, Ethan’s urgent voice jolted her awake.

Because of the incident with Gwen, yesterday’s meetings in Willowbrook had been postponed.

They needed to return early today—there was still too much left unresolved.

Sitting in the passenger seat on the drive back, Evelyn stared at the fading cityscape. This had been her home for twenty years.

She didn’t know when she’d see it again.

"Breaking news: Dennis Prescott of the Prescott Group has been accused by multiple companies of illegal business practices. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment."
###Chapter 444

The car radio droned on about the Prescott family scandal. "Following the corruption charges against Dennis Prescott, his only daughter Vivian Prescott took her own life by leaping from a skyscraper. The Prescott empire now stands leaderless, teetering on the brink of collapse..."

Evelyn shut her eyes tight. She wondered if Gwen had heard the news. At least it might bring her friend some small measure of peace.

Fishing out her phone, she meant to check for messages from Gwen. Instead, Benjamin's latest social media post glared back at her.

'Filing assault charges at the precinct. Donovan family, consider this your warning - I'm coming for compensation!'

Accompanying photos showed his bruised arm and swollen face - unmistakable souvenirs from his altercation with Tyler and Dominic.

Evelyn's thumb hovered before double-tapping both images. Justice served.

"Ethan, turn that off." Diana's weak voice floated from the backseat. "I need to rest."

Daniel's concern followed. "You're pale as a ghost. Are you ill?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes at their sickening display, turning toward the passing scenery.

The radio silenced instantly. In the rearview mirror, Diana clenched her jaw while Daniel cradled her. Every muscle in her body vibrated with barely contained rage.

This was all Evelyn's fault!

Her plan had been flawless. After the surgeries transformed her into Evelyn's doppelgänger, she'd return to Willowbrook and reclaim Daniel's heart.

But that scheming bitch had beaten her to it - arriving with two brats in tow, stealing what rightfully belonged to Diana.

Now? Daniel treated her with polite indifference. No fiery passion, no desperate longing. Just... obligation.

This trip to Mariner's Cove should have been her triumph. Instead, she'd lost her body double, watched Victor Holloway fall, and now her father faced prison. The Prescott dynasty crumbled around her.

Teeth grinding, Diana's hatred burned brighter.

Evelyn Carter would pay.

The Prescott name would rise again - once she eliminated that gold-digging whore and her bastard children. Daniel would be hers. The empire would be restored.

The morning's journey bled into afternoon before Willowbrook's skyline appeared.

Evelyn woke to Gwen's message - transferred to Grandview Medical Center, complete with photos of blooming cherry trees in the courtyard. After replying, she stretched lazily. "Drop me at Lakeside Residences, Ethan."

Liam and Sophia had texted earlier, waiting for her there.

"Evelyn." Diana's saccharine voice dripped poison. "The children are still with you, yes? Have them meet us downstairs. We'll take them home afterward." Her sickly sweet smile didn't reach her eyes. "A mother misses her children, you understand. Daniel must be desperate to see them too."

She patted Daniel's arm for emphasis. "Don't you agree, darling? Our family should be reunited."
###Chapter 445

The tension inside the car was palpable. Evelyn's muscles tensed instantly.

It had been days since she last saw Liam and Emily. Six years of never being apart from them, and now this unbearable separation.

Her heart ached with longing.

Their phone calls yesterday afternoon and this morning only confirmed how much they missed her too.

The joyful anticipation of reuniting with her children was brutally crushed by Diana's icy words, leaving only a hollow chill in its place.

This was deliberate. Diana didn't care about the children. This was purely about manipulation - targeting Evelyn through them.

"Daniel?" Diana's soft voice broke the silence when he didn't respond immediately.

He blinked, clearing his throat before meeting Evelyn's gaze in the rearview mirror. "We'll follow Diana's suggestion."

Blood ties mattered. Despite Diana's six-year absence, she remained their biological mother. This rare initiative to bond shouldn't be refused.

Evelyn's nails dug crescent moons into her palms. She bit her lip hard, clinging to one desperate hope. "What about... just the afternoon with them?"

She needed to hold them. To cook their favorite meals. To breathe in their laughter. A mother's simplest wish.

But Diana was determined to steal even this.

"I miss my babies terribly," Diana cooed, emphasizing the endearment as she leaned against Daniel. "Surely you miss them too, darling?"

Daniel's breath hitched. Of course he did. Before leaving for Mariner's Cove, he'd stationed Isabelle at Lakeside Residences precisely to receive daily photos.

His phone gallery overflowed with those precious images. If mere pictures could evoke such longing, how much more their actual presence?

He rubbed his temples. "Compromise. Diana and I as birth parents, Evelyn as their guardian - we all love them. After this separation, we're equally desperate. Evelyn can bring them down later and accompany us to Silvercrest Manor."

Both women froze.

"No."

"That's unacceptable."

Their simultaneous objections plunged the car into silence again.

Diana glanced at her phone screen and forced a laugh. "Daniel's right. We're family. No need for petty arguments, yes?"

Evelyn's teeth ground into her lower lip. Every fiber of her being screamed refusal. But legally? She was just the nanny here.

A shuddering breath escaped her as she surrendered. "Fine."

"How generous of you," Diana purred, snuggling against Daniel while reading a text from Silvercrest Manor staff: "Gregory Blackwood and Eleanor Blackwood have arrived."

When the car reached Lakeside Residences, Evelyn stepped out with leaden steps.

"Mommy's home!"
###Chapter 446

"Mommy! I've missed you so much!" Sophia cried out.

Evelyn fumbled with her keys, barely managing to unlock the apartment door before two small whirlwinds came barreling toward her.

Liam and Sophia latched onto her legs, their excited chatter filling the hallway.

"Mommy, I knew you'd come back now, but Liam swore you wouldn't be here until later!"

"Mommy, while you were gone, I had Isabelle teach me how to make coffee! I brewed your favorite Arabica blend!"

"Mommy, I've planned everything—you can't leave this afternoon. You have to stay home, read to me, and build Legos with Liam!"

"Mommy..."

Evelyn looked down at the two dark-haired children clinging to her, the words she needed to say lodged painfully in her throat.

Behind her, Isabelle stood in the living room, smiling softly. "Ms. Carter, they skipped school today just to wait for you. They've been decorating since morning like it's Christmas."

Only then did Evelyn notice the colorful banners strung across the walls, the childish scrawl spelling out their longing.

In the center of the wall, flowers had been painstakingly arranged into a message: Welcome home, Mommy!

The sight twisted Evelyn's heart—warmth and agony warring inside her.

She swallowed back the sting of tears and knelt. "Liam, Sophia. Daniel is waiting downstairs."

Liam's expression darkened instantly. Sophia tilted her head, confused. "Why is Daddy down there?"

"He's waiting for us." Evelyn gently smoothed the little girl's hair. "He misses you both. And... Diana is with him. She wants to see you too. So let's go down and go back to Silvercrest Manor, okay?"

Sophia's face fell. She shook her head violently. "No, no, no! Diana is scary! I don't like her! I don't want to go!"

Evelyn closed her eyes, her chest aching. How she wished they could stay. If only she could take Liam and Sophia far away, reunite with Oliver, and never look back.

But...

She bit her lip and squeezed Sophia's hand. "Please, sweetheart. Be good."

Tears welled in Sophia's eyes, but she didn't argue further.

Liam sighed. "If Mommy had a choice, she wouldn't agree to this. Let's just go. Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Hart won't hurt us."

He took his sister's hand. "Isabelle, grab my jacket and backpack."

Isabelle hesitated, then hurried to gather their things.

"Mommy, don't forget—you owe us a whole day," Liam said as he shrugged on his jacket. "You have to make it up to us."

Evelyn nodded. "I promise."

Ten minutes later, they descended the stairs, Isabelle trailing behind with their luggage.

"Liam, my darling!" Diana threw her arms open the moment she saw them, rushing forward to embrace him. "Mommy missed you so much!"

Liam leaned close to her ear, his voice low. "Ms. Hart, aren't you tired of pretending?"

Diana's smile didn't waver. "If we're talking about acting, your mother is the real expert, don't you think?"

Liam scoffed and pulled away, marching to the car with all the dignity his small frame could muster. He climbed in, settling into the leather seat before slanting a look at Daniel. "Mr. Blackwood. It's been a while."

Daniel smirked at the boy's attitude. "Indeed, it has."

"I seem to recall," Liam mused, eyeing him, "that before you left, you were planning to divorce Ms. Hart." His gaze sharpened. "So tell me—what changed after your little trip to Mariner's Cove?"
###Chapter 447

Daniel arched an eyebrow.

He hadn't anticipated this would be the first thing his son asked after days apart.

A sidelong glance at Liam. "You don’t seem thrilled about Evelyn and me reconciling?"

Liam hesitated. He turned, meeting Daniel’s gaze with unsettling seriousness, then held up two fingers.

"First, I never accepted Diana Hart. To me, she was never Mom. Evelyn is.

Second, do my feelings even matter to you, Mr. Blackwood? If they did, you wouldn’t drag me and Emily back to Silvercrest Manor against our will.

Lastly, I don’t care about you and Diana. I just want to know why your attitude flipped 180 degrees after Mariner’s Cove."

Before the trip, they were separated, even discussing divorce papers. Yet after returning, they were suddenly inseparable—closer than ever.

Daniel’s eyes narrowed slightly. What changed?

That night after the banquet. He’d been drunk. It was the first time he’d been intimate with Diana since their reunion. The way she whispered "darling"—so familiar, so much like Evelyn—had stirred something in him. The memories were hazy, but the feeling lingered.

She had sacrificed everything for him once. Six years of longing couldn’t be erased, even if she wasn’t the same woman anymore.

Waking up beside her the next morning, he realized he couldn’t discard her. Not when he’d been the one to break her.

But explaining this to a child? Impossible.

He exhaled, forcing a light chuckle. "Love changes minds. That’s why I decided not to divorce her."

Children believed love kept parents together, didn’t they?

Liam scoffed. "Your love is fickle."

Daniel’s jaw tightened. "I’ve loved your mother for years."

What did this kid know?

Rolling his eyes, Liam waved at Emily, who stood hesitating between cars. "Get in."

Emily blinked, then toddled over. The moment she climbed in, Liam locked the doors. "Just us three in here."

He leaned back, shutting his eyes. "Wake me when we arrive."

Emily nodded solemnly. "Sleep well, Liam."

Then she turned to the window, ignoring her father entirely.

Daniel frowned. Emily used to adore him. Now?

A quiet cough. "Emily."

She didn’t turn. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

His voice softened. "Are you angry with me?"

"I’d never dare." Her sweet voice turned icy. "You won’t even let Mom see us alone. You’re too controlling to argue with."

Silence.

This had been Diana’s idea—bringing them home to bond. He’d hoped it would bridge the gap.

Instead, it only widened it.
###Chapter 448

Daniel missed them terribly. It had been ages since he last saw them. That's why he proposed bringing everyone to Silvercrest Manor for a reunion.

But it seemed...

He had only managed to upset both the kids and Evelyn?

The convoy continued moving.

Soon, the line of cars halted in front of Silvercrest Manor.

By the time Evelyn stepped out of the car where Dominic and Tyler were unloading the luggage, Diana had already exited as well.

Standing beside Daniel’s car, Diana plastered on a fake smile. "Emily, come here! Mommy will carry you inside!"

Emily rolled her eyes, walked right past her, and toddled toward the entrance on her own.

Liam, however, bounded into Diana’s arms with a grin. "If Emily doesn’t want you to carry her, then carry me! I’m not too heavy—just a little more than Emily."

Diana strained to lift him, her expression souring with effort as she took an unsteady step forward.

Liam casually looped his arms around her neck. "Ms. Diana, be careful! If you drop me and I get hurt, that would be very bad."

Diana’s face darkened further.

Nearby, Evelyn bit back a laugh. Truthfully, Liam wasn’t that heavy. Back when they lived abroad, she could carry both him and Emily at the same time without issue.

But for someone unused to holding children, even Liam’s weight was exhausting.

Some things only came naturally to mothers.

Daniel couldn’t stand watching Diana struggle.

"I’ll take him." He strode forward, effortlessly scooping Liam into his arms. Diana seized the chance to slip her arm through Daniel’s, then shot Evelyn a smug glance. "Ms. Evelyn, don’t just stand there. Come inside."

With that, she walked toward the entrance with Daniel, Liam nestled comfortably between them. The trio looked disturbingly like a perfect little family.

"Mommy." A small hand suddenly slipped into Evelyn’s. Emily, who had already reached the door, had doubled back, worried. "Liam was trying to punish her. But Daddy just had to interfere."

Emily squeezed her mother’s fingers.

"Let’s go in."

Evelyn exhaled, forcing a faint smile as she let Emily lead her inside.

"Liam! Emily!" The moment they entered, Gregory and Eleanor Blackwood’s excited voices filled the foyer.

"We heard you were coming home today, but we thought it wouldn’t be until tonight!" Eleanor pulled both children close, beaming. "We missed you so much!"

Liam forced a smile. "Hello, Great-Granny."

Following her brother’s lead, Emily reluctantly echoed, "Great-Granny, you look even younger than before!"

The old woman’s laughter rang out, delighted.

Daniel removed his coat and settled onto the sofa, watching the scene with unexpected warmth flooding his chest.

Years ago, when they first married, Evelyn had said she wanted children while Eleanor was still alive—so she could experience the joy of four generations under one roof.

Back then, her kindness had moved him. Despite the Blackwoods’ initial hostility toward her, she had treated them like her own family.

His gaze flicked to Diana, and he gestured for her to join him. "Come here."

Surprised by the rare affection, Diana hurried over.

He draped an arm around her shoulders and sighed. "Do you remember what you once said?"

Diana stiffened slightly. "O-of course I remember."

Afraid he’d press further, she quickly turned to Evelyn, who stood frozen near the doorway. "Ms. Evelyn, have a seat."

Evelyn stared at the scene before her—the family she had lost—and a sharp pang of loneliness struck her chest.

Diana’s voice snapped her back to reality. But when she looked up, it wasn’t Diana or Daniel she saw—it was Gregory storming toward her, face twisted in fury.

"How dare you show your face in this house again!"
###Chapter 449

The sharp crack of flesh hitting flesh shattered the tense silence.

Evelyn's head snapped sideways from the force. The metallic tang of blood flooded her mouth, crimson droplets tracing down her chin.

"Mommy!" "Mommy!"

The twins sprang from the couch like startled birds, rushing to shield their mother. Liam positioned himself defensively in front of Evelyn while Emily grabbed tissues with surprising composure.

Daniel's jaw tightened at the sight. Beside him, Diana feigned concern. "Victor, take your sister away." Her gaze flickered to the composed boy. "This is between your grandfather and Aunt Evelyn. Grown-up matters."

Victor's icy glare could freeze hell before turning back to tend to Evelyn with Emily.

Diana played the peacemaker. "Gregory, you're frightening the children."

The patriarch's nostrils flared. "She knows exactly why she deserved that."

Evelyn dabbed at her split lip with trembling fingers. "How original. A powerful man resorting to violence against a woman. Truly inspiring behavior."

Gregory's face purpled with rage. "Do you know Dennis Prescott? The man I've called friend for thirty years?" His finger jabbed toward her. "That honorable man wouldn't harm a woman unless provoked beyond reason!"

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Tell me how you murdered Vivian."

Evelyn's bitter laugh echoed through the grand hall. "So the great Gregory Blackwood believes I killed his precious goddaughter? That's why Dennis came after me?"

"You think this is funny?" Spittle flew from Gregory's lips. "You took his only child!"

Evelyn leaned back on the couch, the twins flanking her like miniature bodyguards. Emily bared her teeth like a feral kitten while Victor mirrored his mother's defiant posture, arms crossed.

The sight made Gregory's blood boil. These children carried Blackwood blood, yet they defended this woman like she was their queen? That they looked at him with such undisguised hostility?

He whirled on Daniel. "Control your offspring! They're Blackwoods, not her personal guard dogs!"

Daniel sipped his tea with infuriating calm. "I lack that privilege. Six years of absence tends to damage parental authority." His cold gaze met his father's. "Much like our own relationship."

The delicate china clinked against the table. "As you said - they are Blackwoods." The unspoken challenge hung in the air: Which means they're mine to raise, not yours to command.
###Chapter 450

"Then you should understand, Evelyn raised them for six years. My advice? Treat Evelyn with respect, unless you want the children to disown you as their grandfather."

Gregory's face turned an alarming shade of purple.

Across from him, Evelyn observed his reaction with an icy detachment, the ghost of a smirk playing on her lips. "Mr. Blackwood, you accused me of killing Vivian. Where’s your proof? Accusations like that require evidence, don’t they?" She crossed one leg over the other, her voice sharp as frost. "Vivian jumped to her death. Did I hold a knife to her throat? Push her off that building? If memory serves, I was at Grandview Medical Center with a friend visiting her ex-husband when it happened. The security footage proves it. My alibi is airtight."

Gregory scoffed. "Don’t play innocent! You drove her out of Mariner’s Cove! That girl was raised in luxury, never knowing hardship—until you came along. You tore her from her father, forced her to abandon the only home she’d ever known. Of course she couldn’t take it!"

Evelyn’s laugh was razor-thin. "Unreasonable. That’s the word for people like you, isn’t it, Mr. Blackwood?"

She inhaled deeply, her gaze unflinching. "Let me remind you why she was exiled. At the welcome banquet, Vivian sabotaged me—gave me an invitation, then scrubbed my name from the guest list. During factory inspections, she assigned me two vile men who harassed me relentlessly, even laying hands on me. And in that shop? A 'freak accident'—a chunk of mineral hurled straight at me. If Daniel hadn’t stepped in, I’d be in a hospital bed right now. But that wasn’t even the worst of it."

Her voice dropped to a lethal calm. "That night, Mrs. Blackwood and Vivian got me drunk. While I was unconscious, they sent seven male escorts into my hotel room. Then Vivian blackmailed my friend, forcing her to publicly brand me as the woman who destroyed Daniel’s marriage."

Evelyn’s eyes locked onto Gregory’s. "Tell me, if Vivian had done this to someone in your family—if she weren’t your precious Prescott heiress—would you still defend her? If I’d pressed charges, she’d be in prison, not six feet under."

A glacial pause. "Daniel asked me to compromise out of respect for your friendship with the Prescotts. But Vivian chose to end her life. Is that my fault?"

Gregory’s fists clenched. "Lies! Vivian would never—"

His teeth ground together. "She was sweet, obedient! The only time she ever lost her temper was over Daniel, and even then, she’d moved on. You’re twisting the truth!"

He whirled toward Daniel—then froze. Beside him, Diana’s eyes shimmered with furious tears.

Those eyes…

They were identical to Vivian’s.
###Chapter 451

Gregory Blackwood couldn't trust his own vision.

He vividly recalled visiting the Prescott family in Mariner's Cove years ago. Drunk and sentimental, he'd pitied Vivian Prescott.

In his mind, Vivian had always been the perfect match for Daniel. As a father, he believed even if he'd never shown Daniel affection, his son should honor family traditions and marry his childhood betrothed.

But Daniel had shocked everyone by refusing the arranged marriage outright. He'd married Evelyn Carter instead - another Mariner's Cove native - purely to defy his family.

Even after Evelyn's disappearance, Daniel remained stubbornly opposed to Vivian. He'd rather become engaged to Serena Hart, Evelyn's sister, than entertain any possibility with Vivian.

That drunken night, Gregory had berated Daniel while comforting Vivian, insisting she deserved better. Vivian had wept at his words.

Her gaze that evening haunted Gregory. The way Diana Hart now looked at him with those same eyes... as if they were identical...

Noticing Gregory's stare, Diana paused. She met his gaze with apparent gratitude before quickly looking down.

Gregory stood frozen for several heartbeats before shaking himself.

This was absurd. Vivian was dead. And when alive, she'd despised Evelyn above all others - the woman who'd stolen Daniel from her.

Diana Hart was simply Evelyn Carter under a new name.

Drawing a sharp breath, Gregory turned back to Daniel. "Speak, Daniel!"

Daniel's lips curled into an icy smile. "You want the truth?"

His gaze turned distant. "If there's one woman I despise most in this world, it's Vivian Prescott."

Beside him, Diana's body went rigid. Her joints locked as if paralyzed. She stared at Daniel's sharp profile, her own voice sounding foreign. "Wh...why?"

She'd loved Daniel for years. She knew her feelings weren't reciprocated. But hate? Her nails dug into her palms. She needed to understand.

Daniel frowned slightly. He'd expected this question from Gregory, not Diana. But the answer remained unchanged. "Because she'd do anything to get what she wants."

His tone was casual. "True, our families arranged our marriage before birth. But I rejected this political union since childhood. The elders' friendship shouldn't dictate my life. The Prescotts had agreed to cancel the engagement - even Eleanor approved. Just when I thought it was over, I met Vivian in Mariner's Cove by chance. Suddenly, the engagement was revived. Despite my refusal, both families pressured me to marry her."

He gave a bitter laugh. "She schemed relentlessly to secure this marriage. Father, is this the obedient girl you praised?"

Gregory's expression darkened.

Daniel wasn't wrong. Vivian had indeed employed underhanded tactics. "She only wanted happiness. Her actions hurt no one."
Daniel chuckled darkly. "She schemed her way into marrying me back then. Who's to say she wouldn't use other tricks against Evelyn now?"

His left hand moved with practiced ease, undoing his shirt buttons one by one. The bandages wrapping his right arm made Eleanor gasp. "Daniel! What on earth happened to you?"

"Vivian's doing." His icy gaze flicked to Gregory. "Every accusation Evelyn made is backed by evidence I've gathered. I intended to let a dead woman's secrets rest... but if you insist she was innocent and Evelyn framed her..." A cruel smile twisted his lips. "I'll happily expose a corpse's sins to the world."

Gregory's face turned ashen. He staggered back, knees buckling. "No... Vivian was a good girl..."

"Gregory!" Diana rushed forward, steadying him with surprising familiarity. She shot Daniel a venomous look. "She's dead, Daniel! Must you shatter your father's memories? Is this how you treat family?"

Her teeth sank into her bottom lip. "She loved you! So she played some games to win you - what woman wouldn't? However wrong her methods, you shouldn't despise someone for loving you!"

Daniel's brow arched. "Funny you'd say that, Diana." His voice dripped with mock curiosity. "Given how chummy you are with Vivian now... Have you forgotten what she did to you right after my wedding?"

Diana went deathly pale.

That night six years ago...

She'd deliberately aimed her car at Evelyn.

It happened outside the Starlight Grand Hotel. Vivian had seized the chaos of rush hour traffic to swerve toward Evelyn waiting at the curb. Only Evelyn's quick reflexes saved her.

The incident was buried - partly because the traffic cameras showed genuine confusion, partly because no actual harm was done. But Daniel had banished Diana from Willowbrook with a warning.

Back then, she'd acted out of jealous rage. How could Evelyn Carter steal everything she desired?

She never imagined fate would twist so cruelly - that Evelyn would vanish, that she'd one day wear the face of the woman she hated to win Daniel's affection.

Diana's lips trembled. "Of course I remember. But that night was chaotic. Vivian only swerved to avoid another car." She hurriedly changed tactics, supporting Gregory's shaking form. "Ancient history shouldn't matter now."

She practically dragged Gregory upstairs, her voice sickeningly sweet. "Come, let's get you settled. What matters is your truth - if Vivian was good to you, then she was good!"

Eleanor frowned as they disappeared. "Since when is your wife so... familiar with your father? They barely knew each other."

Daniel's eyes darkened. "Exactly."

Before today, they'd only met once - at his wedding. Yet Diana treated Gregory with unsettling intimacy, just as she'd inexplicably bonded with Vivian while shunning her old friend Gwen.

What happened during those six missing years? The question burned in his mind like acid.
###Chapter 453

"Are you hurt?"

After Evelyn helped Gregory upstairs, Daniel turned to Serena, his gaze darkening at the sight of the angry red mark swelling across her cheek.

"It's nothing serious."

Serena pressed the ice pack Liam handed her against her face, her voice cool. "I'll live."

Her eyes flickered toward Daniel, sharp and unreadable. "Your parents went through so much trouble to get me here with the kids. Was this the real plan? To let your father take his anger out on me?"

Daniel's jaw tightened. "I didn't know he'd be here."

Beside him, Eleanor scoffed. "Of course you knew!"

The old woman crossed her arms, her lips pursed. "I had the butler inform you before you arrived! Why does it matter what some employee thinks? Even if you did bring her here for that, so what? After everything she's done, one slap is nothing!"

Silence fell over the room.

Daniel's expression turned glacial as he summoned the butler.

"Madam Eleanor did instruct me to tell you," the butler admitted, hesitating. "But I didn’t want to interrupt your business discussions, so I informed Mrs. Hart instead."

His gaze shifted uncertainly toward Daniel. "Did she… not mention it?"

Another heavy silence.

Daniel exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. "Dismissed."

Now it made sense.

From the start, Diana had been insistent on bringing the children back to the estate. Then, at Lakeside Residences, she'd suddenly changed her mind—urging Serena to come along.

Of course.

Any servant in the Blackwood household knew about Gregory’s friendship with Dennis Prescott.

Diana had orchestrated this.

She’d deliberately lured Serena here, knowing Gregory would be present.

All for this moment.

Daniel’s lips thinned.

No wonder Diana had been so attentive to his father lately.

He sighed, weariness settling between his brows. "Liam."

His gaze shifted to the boy sitting protectively beside Serena. "Take your mother upstairs to your room."

Liam frowned, confused.

"You wanted to talk to her, didn’t you?" Daniel’s voice was low. "Unless you’d rather do it here, where everyone can hear?"

Understanding dawned on Liam’s face.

This was their chance—time alone with Serena.

The boy shot up from the couch, grabbing Serena’s hand and pulling his sister along. "Come on!"

Serena chuckled at his eagerness, then glanced back at Daniel.

He gave her a barely perceptible nod.

Go.

With a slow breath, she tightened her grip on the children’s hands and followed them upstairs.

The sound of the bedroom door closing echoed through the quiet house.

Now, only Daniel and Eleanor remained in the living room.

The old woman glared. "Why did you let them go with her? So what if she misses them? I miss them too!"

Daniel’s gaze was steady. "You lived just fine before you knew they existed."

His eyes flicked toward the first floor.

"To us, they’re unexpected blessings. To her?" His voice softened. "They’re the family she built over six years. The ones she can’t live without."

He didn’t know why Serena had taken them.

Maybe, as she’d said, she’d given up on love and decided to raise them as her own.

But if he and Diana could forgive her past mistakes, then they should also respect the bond she’d forged with the children.

The love that had grown between them, day by day.
###Chapter 454

Eleanor Blackwood rolled her eyes dramatically.
"Anyone would think Evelyn was the children's real mother with how she acts."

Daniel Blackwood's lips twisted into a wry smile. "Grandmother, you shouldn't say things like that."
Six years ago, Evelyn Carter had been the only woman in his life. Where would he have met Diana Hart back then?

The elderly woman pursed her thin lips. "Was I wrong? You prioritize Evelyn over your own father. Diana, on the other hand—they weren't close before, but now she behaves like his favorite daughter!"
She shot him a pointed glare. "Go check on your father upstairs!"

Daniel drained his teacup in one smooth motion before setting it down with deliberate grace. His polished shoes clicked against the marble stairs as he ascended.

On the first-floor landing, Diana was just closing the guest bedroom door behind her.
Seeing him approach, she offered a practiced smile. "Gregory's asleep now. Don't worry, I've calmed him down—he won't be angry with you anymore."

Daniel's eyes narrowed to slits. "We need to talk."
Without waiting for a response, he turned sharply toward the study. Diana followed, her heels tapping a nervous rhythm.

"You knew my father and grandmother were visiting." Daniel's voice cut through the silence as soon as the door closed. "That's why you deliberately invited Evelyn today, isn't it?"

His knuckles whitened against the mahogany desk. "You're well aware of how my father feels about Dennis Prescott. Seeing Evelyn would trigger him—yet you orchestrated this exact scenario." A muscle ticked in his jaw. "I thought our trip to Mariner's Cove would make you stop these games. That you'd finally understand there's no rivalry between you and Evelyn. Clearly, I overestimated you."

Diana's nails bit crescent moons into her palms. After a calculated pause, she bit her lower lip and lifted tear-brightened eyes.

"Daniel, I don't understand these accusations." Her voice trembled with manufactured hurt. "I only thought Gregory and Eleanor missed the children, and Evelyn hasn't seen them in weeks..."

Her arms snaked around his waist from behind, pressing her cheek against his back. "This is my fault—I didn't consider Gregory's history with Evelyn. I'll apologize immediately." A choked sob escaped her. "Please don't think I'm some scheming villain."

Daniel's body turned to stone beneath her touch. After a long moment, his shoulders relaxed slightly. "You... you're usually so meticulous. How could you overlook this?"

A triumphant smirk flashed across Diana's face before she nuzzled against him, her voice dripping with faux remorse. "Meticulous? If I were, I'd have noticed all of Vivian's manipulations sooner. Maybe then I could've stopped her from..." She let the sentence hang, injecting just enough guilt to make him flinch.

Daniel exhaled sharply, turning to pull her into an embrace. "I misjudged you."

Of course she'd be distraught after her best friend's suicide. Anyone would be.

"Daniel..." Diana seized the moment, tilting her face up with calculated vulnerability. "We're finally home." Her fingers traced idle patterns on his chest. "I... I want to stay with you tonight." A blush crept up her neck. "You wouldn't turn me away, would you?"
###Chapter 455

Evelyn had no clue how Diana managed to persuade Gregory, but by dinner at Silvercrest Manor that evening, his demeanor had shifted entirely.

The explosive rage from earlier was gone. Instead, he even offered her an apology.

"Ms. Evelyn, I acted rashly. Diana explained everything to me, and I realize now—Vivian was the one at fault."

The older man stared at the faint red mark still visible on her cheek from his slap and exhaled heavily. "I owe you an apology. I'm sorry."

Evelyn was stunned. Despite her lingering resentment toward him—despite him being her elder—she forced a small smile and let the matter drop.

Perhaps because Daniel and Diana had been absent for so long, and with the entire family gathered, the butler had instructed the chef to prepare an extravagant feast.

Gregory was in high spirits, insisting Daniel drink with him, glass after glass. By the end, only Daniel, his father, and Diana—hovering attentively beside him—remained at the table.

Past 10 p.m., Gregory finally decided to leave, thoroughly intoxicated. Daniel, on the other hand, was barely conscious.

"He's still my son, after all—his alcohol tolerance is nowhere near mine!" Gregory laughed boisterously as his bodyguards helped him stagger toward the door. He shot Diana a knowing glance. "Take him upstairs. I did what you asked."

Diana smiled sweetly. "Thank you, Gregory."

The moment he was gone, her lips curled in satisfaction. Her scheme had worked. She hauled Daniel up the stairs, her heart pounding.

In their bedroom, she laid him on the bed and immediately began unbuttoning his shirt. She wouldn’t waste this golden opportunity.

But the second she undid the second button, his large hand clamped around her wrist.

His eyes were shut, his mind clouded by alcohol—yet his instincts were razor-sharp.

"Who are you?" His voice was rough, slurred, but firm. "You're not Evelyn Carter. You're not my wife. Get... out."

He shoved her away.

Caught off guard, she stumbled and crashed onto the carpet, pain shooting through her limbs. She gritted her teeth, fury boiling in her chest.

Unbelievable.

Even sober, he refused her. And now, drunk out of his mind, he still rejected her?

She sucked in a sharp breath, forced herself up, and climbed onto the bed again, tearing at his collar. Just as she leaned in to kiss him—

His hands snapped up, gripping her wrists with startling precision, and flung her aside.

"Get out!"

His eyes remained closed, his voice thick but unmistakably clear. "You're not Evelyn Carter. You're not my wife. Stay away from me..."

Diana scrambled to her feet, glaring at the flushed, drunken man sprawled across the bed.

This had happened before—back at that banquet in Mariner's Cove.

Even drunk, he could push her away effortlessly. All those TV dramas where characters mindlessly slept together while wasted? Lies.

Daniel, even in this state, clung to some shred of awareness. His senses were sharper now, more honest. He could tell instantly—she wasn’t Evelyn.

She stood there, teeth grinding so hard she feared they might crack.

Was she really going to let Evelyn reap the rewards of her efforts again?
###Chapter 456

Evelyn closed her eyes, considering her choices carefully.

Daniel never drank to excess—this was a rare occurrence. A golden opportunity she couldn't afford to waste.

That night at the party, Daniel had slept with Diana, but by morning, he remembered nothing. He believed it had been Evelyn instead, which was why he'd halted the divorce proceedings and even started treating her better than before.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn made her decision. She would summon Diana and deliver her straight into his arms.

Even if Daniel later discovered the truth, he'd never admit it. Guilt would make him treat Evelyn even more kindly. This was her chance to drive them apart for good.

With a quiet exhale, she picked up Daniel’s phone and composed a disappearing message—a feature exclusive to his device. The text would vanish after being read, leaving no trace. He often used it for confidential business dealings.

Perfect.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was tidying up Liam and Emily’s room in Silvercrest Manor. The space was unusually cluttered—Emily’s design sketches and Liam’s toys scattered everywhere.

She gathered the sketches, pausing to examine Emily’s work. The girl had clearly inherited Evelyn’s passion for jewelry design. Though her drawings were still childlike, they held flashes of creativity that impressed her.

After setting the sketches aside, she added a few finishing touches to one of the designs. Just then, her phone buzzed.

A message from Daniel.

[Come to the study.]

Evelyn frowned. It was past 10:30 PM. What could he possibly want at this hour?

[It’s late. We can talk tomorrow.]

The reply came instantly.

[No. This can’t wait. Come now.]

She hesitated but ultimately obeyed. He was still her boss, after all.

Slipping on a jacket over her nightgown, she stepped out of the children’s room—only to nearly collide with Diana, who had just emerged from the study.

Their eyes locked.

Diana smirked before turning sharply and disappearing into the master bedroom, slamming the door behind her.

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. What now?

She assumed Daniel and Diana had fought again, and he’d summoned her to discuss work. The thought irritated her—she had no interest in being dragged into their marital drama.

With a sigh, she knocked lightly on the study door.

No answer.

She knocked again. Still nothing.

Finally, she pushed the door open. "Mr. Blackwood, you—"

Before she could finish, strong arms wrapped around her from behind, pulling her inside. The door slammed shut.

The sharp scent of alcohol filled the air. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.

"Are you drunk?" she whispered.

"Evelyn Carter," Daniel murmured, his lips brushing her ear. "I missed you so much..."
###Chapter 457

Evelyn Carter had stayed up all night in the study with Daniel Blackwood. He finally succumbed to sleep around 4am.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on Evelyn's shoulders. The uncomfortable stiffness in her muscles made her wince as she rose from the chair. But the thought of the children waking up to find her missing sent a jolt of urgency through her. She crept out of the study, careful not to make a sound, and slipped back into the children's room.

As she eased the master bedroom door shut behind her, Diana Hart's sharp eyes caught the movement. A bitter taste of envy coated Diana's tongue as she watched Evelyn disappear down the hall.

Seizing the opportunity, Diana entered the study. The scent of alcohol clung to Daniel as she hauled his limp form back to their bed. With practiced precision, she painted fake love bites across her skin using makeup, stripped down, and nestled herself against Daniel's chest.

Morning light spilled across the sheets when Daniel stirred awake. The first thing he saw was Diana's sleeping face—her bare skin marked with what appeared to be fresh bruises. His stomach twisted.

What the hell happened last night?

"Morning, darling." Diana's lashes fluttered open, feigning shyness when she noticed his gaze. She pulled the sheets higher, covering herself. "See something you like?"

Daniel turned his face away, jaw tight. "You should rest. We were up late."

His memory was hazy, but he remembered being awake until the early hours. Evelyn had always been the one who struggled to keep up with his stamina. After nights together, she'd sleep well past noon just to recover.

Yet here Diana was, bright-eyed and energetic.

Diana giggled, stretching like a satisfied cat. "Oh, I'm fine. A little sore, maybe, but nothing a hot shower won't fix."

She slid out of bed, pulling on a silk robe. "I'll make breakfast for everyone."

Daniel arched a brow. "Since when do you cook?"

"Since always," she purred, flashing him a smirk before gliding out the door.

The real reason for her sudden domesticity? She knew Evelyn would be too drained to lift a spoon, let alone cook. This was her chance to play the perfect wife.

Daniel watched her leave, suspicion gnawing at him.

Evelyn's stamina was never this strong. Something isn't right.

At 8am, Evelyn was still deep in sleep when a sharp knock rattled the children's door.

Liam Carter scowled at the intrusion, then hopped off the bed and yanked the door open.

Diana stood there, apron tied neatly around her waist, hair pinned back like some 1950s housewife.

"Liam!" she cooed. "Where's Emily and Aunt Evelyn? I made breakfast. Come eat before it gets cold."

Liam's eyes narrowed. "Since when do you know how to cook?"

Diana's smile didn't waver. "I've had hidden talents. Try it and see."

Liam glanced back at Emily, who was sketching at her desk. "Fine. Let's go, Em." He moved to slam the door, but Diana wedged her foot in the gap.

Her eyes darted past him, landing on Evelyn's sleeping form. "Why not wake Aunt Evelyn too? She must be exhausted."

The sugary sweetness in her voice made Liam's skin crawl.
###Chapter 458

"Eight o'clock already. She should be up by now for breakfast."

Daniel frowned at Diana's words and immediately blocked her path with his arms. "No. Mom's still sleeping. We can't disturb her."

Of course, Diana ignored him completely. She stood by the door and shouted at the top of her lungs, "Evelyn! Evelyn! It's eight! Time to wake up! I made breakfast! You're supposed to leave with Daniel by nine for your meeting!"

"Evelyn!"

Her voice was sharp enough to jolt Evelyn awake. She blinked at the clock—only three hours of sleep.

Still, Diana was right. Work couldn't wait. She dragged herself up, rubbing her eyes. "Thanks. Be down soon."

A smug smile curled Diana's lips. "Breakfast's ready. Better eat while it's hot. Come down now?"

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded. "Thanks." She yawned and shuffled toward the bathroom.

"Hurry up! Everyone's waiting!" Diana called before disappearing downstairs.

Liam planted himself by the bathroom door, arms crossed. "Why so tired? You went to bed when we did."

Emily studied Evelyn's dark circles with concern. "Mom, you should rest. Liam and I can go down first."

Evelyn managed a tired smile. "It's fine. I have work today." Another yawn escaped as she turned on the faucet.

When they finally descended, the dining room was full. Not just Daniel and Diana—Gregory and Eleanor Blackwood were there too.

Eleanor's sharp gaze landed on Evelyn's exhausted face. "Tsk! A guest making everyone wait? You're just an employee at Blackwood Group. Acting like you own the place?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened, but she stayed silent. Too tired to argue, she dropped into a chair without responding.

Diana had outdone herself—every dish was Daniel's favorite.

"Impressive cooking," Gregory remarked between bites. He shot Diana an approving look. "Such dedication. Waking early to cook all this?"

Diana beamed. "It's nothing. Just doing my part as Daniel's wife." She threw Daniel a meaningful glance. "Right, darling?"

Daniel chuckled. "Take the compliment."

He was genuinely touched. After being up most of the night, she'd still cooked this feast.

A first in their marriage.

Liam scowled at their display. "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Evelyn needs the day off. She barely slept."

Daniel's brow furrowed as he turned to Evelyn.

Dark circles. Pale skin. She looked wrecked.

Annoyance flickered in his eyes. "Evelyn, you know today's important. First day back after your trip. What kept you up?"

His gaze hardened. "What were you doing last night?"
###Chapter 459

What had she been doing all night?

Evelyn pressed her lips together, shooting Daniel a sharp glare. "What exactly do you imagine I was up to, Mr. Blackwood?"

He had been drunk last night, yet he still managed to text her, summoning her to his room. And now he was pretending ignorance?

Daniel's gaze turned icy. "How should I know?"

After dinner, he had reminded her to rest early—they had a crucial meeting today to finalize the business trip reports.

So why had she ignored him?

She had slept in the children's room with Liam and Sophia. They went to bed early, leaving her no space to work. There was no reason for her to stay awake.

Unless...

Had she spent the night talking to Theodore?

His expression darkened at the thought.

Last night, he'd overheard Liam asking about Theodore. Evelyn had ruffled his hair and said, "Why don't you ask him yourself? We'll call him once we're back in your room."

Had that call lasted all night?

Daniel scoffed. "I always considered you efficient and professional, Ms. Carter. Yet you chose to stay up knowing we had an important meeting today." His eyes raked over her tired face with disdain. "Seems I misjudged you."

Evelyn massaged her temples. Her head pounded, and the smell of breakfast made her stomach churn.

She dropped her fork with a sigh. "Don't worry. I won't take leave today. I know my responsibilities." Her glare intensified. "But let me make one thing clear—you have no right to scold me for losing sleep."

Standing abruptly, she forced a polite smile toward Eleanor. "Thank you for breakfast, Mrs. Blackwood. Unfortunately, I'm not hungry. I'll head to work now."

Without another glance at Daniel, she strode upstairs, returning moments later with her files before marching out the door.

As she left, she caught sight of Daniel leaning close to Diana, serving her food with an intimacy that felt like a knife to her chest.

"Evelyn, you should eat something." Ethan frowned at her pale face, insisting on driving her. "You don't look well."

She slumped into the passenger seat, eyes closed. "I'm fine."

Her phone buzzed—a long message from Liam, first berating Daniel's behavior, then urging her to eat as soon as she reached Blackwood Enterprises. He didn’t want her collapsing from hunger.

Evelyn stared at the screen, her heart clenching.

Her children were the only ones who truly cared.

As for Daniel...

She steeled herself. Last night had been nothing more than a necessary sacrifice to cure Oliver.

When they arrived at Blackwood Tower, she hurried inside without looking back.

Ethan immediately called Daniel. "Sir, Evelyn seems unwell. You should—"

"I know."

The line went dead before he could finish.
###Chapter 460

Ethan exhaled sharply through his nose.
The clock struck nine, but Evelyn had already reviewed every document for the morning briefing.

"Cassandra, assemble the team immediately," Evelyn instructed without looking up. "I need to present my Mariner's Cove findings."

Cassandra nodded, but hesitated at the doorway. Her gaze lingered on Evelyn's ashen complexion. "Director Carter... perhaps you should rest first?"

The entire department had noticed. Evelyn looked like she might collapse any second - her pallor matching the sterile white walls of her office.

A tired smile curved Evelyn's lips. "The presentation can't wait."

Cassandra's frown deepened. She'd met workaholics before, but Evelyn redefined the term.

Halfway down the corridor, Cassandra spun on her heel. "At least let me bring you coffee?"

Evelyn waved her off. "Not necessary." These days, even the aroma of coffee turned her stomach.

The door clicked shut.

Five minutes later, it burst open again. Evelyn didn't bother glancing up. "Cassandra, if you're this concerned about my health, channel that energy into preparing the—"

Silence.

Evelyn's pen stilled. She looked up to find Daniel Blackwood leaning against her doorframe, a takeout bag dangling from his fingers. His smirk was infuriatingly casual. "Should I play secretary and gather your team?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened. She returned to her paperwork. "Come to ensure I'm earning my salary, Mr. Blackwood? Rest assured, I've been productive since 7 AM."

Daniel's amusement faded as he took in her hollow cheeks and bloodshot eyes. He dropped the food on her desk with a thud. "About this morning—"

Evelyn's pen froze mid-signature. The irony burned - him pretending concern when he'd robbed her of sleep. Worse, he had the audacity to play ignorant.

Disgust coiled in her stomach. He knew exactly why she hadn't slept, yet pretended otherwise. What could she say? That his presence in her bed had left her too unsettled to rest?

She exhaled sharply, snapping her folder shut. "Anyone else could ask me that. But you?" Her laugh was brittle. "You forfeited that right."

Grabbing her files, she brushed past him without a second glance.

Daniel watched her go, irritation prickling his skin. The woman was impossibly stubborn. His gaze fell to the untouched breakfast. He'd gone out of his way to—

A crash echoed through the office.

Cassandra's scream followed instantly: "Director Carter! Someone call an ambulance!"
###Chapter 461

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open to the sterile white ceiling of a hospital room. Grace sat beside her, worry lines creasing her forehead.

"You're here?" Evelyn rasped, pressing fingers to her temple as she attempted to sit up.

Grace swiftly adjusted the pillows behind her. "Daniel and I just got back from Mariner's Cove. Tyler called saying you collapsed—I came straight here without even stopping home!" Her gaze sharpened. "I thought this was just a business trip. What happened?"

Evelyn exhaled. "It wasn't the trip."

Grace's lips thinned. "I know." She leaned closer, voice dropping. "The doctor said you barely slept last night and skipped breakfast. That's why you fainted." A beat. "Was it Daniel?"

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded.

Grace swore under her breath. "And he still made you come to work this morning?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "He was drunk. Didn't remember a thing. Blamed me for being sleep-deprived. I was so furious I—"

"—decided to punish yourself to spite him?" Grace cut in, exasperated. She clasped Evelyn's hand. "Your health comes first. Remember why you returned to Willowbrook."

Evelyn swallowed. She hadn't forgotten. The only reason she'd come back was to conceive Daniel's child—to save Oliver. Her body had to stay strong for the baby.

A shaky breath escaped her. "I won't do this again."

That morning, seeing Daniel with Diana had clouded her judgment. She'd acted recklessly.

Grace sighed, then brightened suddenly. "Oh! Remember that woman asking about Vivian Prescott at Grandview?" She pulled out her phone. "I ran into an old colleague during my trip. Turns out, Vivian had plastic surgery there two years ago!"

She thrust the screen forward. "Minor procedure, but successful. My colleague even took a photo!"

Evelyn frowned, about to mention Vivian's supposed death—then froze. Her grip tightened on the phone.

"This...is Vivian?"

Grace nodded. "Positive. My colleague remembered everything. Vivian kept talking about the Prescott family during her consultation." She peered at the image. "Funny, she kinda looks like Diana here." A pause. "Wait, no—more like how you used to look."

Evelyn's pulse spiked. The woman bore a resemblance to the Vivian she remembered from six years ago, but her features were subtly altered—an unsettling blend of Vivian and Diana.

One thing was certain: she looked nothing like the deceased Vivian Prescott in the obituaries.

Evelyn's lips pressed into a bloodless line. Her hands trembled.
###Chapter 462

Evelyn knew cosmetic surgery could transform someone beyond recognition. But the photo in her hand bore no resemblance to the Vivian Prescott she'd met days ago.

Having undergone procedures herself, Evelyn understood the extensive time and effort required to alter one's face completely. Which meant...

If this photo truly depicted Vivian, then the woman who died was a decoy.

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip as Daniel's words echoed in her mind.

"This might not be the real Vivian Prescott."

"The deceased was a stand-in. The real Vivian is still out there."

"She's nothing like the Vivian I knew. It's like they're two different people."

A cold sweat broke across Evelyn's skin.

If the dead woman wasn't Vivian, then her supposed suicide over refusing to leave Mariner's Cove was a lie. So what had killed her?

And why would the Prescotts orchestrate such an elaborate deception? Where was the real Vivian?

Evelyn sifted through her memories of Vivian.

If their encounters had been with an impostor, then Mr. Prescott's hatred for her was also fabricated.

The night Victor kidnapped her—Gwen's involvement—it all crashed back with terrifying clarity.

Fear coiled tight around her chest. Her fingers trembled as the color drained from her face.

"Evelyn? Are you okay?" Grace frowned at her sudden pallor.

Evelyn met her friend's gaze. "Hypothetically, if someone hired a double, convinced their family to play along, then had that double killed... what would their endgame be?"

Grace shrugged. "Probably assumed a new identity. Why?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She nearly confessed her suspicions but stopped herself.

Some truths were too dangerous to share.

She wouldn't drag Grace into this. Handing the phone back, she murmured, "Delete that photo. Pretend you never saw it."

Grace opened her mouth to protest when the door swung open.

Daniel loomed in the doorway, his broad frame casting a shadow across the hospital bed.

"Awake, I see." His gaze flicked to Evelyn before he strode inside, depositing a fruit basket and thermal lunchbox on the table. He turned to Grace. "Doctor's verdict?"

Grace hesitated, then smiled. "Exhaustion. No sleep, skipped breakfast, overworked—perfect storm for fainting."

Daniel's lips twitched. "Exhaustion?"

Grace huffed. "Obviously. Need I remind you why she's exhausted, Mr. Blackwood?"

Amusement glinted in his eyes. He couldn't recall Evelyn exerting herself—not in Willowbrook, nor Mariner's Cove.

But arguing seemed pointless. He sat, unsealing the lunchbox. "Feed her," he ordered, pushing it toward Grace.

Grace's brows shot up. "You should be doing that."
###Chapter 463

Daniel and Evelyn froze at the words. Evelyn frowned, about to speak, when Daniel scoffed. "Why should I feed her?"

Grace rolled her eyes. "Selective memory, Mr. Blackwood? Or do you just enjoy pretending you didn't do anything wrong? You—"

"Grace," Evelyn cut in, leaning weakly against the headboard. A tired smile touched her lips. "Didn't you say you rushed here straight from work? I'm fine now. You should go home and rest."

Grace pressed her lips together. She knew Evelyn was stopping her from bringing up Daniel's actions. With a sigh, she gave Evelyn a resigned look. "Fine. Take care of yourself."

She shot Daniel a sharp glare before turning on her heel and slamming the door behind her.

Silence settled between Daniel and Evelyn in the hospital room.

Evelyn exhaled, picking up the lunchbox Grace had left on the bedside table. She balanced it in one hand, spoon in the other, blowing lightly on the steaming soup before taking a sip.

Daniel watched, struck by how familiar her movements were—how much they reminded him of his ex-wife. Maybe gentle souls just shared certain habits.

Hungry, Evelyn finished the soup quickly. Setting the empty container aside, she leveled a cool look at Daniel. "Why are you here, Mr. Blackwood? Don’t you have a company to run? Or did you come to drag me back into that meeting?"

Daniel smirked, his gaze dark with amusement. "What if I said yes?"

"Then my answer is no." Evelyn yawned, stretching slightly. "Grace was right. My health comes first. I shouldn’t have skipped breakfast just to prove a point this morning."

Daniel’s eyes narrowed. "So you admit it was about proving me wrong?" He crossed his legs, his piercing stare locking onto her. "No matter what, I never want you risking your health like that again."

Evelyn laughed softly. "That’s not something a boss usually says to an employee."

Daniel paused. After a beat, his voice dropped lower. "Do you really think that’s all we are?"

The intensity in his tone sent a traitorous flutter through Evelyn’s chest. Even after all these years, he could still make her heart stutter.

Maybe some loves never truly faded.

But she wasn’t that naive girl anymore.

She knew exactly who Daniel Blackwood was. And she wouldn’t be fooled again.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a mocking smile. "Then what do you think we are, Mr. Blackwood?"

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, Daniel sighed. "I thought we were friends."

Evelyn almost laughed out loud. She wanted to snap, I don’t befriend men like you. But she swallowed the words and forced a polite smile instead. "How flattering. It’s an honor to be your friend."
###Chapter 464

Evelyn exhaled sharply and turned her face away from Daniel, making it clear she didn't want to discuss the matter further.

Instead, she changed the subject. "Back in Mariner's Cove, you mentioned something about Vivian Prescott. You believe the woman who died wasn't the real Vivian—that she was an imposter."

Daniel gave a slow nod. "I did say that."

He had dispatched his men to gather evidence, but the Prescotts were too powerful in Mariner's Cove. They had erased every trace.

Evelyn sighed and met his gaze. "I believe you now."

His brow furrowed. "Why bring this up suddenly?"

Before she could respond, a sharp knock interrupted them. Diana's sugary voice floated through the door. "Evelyn? I heard you fainted! I rushed here from Silvercrest Manor as soon as I got the news. I even made you soup. May I come in?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened at the sound of Diana's voice. Instinctively, she glanced at Daniel.

Daniel rose, his expression unreadable, and yanked the door open.

"D-Daniel?" Diana's eyes widened in feigned shock. "You... you came to see Evelyn too? You're the CEO of Pierce Corporation! Shouldn't you be at work?"

A scoff came from behind her. "Pathetic. Why is he wasting time on that trash?"

Evelyn recognized that voice instantly—Victoria, her birth mother.

Then came Richard's smooth, placating tone. "Daniel, my wife speaks harshly, but she means well. You're an important man. Visiting an ordinary employee like this... it's beneath you."

Evelyn leaned back against the pillows and shut her eyes.

She knew exactly why Diana had brought them.

This was a calculated move—to humiliate her in front of Daniel, to make her feel small in the presence of the people who should have loved her.

A bitter sigh escaped her lips.

Meanwhile, Daniel remained motionless in the doorway. His cold gaze swept over Victoria and Richard. "Why are you here?"

Victoria sneered. "What? Afraid we'll interrupt your little rendezvous with this gold-digger?" She shot Evelyn a venomous glare. "If we hadn't come, we wouldn't have known how much she means to you!"

She jabbed a finger at Daniel. "Don't forget what our Diana has sacrificed for you! She gave you two beautiful children! Hurt her, and you'll regret it!"

Daniel's lips curled into a humorless smile. "So you came because you knew I'd be here." His piercing stare shifted to Diana. "Bringing your parents along... This isn't just a friendly visit, is it?"
###Chapter 465

Tears shimmered in Evelyn's eyes. She pressed her lips together, throwing Diana and Richard a troubled look. "I specifically asked to come alone. Now look what happened—Daniel completely misread the situation!"

Evelyn sniffled and thrust the insulated container toward Daniel. "I made soup for Serena. Since you're convinced my parents and I have hidden agendas, we'll leave immediately."

She spun on her heel, but before she could take a step, Daniel's hand closed around her wrist. His grip was firm but not painful.

"If you truly came without ulterior motives, why leave now?" His voice softened unexpectedly. "I apologize for misjudging you."

Serena's blood ran cold.

In all her years—first as his wife, then under her new identity—she'd never heard Daniel speak to anyone with such tenderness. Not even when she'd fainted from his earlier accusations.

Yet here he was, apologizing to Diana without hesitation.

He'd apologized to both Vivian and Diana, but never to her.

"Fine, I accept your apology!" Diana's face lit up instantly. She looped her arm through Daniel's, pulling him into Serena's hospital room together.

Victoria and Richard exchanged glances before following.

Diana marched to Serena's bedside, popping open the container with theatrical flair. "Serena, darling, I made this soup specially for you. You must try it!"

Serena's brow furrowed. She opened her mouth to refuse, but Diana had already pressed the bowl into her hands.

After a brief hesitation, Serena accepted it. Diana wouldn't dare poison her in front of witnesses. Besides, Daniel's earlier soup was the only thing she'd eaten all day—her stomach still growled faintly.

"Eat it while it's hot," Diana urged, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "I worked so hard on this just for you."

"Thank you... Mrs. Blackwood." Serena lifted the spoon to her lips.

The moment the broth touched her tongue, her entire body stiffened.

This flavor...

It was Victoria's signature recipe.

The exact same soup Victoria used to make whenever Serena fell ill as a child. The taste she'd craved during her years abroad, dreaming of her mother's cooking.

A lump formed in Serena's throat. She tilted her head back, blinking rapidly to stop the tears.

When she lowered her gaze, Diana's face filled her vision—that perfect mirror of her former self. Only now, Diana's lips curled in a victorious smirk, her eyes glinting with undisguised malice.

"Delicious, isn't it?" Diana purred. "I slaved over the stove all morning."

Serena's nails dug into her palms. Diana couldn't cook to save her life—this was Victoria's work.

Her eyes darted to Victoria, who stood stiffly by the door. Their gazes locked for one electric moment.
###Chapter 466

Victoria scoffed, turning her head away with undisguised contempt. "What a disgrace to good food!"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the edge of the hospital bed, her heart twisting painfully.

Grace sighed and took Victoria's hand. "Mom, please. Evelyn is in the hospital because she overworked herself. The least we can do is show some kindness."

Then she shot Evelyn a sharp, knowing look. "Isn't that right, Evelyn?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, refusing to speak. The ache in her chest was unbearable.

Here was her birth mother, standing right in front of her—yet she was pouring affection onto an imposter while treating Evelyn like a stranger.

Diana had orchestrated this perfectly.

She had visited Victoria earlier that morning, casually mentioning how Evelyn used to love her mother's soup when she was sick. So Diana convinced Victoria to make it, then brought both parents along to the hospital.

She wanted Evelyn to suffer.

After all, Evelyn had destroyed Diana's family, sent her father to prison—she deserved to feel the same pain.

And what better way than to turn Evelyn's own parents against her?

The cruelest suffering was betrayal by those who were supposed to love you.

Diana wanted Evelyn to regret ever returning to Willowbrook. If she had stayed gone, none of this would have happened.

A smirk curled Diana's lips. "Evelyn, is there anything else you'd like to eat? I could make something for you. Mom could help me." She squeezed Victoria's hand affectionately. "Right, Mom?"

Victoria's expression softened as she looked at Diana, then hardened when she turned to Evelyn. "I'd be happy to teach her, but it's wasted on someone like you."

Richard nodded in agreement. "Grace is too generous. Everyone knows what kind of woman you are—first a maid at Silvercrest Manor, then scheming your way into Blackwood Group. Only Grace would still treat you with kindness."

Daniel's jaw tightened.

He glanced at Evelyn, who was still clutching the half-finished soup, and said, "Finish it."

Evelyn swallowed hard, lowering her head as she forced herself to drink. Tears slipped into the bowl, turning the broth salty.

No one noticed—except Daniel.

When she was done, she wiped her face with a tissue, pretending to dab away sweat.

Daniel took the bowl from her and placed it back in the container, handing it to Diana. "Thanks for coming. Evelyn appreciated the soup. But she needs rest now."

Diana frowned. "Daniel, aren’t you coming with us? It’s lunchtime—we should take my parents somewhere nice."

Daniel's gaze flickered to Evelyn, who was still discreetly wiping her eyes. "Another time. They’ll be in town for a while. I have work matters to discuss with Evelyn."

Diana's lips thinned in irritation, but after failing to persuade him, she finally left with Victoria and Richard.

The moment the door closed, Daniel strode back to Evelyn and shoved the tissue box toward her. "What’s wrong? Since when do their words affect you?"
###Chapter 467

Evelyn Carter accepted the tissue from Daniel Blackwood, dabbing at her tear-streaked cheeks. "Their opinions don't matter to me," she whispered between quiet sobs.

This wasn't the first time Victoria Sinclair and Richard Sinclair had misjudged her.

"I just..." Evelyn sniffled, tilting her chin upward to stop fresh tears. "I miss my mother terribly."

Daniel's posture went rigid. He turned sharply to face her. "You miss your mother?"

"Yes." Evelyn nodded. "Whenever I fell ill, she'd prepare chicken soup. Claimed it had healing properties - swore I'd recover faster if I drank enough. As a child, I hated the taste. She'd spend hours coaxing me to finish just one bowl." A wistful smile touched her lips. "Eventually I grew to love it, but then... I lost the chance to have it again." She exhaled heavily. "Mrs. Blackwood's soup today... it brought everything back. I apologize you had to witness that, Mr. Blackwood."

Daniel studied her face intently, his piercing gaze searching for any hint of deception.

Evelyn set the tissue box aside and met his eyes. "Let's drop this subject. You mentioned having work matters to discuss?"

His brows knitted together. She knew perfectly well he'd used work as an excuse to decline Diana's invitation. This was her way of dismissing him if no actual business existed between them.

Yet there was something pressing he needed to address. "Pierce Corporation and their hacker ceased attacks on Blackwood Enterprises since yesterday. Did you intervene?"

Evelyn hesitated. She'd nearly forgotten that situation. Daniel's question reminded her of crucial information she'd meant to share. "Would you accompany me to Lakeside Residences? There's something you should see."

The files Nathan Pierce had sent remained on her laptop, left in her apartment during yesterday's rushed hospital admission. She needed to show Daniel the evidence directly.

He eyed her pallid complexion skeptically. "Are you even cleared for discharge?"

"I'm fine." Evelyn offered a weak smile. "Two bowls of soup and an IV later, I won't be collapsing anytime soon."

When she smiled, her eyes curved into crescent moons, softening her entire expression.

Daniel found himself momentarily transfixed. Something about her smiling eyes inexplicably reminded him of Evelyn Carter - the same gentle warmth that once made him want to pull her close.

That tenderness had vanished from Diana's gaze long ago. Perhaps her personality shift had erased it.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Evelyn's voice snapped him from his thoughts. "Shall we go?"

Daniel gave a curt nod before striding to the nurses' station to arrange her discharge.

A nurse wheeled Evelyn to the hospital entrance where Ethan Reynolds waited in the driver's seat. He turned, taking in Evelyn's sickly appearance. "Shouldn't you rest longer?"

Evelyn shook her head, leaning back against the seat with closed eyes.

Daniel settled beside her. "Drive."

The engine purred to life.

Lakeside Residences' considerable distance from Grandview Medical Center allowed Evelyn some rest. By the time they arrived, exhaustion had claimed her.

"Sir?" Ethan kept his voice low. "Should we wake her?"

Daniel studied the frail woman beside him. With a sigh, he removed his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "Let her sleep."

Minutes stretched silently in the parked car.
###Chapter 468

Evelyn Carter stirred awake to find the sky already painted in twilight hues.

The familiar masculine scent of Daniel Blackwood enveloped her, accompanied by the rhythmic tapping of fingers against a keyboard.

She winced, forcing her heavy eyelids open.

Daniel's striking profile filled her vision first—sharp jawline, thick brows, and those unfairly long lashes. Even working in the dim car light, he looked like he'd stepped out of a magazine.

No wonder Diana Hart had been willing to abandon everything just to claim him.

Evelyn's gaze lingered, lost in thought, until his lips curved. "Enjoying the view?"

His deep voice jolted her. She blinked as he turned fully toward her. "Sleep well?"

"Uh—yes."

"Four hours." He checked his watch, smirking. "Impressive, Sleeping Beauty." Snapping his laptop shut, he arched a brow. "Weren’t you the one who insisted on talking?"

Right. Lakeside Residences. She’d dozed off during the drive.

Sighing, she pushed upright—only for a tailored jacket to slide off her shoulders and pool at her feet.

His jacket.

Daniel’s eyes dropped to it. Before he could comment, she snatched it up. "I’ll clean it before returning it." Then she bolted from the car.

His low chuckle followed her.

The elevator ride was torture.

Evelyn clutched the jacket like a shield, hyperaware of Daniel standing just behind her. His gaze burned into her back, making her spine stiffen.

The silence was suffocating.

Thankfully, the doors soon slid open—revealing Theodore Allen frozen mid-step, staring at her in shock.

"Evelyn? Weren’t you in Mariner’s Cove?"

Her breath caught. "When did you get back?"

Theo had stayed behind after the kidnapping incident, claiming unfinished business. That was barely forty-eight hours ago.

"This morning." He coughed, glancing past her. "I heard about Gwen. Thought you’d stay longer."

Evelyn’s smile tightened. "Work called me back."

Theo’s gaze flickered to Daniel. "Ah. I’ll catch you later, then." He stepped around her into the elevator.

The doors sealed shut.

Daniel’s voice cut through the quiet. "You two haven’t spoken since leaving?"

Evelyn dug for her keys, avoiding his eyes. "You heard him."

Daniel’s jaw tightened.

So she hadn’t been whispering to Theo all night.

Had he… misjudged her?
###Chapter 469

Evelyn swung the door open. When she turned and caught Daniel's vacant stare, her brows knitted together. "Get inside."

Daniel's piercing gaze locked onto her. "About last night—"

"Enough." Evelyn cut him off sharply. "Daniel, whether you remember or not is irrelevant now. I'm done discussing this." She settled onto the couch and grabbed her laptop. "We need to talk about something else."

Daniel's eyes narrowed as he stepped inside, shutting the door behind him.

"These are your men, correct?" Evelyn pulled up the files Nathan had sent her, displaying surveillance photos on the screen.

Daniel's forehead creased. "Yes."

But he hadn't seen these particular bodyguards in weeks—not since Gregory had requisitioned them upon returning to Silvercrest Manor. His father had claimed to need assistance with unspecified matters. As family, Daniel hadn't questioned it.

He never expected Evelyn to obtain these images. "What's this about? What did they do?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply before meeting his gaze. "You know I raised Liam and Sophia alone overseas before returning to Willowbrook. Nathan is like family to us—he practically helped raise them."

Daniel remained silent, his expression unreadable.

"When Nathan learned what Serena did to the twins... let's just say he didn't take it well."

Daniel's eyebrow arched. "He's targeting me to avenge my own children?"

"Exactly." Evelyn tapped the screen, revealing new images. "Because he discovered your men have been protecting Serena this whole time."

Daniel's entire body went rigid. "That's impossible."

He'd personally exiled Serena abroad on Grace's recommendation—a fitting punishment for someone who'd nearly killed his children. Her survival meant nothing to him.

"See for yourself." Evelyn swiped through damning photos showing his bodyguards shielding Serena, even clashing with Nathan's operatives.

"Coincidentally, you sent her straight into Nathan's territory. When he moved against her, your men intervened." Her voice turned icy. "Care to explain, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel's jaw tightened. Was this Gregory's so-called "business"?

Noticing his darkening expression, Evelyn's lips curled in disdain. "Seems your children matter less than your ex-fiancée after all."

"You claim to have punished Serena, yet secretly provide her protection?" She leaned back, eyes flashing. "That's not punishment—that's a luxury vacation."

Crossing her legs, Evelyn delivered her ultimatum with chilling calm. "If Serena's safety outweighs Liam and Sophia's suffering, then hand them back to me. We'll return overseas and erase you from our lives. Permanently."

For a long moment, Daniel simply stared at her. Then, unexpectedly, he laughed.
###Chapter 470

Daniel stretched lazily on the plush sofa, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "You really came all this way just to demand the kids back?" His voice dripped with amusement. "Let's not forget—while Liam and Emily call you Mommy, Diana and I remain their biological parents."

The air grew thick with tension.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, a bitter laugh escaping her lips. "When their own flesh and blood can't be bothered to protect them, why force those children to stay with you?"

Daniel's eyebrow arched. He turned fully toward her, his dark eyes burning into hers.

Just as Evelyn began squirming under his scrutiny, he finally spoke. "I do care about Liam and Emily. Those men guarding Serena? Not my doing."

"Then explain these photos." Her fingers curled into fists, nails biting into her palms. How dare he play innocent? Did he think fatherhood granted him the right to endanger his own children?

"If you can't even keep them safe, you forfeit any claim to being their parents!"

A smirk played on Daniel's lips as he plucked his phone from the coffee table. "Come upstairs," he ordered into the receiver.

Five minutes later, Ethan burst in, breathless. "You needed me, sir?"

Daniel gestured toward the laptop without shifting from his sprawled position. "Take a look."

Ethan frowned, stepping closer to examine the screen. "Wait—isn't that Caleb and his team?" He scrolled through the images, confusion deepening. "They're overseas? I thought Mr. Blackwood reassigned them months ago. Did he send them abroad?" Scratching his head, Ethan turned back to Daniel. "Why show me this? Did they mess up?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. She stared at Ethan, voice trembling. "You're saying...who commands these men now?"

Ethan gave her an odd look. "Obviously Gregory Blackwood." His gaze darted between them. "What's going on?"

Evelyn's lips parted soundlessly. The blood drained from her face.

Serena's guards...were Gregory's doing? Daniel had no part in this?

Daniel watched the realization dawn on her with visible satisfaction. "Dismissed," he told Ethan.

"But sir—"

A single glare silenced him. Ethan retreated, closing the door with exaggerated care.

Silence swallowed the room whole.

Evelyn's cheeks burned under Daniel's unrelenting stare. Every second stretched into eternity before she finally choked out, "Why would your father protect Serena?"

"That," Daniel drawled, crossing his ankles, "requires investigation." His eyes gleamed with triumph. "Now tell me, Evelyn—do I still fail as a father?"
###Chapter 471

The tension in the room was so thick it could choke a person.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and met Daniel's piercing gaze. "Fine, I misjudged you. But—" She squared her shoulders. "It's not entirely my fault. Those men used to work for you, didn't they?"

Daniel gave a slow nod. "They did. But that's not the point, Evelyn." His voice was calm, but his eyes burned with intensity. "You're Liam and Sophia's adoptive mother. I appreciate how much you care for them. But remember—they are Diana's and my children first. You don’t get to decide whether we're fit to be their parents."

A smirk curled his lips. "Take this situation. I didn’t send those men to guard Serena. But even if I had, what right do you and Nathan have to confront me about it?"

Evelyn went rigid. His words were like ice water dumped over her, freezing her in place.

Each syllable was a knife twisting in her chest.

Liam and Sophia were hers. She had carried them, birthed them, loved them before anyone else. But no one knew that. And now, Daniel looked at her like she was nothing more than an overstepping outsider.

"You don’t get to decide whether we're fit to be their parents."

He was right. In the eyes of the world, she was just the woman who had stolen someone else’s children. What claim did she have?

Her face paled, fingers curling into fists at her sides.

Daniel frowned at the raw pain flashing across her expression. He sighed. "I know you’re just protective of them. So I’ll let this slide—once. There won’t be a next time."

Evelyn shut her eyes and nodded, the motion stiff.

Seeing her distress, Daniel didn’t press further. Instead, he cleared his throat, shifting topics abruptly. "I reviewed the reports you prepared this morning. Impressive work, especially considering you weren’t feeling well."

His tone turned professional. "You’re an asset to the company. As your employer, I expect your focus to remain on work for now."

A pause. Then, softer: "Liam and Sophia will stay at Silvercrest Manor. If you want to see them, you’re welcome to visit."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She bit her lip, fighting back the protest on her tongue. In the end, all she managed was a brittle, "Fine."

What else could she say? Daniel had made his decision.

And why wouldn’t he? To him, she was just the stand-in.

Daniel hadn’t expected such quick compliance. He studied her for a long moment before standing. "I moved your meeting to tomorrow. Rest today. I won’t tolerate another fainting episode."

With that, he strode out, the door slamming shut behind him.

Evelyn stayed rooted to the spot, staring at the closed door, her thoughts a storm.

Daniel didn’t head home after leaving Lakeside Residences. Instead, he had Ethan arrange a dinner at Willowbrook’s most exclusive restaurant—with Gregory Blackwood.

"I must say, I’m surprised by the invitation," Gregory remarked as he settled into the private booth. He swirled his wine glass, amused. "Finally acting like a proper son, are we?"

Daniel smirked. "Don’t flatter yourself." He tossed a folder onto the table. "Remember when you asked to borrow some of my men? Said you needed them for ‘personal matters’?"

The photos inside showed the same guards Evelyn had confronted him about.

Daniel leaned forward, eyes sharp. "Care to explain why they’re tailing Serena Hart?"
###Chapter 472

"Do you know what they've been up to overseas?"

Gregory Blackwood's brow furrowed as he picked up the photographs scattered across the table. The faces were familiar—his son Daniel's personal security team. But...

"I don't." Gregory set the images down with deliberate calm. "As I recall, once you assigned these men to me, their deployment became my decision." He reclined in his chair, the leather creaking as he leveled an icy stare at Daniel. "A friend required assistance. I provided it. Is there an issue?"

Daniel poured himself a generous measure of bourbon, swirling the amber liquid with practiced elegance. His aristocratic bearing radiated quiet menace. "Which friend? Dennis Prescott?"

Gregory's jaw tightened, but he remained silent.

"Thought so." Daniel's lips curled into a humorless smile. "Tell me, Father—do you know why Dennis needed my men?"

Gregory stilled, his gaze sharpening.

Daniel took a measured sip before answering his own question. "He deployed them to protect Serena."

A muscle twitched in Gregory's temple. Though he couldn't fathom why Dennis would safeguard Daniel's former fiancée, he forced a derisive chuckle. "Isn't she your ex? What's wrong with him looking out for her?"

"You're shockingly uninformed about your own family." The crystal glass hit the table with a decisive clink. "Had you bothered to investigate, you'd know why Serena was exiled overseas under penalty of never returning." Daniel's expression hardened. "You claim to adore Liam and Emily, yet remain oblivious that Serena once tried to murder them."

Gregory's complexion drained of color. This was news to him.

"Then..." Confusion flickered across Gregory's features. "Why would Prescott send your men to guard her?"

"Either Serena's connected to the Prescotts, or they commissioned her to eliminate my heirs." Daniel's chuckle held no warmth. "You truly knew nothing of this?"

Gregory's hands clenched. Years of nomadic travel had kept him detached from family affairs. His childhood friendship with Dennis had faded into distant acquaintance—he hadn't the slightest inkling of the man's recent activities.

"My suspicions are confirmed." Daniel's voice dripped with contempt. "Serena attempted to kill Evelyn Carter's children—my children—and now appears entangled with the Prescotts. Yet Dennis covertly borrowed my security detail to protect her."

Gregory looked ill.

Daniel raised his glass in mocking toast, tapping it against Gregory's untouched drink. "Since you're clearly out of the loop, consider this your notice to abstain from the Blackwood-Prescott feud. Stop harassing Evelyn on their behalf. She's the woman who raised Liam and Emily as her own. You?" His lip curled. "You're just the grandfather who couldn't be bothered to care."

He downed the bourbon in one smooth motion and rose. "We're done here. Enjoy your dinner, Father."

As Daniel turned to leave, Gregory finally found his voice. "This entire confrontation—it's retaliation for me striking Evelyn last night, isn't it?" A bitter laugh escaped him. "Tell me, Daniel—have you fallen for the nanny?"
###Chapter 473

Daniel halted mid-step, his lips twisting into a mocking grin. "Just because I'm defending Evelyn, you assume I've fallen for her?" He scoffed, then tilted his head. "What about you, Dad? You're awfully protective of Vivian. Does that mean you're in love with her?"

Gregory's face darkened instantly. He slammed his palms against the desk, his voice a thunderous roar. "How dare you speak to me like that, Daniel? Dennis and I have been friends for decades! Vivian was like a daughter to me!" His chest heaved with fury. "And she's gone—how could you even suggest something so vile?"

Daniel let out a low chuckle. "No one knows for sure if she's really dead, but..." He turned, casting a cold glance over his shoulder. "I learned this from you, Father."

Gregory's breath came in ragged gasps, his face flushing with rage. "You insolent brat! Is this how you speak to your own father?"

"If I'm a brat," Daniel shot back, "what does that make you, Master Blackwood?" Without waiting for a reply, he strode out, the door slamming shut behind him.

Gregory's fury erupted. He overturned the table with a violent crash, dishes shattering across the floor.

Lakeside Residences

Evelyn sat curled on the sofa, sketchpad balanced on her knees as she listened to her children's voices through her earpiece.

"Isabelle's dinner was actually good tonight!" Sophia chirped, her voice bright. "Not as good as yours, Mommy, but way better than Diana's!"

Liam snorted. "I could probably cook better than Diana." Then, after a pause, he added excitedly, "Oliver, guess what? Isabelle taught me a few new recipes. I'll make them for you when you're better!"

A soft laugh came from Oliver’s end. "Why wait till then?"

Liam giggled. "Because I don’t want my cooking to make you sicker."

Evelyn sighed, shaking her head. "So are you good at cooking or not?"

Liam hummed thoughtfully. "I’m decent. But you might regret eating it later."

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. She shifted, stretching her legs before returning to her sketch. "It’s already nine. You three should get to bed. Since I won’t be there anymore, you and Sophia need to look after each other, okay? No staying up late."

Silence. Then, after a long moment, Liam’s voice turned small. "Mommy… did you really promise Daniel you wouldn’t see us again?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Yes. But I’ve made that promise before, haven’t I? It’ll be fine."

"It’s different now!" Sophia burst out. "That horrible woman is going to be watching us!"

Evelyn’s chest tightened. She opened her mouth, but no words came.

"She’s going to be awful when Daddy’s not home!" Sophia continued, her voice trembling.

Liam frowned. "Sophia, don’t say things like that. It’s not Mommy’s fault."

"But—"

"I’ll handle it," Oliver cut in smoothly before their bickering could escalate. "Just wait for my plan."
###Chapter 474

Evelyn Carter held her breath as Oliver and Sophia fell silent at Daniel's words.

She exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples. "I'll figure something out." After soothing the children, she ended the call, exhaustion weighing on her.

Sophia wasn't wrong. Diana might not dare to harm them like before, but she'd make their lives at Silvercrest Manor unbearable.

With Daniel present, Diana wouldn't act recklessly. But what about when he wasn't around?

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. There was only one solution.

She dialed Daniel.

His voice was clipped when he answered. "What is it?"

No pleasantries. Straight to business. "You mentioned Diana's been studying jewelry design independently, correct?"

Daniel leaned back in his car seat, eyes shut. "Yes. Why?"

Evelyn chewed her lip. "I need an assistant. Rather than hiring someone new, why not bring Diana into the company? As your wife, she'd prioritize Blackwood Corporation's interests."

She continued before he could interrupt. "This project will take months. When it's done, I'll let her take full credit. It'll prove she's more than just a pretty face. You can transfer her to any department afterward."

This was her only way to protect Liam and Sophia. If Diana was busy at work, she wouldn't have time to torment them.

Two or three months should be enough—enough time to conceive Daniel's child.

And if she didn't? Well, she'd find another excuse to get the kids away from Silvercrest Manor.

"You'd hand Diana your hard-earned success?" Daniel's grip on the phone tightened. "That's not like you."

This wasn't just any project. It was Blackwood Corporation's chance to revitalize their jewelry division. The stakes were high, the rewards even higher.

Evelyn's reputation would skyrocket if she pulled it off.

So why give it away?

"I owe her," Evelyn said lightly. "For taking her children. Discuss it with her tonight. If she agrees, she can start tomorrow. I'll assign her the simplest tasks."

A beat of silence. Then—

"Why?" Daniel's voice dropped. "Given your history, why help her?"

Evelyn's fingers turned white around her phone. "Why do you think?"

Another pause. Then a low, knowing chuckle.

"You think if Diana isn't occupied, she'll make Liam and Sophia's lives hell."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Damn him. He saw right through her.

She swallowed hard. "Call it paranoia, but—"

"No." His voice was final. "Diana isn't working under you."
###Chapter 475

The flicker of hope in Evelyn's eyes died the moment Daniel spoke. Her fingers trembled around the phone.

She forced a slow breath, steadying her voice. "Mr. Blackwood, whether you think I'm overreacting or not, I have my reasons."

"If I give Diana full credit for my work, isn’t that a win for both of you? She could join Blackwood Corporation without anyone questioning her qualifications—"

Daniel leaned back in his car seat, a low chuckle escaping him. "If I want my wife in my company, I don’t need to justify it to anyone."

Evelyn’s grip tightened.

His voice dropped, colder now. "She’s my wife. She can have any position I choose for her. She doesn’t need your work to prove herself."

The words struck like a physical blow.

He was right.

If Daniel wanted Diana as CEO, he could make it happen with a single word. No one would dare oppose him.

A memory surfaced—one from when they were newly married.

Back then, Evelyn had begged to work at Blackwood Corporation. She wanted to stand by his side, to support him in every way.

But Daniel had refused. He claimed it would invite gossip, that she needed real qualifications first. A good CEO, he’d said, doesn’t hire based on personal ties.

She had believed him. She’d spent years improving herself, desperate to earn his approval.

How naïve she’d been.

"Fine. Never mind." She ended the call without another word. There was no point arguing.

Evelyn tossed her phone aside and tried to sleep, but rest wouldn’t come. All night, she turned over possibilities—ways to protect Liam and Emily from Diana’s cruelty. She scribbled plans, only to cross them out one by one.

There was only one solution.

She had to save them herself.

Dawn found her drifting into a fitful sleep—only to jerk awake from a nightmare.

In it, Diana had poisoned the children. They wasted away before her eyes, dying the moment they returned to her arms.

Her pillow was soaked with tears.

She sat up, clutching it tightly, staring at the pale morning light.

Escape was impossible. Not yet. Not until she carried Daniel’s child.

She had to save Oliver.

Even if it killed her.

8:00 AM

Evelyn pushed open her office door, exhaustion weighing her down.

"You’re five minutes from being late."

The icy voice made her freeze.

She looked up.

Diana lounged in her chair, dressed in blood-red, a smirk playing on her lips. "This office is mine now."

With a flick of her wrist, she sent Evelyn’s files scattering across the floor.

"Clean this up. I don’t want your trash in my space."
###Chapter 476

"This office is mine now."

Evelyn froze. After a long pause, her eyes lit up with delight. "You're joining the team?"

Diana shot her an icy glare. "Obviously!"

She had no idea why Daniel had suddenly ordered her to work in Evelyn's department—as her assistant, no less. She'd been sleeping peacefully when he yanked her out of bed and demanded she report to work immediately. She was furious but didn’t dare argue.

What infuriated her most were his instructions. He’d made it clear she had to follow Evelyn’s orders without question.

And the worst part? He forbade her from taking credit for Evelyn’s work after the project’s completion.

It made no sense. She was the CEO’s wife! How could she be reduced to a mere assistant, especially under Evelyn?

Though her title was "assistant," Diana knew the truth—she’d be handling all the grunt work Evelyn didn’t want or have time for. No arriving late, no leaving early. If Evelyn stayed late, so would she.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. With a sharp flick of her wrist, she swept the remaining items off Evelyn’s desk. "Get rid of this junk! I don’t want any of it near me!"

Evelyn’s mood brightened at Diana’s frustration. Smiling, she knelt and began gathering the scattered documents. "What position did Mr. Blackwood assign you?"

Diana scoffed. "Your assistant."

Assistant?

Cassandra, who had been lingering outside, finally stepped in. She helped Evelyn collect the papers and remarked pointedly, "With that attitude, I thought you were here to replace the director. Turns out you’re just an assistant."

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered as she continued picking up the mess. "Mind your words."

Secretly, she was thrilled Diana would be working under her. This way, she could keep an eye on her instead of letting her hover around the kids at home.

"Director Carter, you're too kind," Cassandra muttered, organizing the documents. "I’ve never met an assistant with such a temper. Who throws their boss’s files on the floor?"

Diana’s face darkened. "What did you just say?" She stalked toward them in her stilettos. "Remember who I am. This company belongs to my husband—and me. I could have you fired with a snap of my fingers!"

Cassandra clenched her jaw at Diana’s arrogance. Though furious, she bit back her words, finished gathering the papers, and swiftly left.

Evelyn stacked the documents neatly and smiled. "Do you want this office? It’s yours if you prefer. I’ll move outside."

Diana rolled her eyes and stood. "As if I’d want this pathetic little space."

As she rose, her gaze landed on a framed photo on Evelyn’s desk—a picture of her and Liam. He looked paler in the photo than in real life.

Diana’s lips curled as she picked it up. "Liam looks good here."

Evelyn’s eyes widened in alarm. "Put that down."

"Why should I?" Diana sneered before slamming the frame onto the floor. Then, with deliberate cruelty, she ground her heel into the glass, shattering the smiling faces beneath.

She covered her mouth in mock surprise. "Oops! I accidentally broke your precious photo!"
###Chapter 477

Evelyn moved like lightning, shoving Diana out of the way.

The glass frame shattered into a thousand pieces. The photo beneath showed a gaping hole where Diana's stiletto had crushed Evelyn's face.

Only Oliver's half remained untouched.

This was the last photo Evelyn had taken with Oliver before returning to Willowbrook. Whenever exhaustion threatened to consume her, this single image had been her lifeline—her reason to keep fighting.

Now...

Her fingers trembled as she gathered the broken fragments. A shard sliced her skin, but she barely registered the pain. Blood smeared across the photo as she carefully tucked it into her pocket.

"Director Carter..." Employees hovered at her office door, torn between concern and hesitation.

Diana's lips curled in satisfaction at Evelyn's devastation. "It's just a picture with Liam. What's the big deal? You can take another one. He's at Silvercrest Manor right now!" Her voice dripped with mock sweetness. "I'll even let you take as many as you want. Stop being so dramatic."

Evelyn's head snapped up. Fire burned in her eyes. "Get. Out."

Diana scoffed. "Who do you think you're talking to? I may be an assistant, but I'm still Daniel's wife—"

"And I said get out!" Evelyn's voice cracked like a whip.

This was the final straw.

She'd tolerated Diana trashing her office, stealing her space, scattering her files—because at least it kept her away from Liam and Emily. But this...

"You'll regret this, Evelyn!" Diana spat. "Just wait until I get home. I'll—"

"What exactly will you do?" A cold voice cut through the air.

Diana froze. Then, with practiced ease, she flung herself into Daniel's arms, tears welling instantly. "Daniel! Evelyn was horrible to me! She threw me out!"

Her voice trembled. "You sent me here to work, so I came early. I didn't know what to do, so I waited in her office. The frame slipped—it was an accident! But she lost her mind over some stupid photo with Liam!"

Daniel peeled her off with icy precision. "I heard everything."

Diana went rigid. "Daniel...?"

His gaze could have frozen hell. "You destroyed her property deliberately. Used your title to threaten her. This morning, you promised to take this seriously. Was that a lie?"

Her face drained of color.

Ethan sighed from the doorway. "Ma'am, if you'd just stayed quiet... Sir came specifically to check on you. He said it was the first time you'd shown initiative." A pause. "Then we walked in on you terrorizing Director Carter's office."

Diana's teeth sank into her lip. How long had he been listening?

"Evelyn."
###Chapter 478

Daniel stepped forward, his hand outstretched toward Evelyn. "Hand me the photo."

Evelyn's brows knitted together as she took a step back. She knew Daniel probably wanted to help her repair the torn picture to make up for Diana's actions, but...

This wasn't just any photo.

It was a cherished memory of her and Oliver.

Daniel had seen it before, but he'd never looked closely. If she gave it to him now, and he restored it...

She couldn't risk him realizing the boy in the photo wasn't Liam, as he'd always assumed.

Daniel didn't know about Oliver. The moment he'd discovered Liam and Sophia's true identities, he'd taken them from her.

She couldn't lose Oliver too.

"I just want to help," Daniel said, his voice firm as he took another step toward her.

Evelyn shook her head. "I can handle it myself—"

"Evelyn." His tone darkened. "Do I need to take it from you?"

She froze, meeting his piercing gaze.

His dark eyes burned with unreadable emotions. She bit her lip, hesitating, but after a tense silence, she reluctantly surrendered the photo.

The image was smeared with Evelyn's blood—a snapshot of her and Liam smiling together. But now, a jagged tear marred Evelyn's face.

Daniel studied it, his sharp eyes narrowing.

Something was off.

The boy in the photo didn't quite look like Liam. Just like the picture he'd seen in Evelyn's apartment, this child appeared paler, frailer—more solemn than Liam ever was.

A suspicion flickered in his mind.

Was this really Liam?

Or was it someone else entirely?

But the thought vanished as quickly as it came. Impossible. Liam and Sophia were twins. There couldn't be another child who looked exactly like Liam.

With a quiet exhale, Daniel pocketed the photo. "If this means so much to you, I'll have it restored," he said. Then, his gaze dropped to her injured finger. "Are you hurt?"

Evelyn pulled her hand back, hiding the blood. "It's nothing."

Daniel studied her for a long moment, as if debating whether to push further. But in the end, he turned and strode out of the office.

The second the door closed behind him, he stopped. "Ethan."

"Yes, sir?" Ethan responded immediately.

"Get a first-aid kit and tend to Evelyn's hand. Then find me a photo restoration expert."

"Right away."

Daniel's cold gaze shifted to Diana. "My office. Now."

Diana swallowed hard, her fingers twisting together as she followed him silently. She hadn't expected Daniel to show up in the design department today—if she'd known, she never would have acted out like this!

They rode the elevator to the top floor in tense silence. Once inside his office, Daniel shut the door and took his seat behind the imposing desk. His steel-gray eyes locked onto Diana.

"Explain yourself. Why target Evelyn? Is this because I forced you to work here?"
###Chapter 479

"No... Of course not." Diana pressed her lips together, her eyes glistening with unshed tears as she gazed at Daniel with a pleading expression. "I wasn't upset with you. If anything, I'm grateful for the opportunity to work at Blackwood Group. I know you brought me here because you didn’t want me sitting idle at home, and because you wanted me to adjust to the company for our future together. But..."

Daniel's sharp eyes narrowed. "But what?"

Diana exhaled shakily, her fingers twisting together. "I was afraid that starting at the bottom would make the other employees look down on me. Even as the CEO’s wife, I’d still have to prove myself from scratch..." She wiped at her damp lashes. "Daniel, you know my background. I grew up in an ordinary family in Mariner’s Cove. I’ve always felt... inadequate."

A frown creased Daniel’s brow as he studied her trembling frame. After a long pause, he finally relented. "You're right. Working with someone as experienced as Evelyn might be too much for you right now." He leaned back in his chair. "I’ll have her assign you simpler tasks."

His dark gaze pinned her in place. "I understand why you acted out earlier. You wanted to assert your authority, to demand respect. But..." His voice turned icy. "Did you really break Evelyn’s photo frame by accident?"

Evelyn’s desk was cluttered with items. Yet Diana had managed to destroy the one thing that mattered—the photograph of Liam. And then she had stepped on it, leaving a hole right over Evelyn’s face.

Daniel wasn’t a fool. This was no accident.

Diana swallowed hard, then confessed in a whisper, "I did it on purpose."

Daniel arched a brow, waiting.

"I was jealous," she admitted, her voice thick with emotion. "Evelyn has so many memories with Liam, but I have nothing. She can display their picture proudly, but what do I have? Liam still refuses to call me Mommy, let alone take a photo with me." She looked up, her expression raw with vulnerability.

"I know it was wrong, but I couldn’t help it. He’s my son. Seeing how close he is to Evelyn—it kills me."

"You were absent for most of his life," Daniel said coolly, drumming his fingers against the polished wood. "And even now that he’s back, you’ve done little to truly bond with him."

Diana’s lips trembled. "Because I never got the chance—"

A sharp knock interrupted her.

Ethan’s voice filtered through the door. "Mr. Blackwood, the photo restoration expert has arrived."

Daniel acknowledged him with a curt nod before turning back to Diana. "Get back to work. And remember—if Liam isn’t close to you, that’s your fault, not Evelyn’s. Don’t ever let personal grudges interfere with your job again."

Diana nodded stiffly and turned to leave.

Just as her hand touched the doorknob, Daniel’s voice stopped her cold.

"One more thing." His tone was deceptively calm. "Are you absolutely certain you only gave birth to two children back then?"

Diana’s blood turned to ice.
###Chapter 480

Evelyn spun around, shooting Daniel a bewildered glance. "Didn't I... give birth to two kids?"

Was one of them adopted?

A bitter laugh escaped Daniel the moment he saw her confusion. He'd been wrong after all.

Evelyn gave him another puzzled look before finally leaving the room.

At the design department.

Serena's finger was wrapped in a bandage. She stood outside her office, directing Cassandra and the others to find an empty desk for Evelyn.

Spotting Evelyn's return, Serena glanced at her. "Since my office doesn't suit you, I've arranged for a spacious desk. For now, just observe how the department operates and get to know your colleagues."

Evelyn rolled her eyes, dropping into the seat with a thud. She flashed Serena a mocking smile. "How thoughtful of you, Director Serena."

Serena frowned but said nothing, turning to enter her office instead.

To her surprise, Evelyn immediately followed, shutting the door behind them. Her voice turned icy. "Serena."

Serena turned, arching a brow. "Problem?"

"Liam and Sophia. One of them is adopted, isn't they?" Serena's frown deepened. "Why ask me this now?"

"Just answer. Yes or no?" Evelyn exhaled sharply, lowering her voice. "Daniel just asked if I was sure I'd had two children."

Serena's breath hitched.

Daniel wouldn't ask that randomly. Not after taking her photo...

A cold dread settled in her stomach. She bit her lip, staring at Evelyn. "What did you say?"

"The truth, obviously." Evelyn scoffed. "Tell me—did you adopt one of them? I always thought they were both yours. If not, I need to know which one!"

Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "If Daniel finds out I'm not the real Serena Hart, I'll ruin you and those kids."

Serena exhaled slowly. "They're both mine. Relax."

"Good." Evelyn rolled her eyes and stormed out, slamming the door.

Serena sank into her chair, staring blankly at the door.

Daniel knew something. Otherwise, he wouldn't have asked that question.

A shiver ran down her spine as she hugged herself.

If Daniel discovered Oliver's existence...

She couldn't even fathom the consequences.

If he found out, she'd lose everything.

The morning passed in a haze, every second filled with dread that Daniel would summon her and demand answers.

Finally, noon arrived. As she packed up for lunch, her phone rang.

Daniel's cold voice cut through. "My office. Now. The photo's being restored, but we need to talk."
###Chapter 481

Evelyn had no desire to seek out Daniel, yet her feet carried her upstairs to his door anyway. Her knuckles rapped against the wood before she could reconsider.

"Come in." His voice was ice through the door.

She inhaled sharply and turned the knob. "Mr. Blackwood."

Daniel barely glanced up from his desk before motioning dismissively. "Sit."

"I'll stand." Her fingers curled into her palms. "It's lunchtime. Whatever this is, make it quick."

The words tasted like fear. If he'd discovered Oliver's existence, she wanted this over with—no drawn-out torture, no cruel games.

To Daniel, her clipped tone read as petulance. His dark eyes studied her. "Still upset about this morning?"

That morning when Diana had humiliated her in front of the entire office. When Daniel had barely lifted a finger to stop it because appearances mattered more than justice.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "You said the photo was ready. Is there anything else?"

His jaw tightened but he slid the restored picture across the desk. Her hands shook as she picked it up.

No trace remained of Diana's stiletto mark. The restoration specialist had gone further—adding color to Oliver's cheeks until he looked vibrantly alive, almost indistinguishable from Liam.

Her throat closed. This was how Oliver looked before the illness stole his spark. Healthy. Whole.

"I have questions about this photo." Daniel leaned back in his chair. "When I stayed at Lakeside Residences, I saw an album with Liam wearing the same hospital gown. I even took him for tests afterward. The results were clean—just a flu, like you said."

He stood abruptly and plucked the photo from her grasp, tapping Oliver's wristband. "Then why does this say Hematology?"

The air left her lungs.

Her gaze dropped to the damning evidence. Oliver had painstakingly photoshopped those words out years ago. Liam and Emily had praised his attention to detail.

Now the truth glared back at her in high definition.

"The restoration specialist noticed editing marks." Daniel's voice was lethally calm. "He undid them. Care to explain why my son was in Hematology for a simple flu?"

Evelyn shut her eyes against his piercing stare.
###Chapter 482

Evelyn inhaled deeply before forcing a smile.

"I was overreacting, that's all."

Daniel's brows lifted slightly as he studied her expression in silence.

With a light laugh, Evelyn continued, "Liam once had a nosebleed from the flu. I'd read about leukemia patients being diagnosed after uncontrolled bleeding, so I panicked and rushed him to the hematology department for tests." She shrugged, feigning nonchalance. "Turned out it was just the flu. A false alarm."

She added casually, "Plenty of flu cases get hospitalized in winter, so the doctor kept us there overnight."

Daniel narrowed his eyes. "That's it?"

"Obviously. Nothing more to it." Evelyn chuckled dryly, snatching the photo from his hands before turning away.

Daniel remained seated, watching her retreating figure with narrowed eyes.

The photo restoration specialist's words echoed in his mind—

"Why was only the department name edited out? What were they trying to hide?"

His jaw tightened.

If it was truly just a misunderstanding, there was no reason to erase the hematology department's name. A simple explanation would've sufficed.

But the opposite had happened.

Daniel reopened Liam's last medical report, flipping through the pages with growing suspicion.

What were Evelyn and Liam hiding?

At lunch, Evelyn picked at her food absently.

She planned to nap in her office afterward, but the moment she stepped into the design department, she froze.

Victoria and Richard Sinclair sat on either side of Diana, watching eagerly as she ate the homemade meal they'd brought.

"Diana, is it good? We made all your favorites."

"We neglected you so much before, yet you still helped us. You even convinced Mr. Blackwood to assist us."

"Tell us what you'd like tomorrow, sweetheart. We'll prepare anything."

Evelyn's fingers curled at their fawning.

Diana, wearing Evelyn's old face, basked in their attention. The sight twisted something inside her.

Then Diana glanced up and spotted Evelyn.

With a bright smile, she called out, "Director Carter! Have you eaten? Come join us—try my parents' cooking!"

Evelyn stiffened.

Before she could respond, Victoria scoffed. "She doesn't deserve our food."

Richard nodded eagerly. "This is for you only, Diana."

Diana sighed dramatically. "Mom, Dad..." She shot Evelyn a pitying look. "You probably don’t know this, but Evelyn grew up with parents who never cared for her. They adored her younger sister but treated her like an afterthought."

She tilted her head. "Her mother knew her favorite dishes but never bothered to make them. Pathetic, isn’t it?"

Victoria sneered. "She must’ve deserved it. A worthless girl like her? No wonder they ignored her."
###Chapter 483

Evelyn's fingers curled into tight fists behind her back.

Diana smirked, deliberately speaking loud enough for Richard and Victoria to hear. "It's no wonder your parents never loved you." The couple nodded in agreement, their faces twisted with disdain as they added, "You never deserved their affection anyway."

The absurdity of the moment made Evelyn's lips twitch with bitter amusement.

She inhaled sharply, brushing past them without another word as she marched toward her office.

Just as her hand grasped the doorknob, Diana's mocking laughter rang out. "Not joining us, Ms. Carter? Mom cooked all my favorite dishes—there's enough to feed an army!"

Each word struck like a dagger to Evelyn's chest.

Back when she was still Evelyn Sinclair, Richard and Victoria had always prioritized Serena. First pick of everything—even meals.

Unless she was ill, Victoria rarely bothered making Evelyn's preferred dishes.

Only when Serena remained overseas did this wretched couple remember they had another daughter.

And now they poured all their misplaced affection onto an imposter wearing her face.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, keeping her back turned as she retorted, "Since your dear parents went through so much trouble, you should savor every bite. Wouldn't want to disappoint them."

The office door clicked shut behind her.

Diana's smirk widened as she studied the rigid line of Evelyn's retreating shoulders. The facade of composure was cracking—she could see it in the tension radiating from Evelyn's frame.

Taking a delicate bite of pasta, Diana turned to Victoria with saccharine sweetness. "Mom, you should bring lunch more often."

Victoria's face lit up with pathetic eagerness. "Of course, darling! I'm so sorry for neglecting you before... Seeing you enjoy my cooking means everything!"

When Victoria pulled her into an embrace, Diana's expression briefly twisted with revulsion before smoothing into a smile.

She pulled back, patting Victoria's arm. "Don't celebrate yet, Mom." Her gaze flickered toward Evelyn's closed door. "We'll have plenty more reasons to rejoice soon."

The following weeks became a blur of relentless work.

Evelyn barely slept, surviving on coffee and sheer willpower. From dawn till midnight, her world narrowed to design sketches and production timelines.

Daniel had demanded an entire jewelry collection designed in one month, with prototypes completed within three. The grand unveiling at Willowbrook's fashion week loomed in four months.

Her preliminary designs were finally taking shape. But as she presented her progress to the team, an unexpected interruption shattered the meeting's focus.

"Director Carter."

Audrey Sinclair—Daniel's former secretary who bore an uncanny resemblance to Evelyn—stood abruptly. After Diana's return, Audrey had transferred to the design department as Cassandra's assistant.

Now she held up her phone, displaying a viral social media post. "This surfaced last night. A seventeen-year-old prodigy named Marcus Sterling posted these concept sketches, seeking investors."

Her finger tapped the screen, enlarging an image that made Evelyn's blood run cold.

Audrey's gaze turned accusatory. "These are identical to your designs, Director Carter."

The room plunged into stunned silence.

With calculated cruelty, Audrey continued, "I've watched you work tirelessly these past weeks. But copying someone's rough drafts? That only takes a few hours, doesn't it?"

"Are you out of your mind?"
###Chapter 484

Evelyn's eyes narrowed as she snatched the phone from Audrey's hands.

Her gaze flickered between the design displayed on the massive screen and Marcus Sterling's published draft.

Silence.

The similarities were…uncanny. Nearly identical.

Around the conference table, the others scrambled to search for Marcus Sterling—the so-called teenage prodigy.

When the results loaded, the room went deathly still.

Evelyn took her phone back from Arianna, her assistant. Her brows knitted together in a deep frown.

Every line, every detail—it was a carbon copy of her original sketch.

In all her years as a designer, she had faced plagiarism before.

But never like this.

Never with the stolen work published before hers, flaunted so brazenly in the public eye.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Marcus Sterling's motive was clear—he wanted to claim ownership of her designs before she could.

"Director Carter," Diana's saccharine voice cut through the murmurs, "what's going on?"

The woman blinked innocently from across the room. "We all saw how hard you worked. How could your draft match a seventeen-year-old genius's work so perfectly?"

Evelyn's instincts flared.

She had known something was off.

Diana hadn’t made a move in weeks—no petty schemes, no attempts to undermine her. Just smug smiles and fake pleasantries.

Now, it made sense.

Plagiarism.

The one accusation that could ruin a designer’s credibility.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying Diana. "Mrs. Blackwood, what do you think happened?"

Diana smiled sweetly. "There’s no such thing as coincidence, is there? Either you copied him…or he copied you."

Her eyes gleamed. "Don’t you agree, Director Carter?"

Evelyn said nothing.

But Audrey, standing nearby, frowned. "Marcus Sterling lives in Europa. He has no connections here in Willowbrook. How could he possibly have access to Director Carter’s designs?"

She hesitated. "But his drafts were posted online. Anyone could have copied them."

The implication hung heavy in the air.

Every pair of eyes in the room darted to Evelyn, waiting.

She smiled coolly and rose from her seat.

"I see what you're all thinking. The evidence seems clear—I must have stolen from this so-called prodigy, right?"

Silence.

Their silence was answer enough.

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. "Since you’ve all made up your minds, I’ll have Mr. Blackwood settle this."

Her voice was calm, deliberate.

"The designs were posted last night. So, starting from then, I’ll review every person who entered my office or handled my drafts."

She paused.

"One thing you might not know—I installed hidden cameras near my workstation. Just in case."

Her gaze locked onto Diana.

"Destroying the main office cameras won’t help. I will find out who did this."
###Chapter 485

Daniel was reviewing Emily's latest sketches when Evelyn's call interrupted him.

He couldn't deny Emily's talent, but talent alone wasn't enough. Without Evelyn's expert guidance, the six-year-old wouldn't have produced such remarkable designs.

Still, as impressive as Emily's work was, it lacked the depth and sophistication of Evelyn's creations.

His phone buzzed again. A quick glance at the caller ID lifted his mood. "Done with your meeting?" he answered. "Emily said—"

"Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn's voice was sharp, urgent. "Come to the design department. Now."

Daniel's expression darkened at her tone. "What's wrong?"

"There's a problem." She exhaled sharply. "My designs have been stolen."

A chill ran down his spine.

Without another word, he shut down his computer. "On my way."

The design department's conference room was in chaos when Daniel arrived.

Diana rushed to his side immediately, clutching his arm and pressing close. "Daniel, thank goodness you're here."

His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly before he turned to Evelyn. "Explain."

Evelyn inhaled deeply, summarizing how her designs bore an uncanny resemblance to Marcus Sterling's.

"The issue is—my entire collection, the one I've been working on for weeks, might now be accused of plagiarism."

Daniel scoffed. "Impossible."

He had seen Evelyn's process firsthand—from initial concepts to rough drafts. He'd even contributed suggestions.

This Marcus Sterling—what kind of prodigy could replicate Evelyn's work so precisely?

"That's what I thought," Evelyn said tightly. "Which is why I need your help, Mr. Blackwood."

She turned to Arianna. "Bring my laptop from my office."

Arianna nodded and hurried off.

Minutes later, Evelyn's laptop sat open on the conference table.

"As I mentioned, I had hidden cameras installed in my office." Her gaze flicked to Diana, then Audrey. "If Marcus copied my work, someone took photos of my drafts. I want to know who."

She clicked play on the surveillance footage. Nigel—no, Oliver—had insisted on the cameras, claiming it was necessary.

At the time, Evelyn had dismissed it as paranoia. Who would dare sabotage her in Daniel's company?

Now, she was grateful for his foresight.

The video played, fast-forwarding through days of footage until—

There.

A man slipped into her office during lunch, carefully photographing every sketch.

But the angle hid his face.

The room fell dead silent.
###Chapter 486

All eyes were glued to the screen, desperate to identify the figure captured in the footage.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She didn't need a closer look. Her body turned rigid, fingers digging into the armrests of her chair.

"It's Mrs. Blackwood's father, Richard Sinclair!" Cassandra blurted out, slamming her palm on the table.

Arianna nodded vigorously. "Mr. Sinclair kept calling Director Evelyn horrible names during his visits. I heard him myself."

Daniel's jaw tightened as he turned to Diana.

He could tolerate the Sinclairs' hostility toward Evelyn. He could even overlook their constant suspicion about her identity. But sabotaging Blackwood Corporation's future in the jewelry industry? That crossed every line.

Diana's face drained of color. "Daniel, I... I had no idea," she whispered, tears welling up. "I always told them to be kind to Evelyn. But they wouldn't listen. To think they'd go this far..."

She dabbed at her eyes dramatically before squaring her shoulders. "As the wife of Blackwood Corporation's CEO, I can't condone this. We should report him to the police immediately."

Evelyn's eyes snapped open.

Before seeing the footage, she'd assumed Diana orchestrated the copyright infringement to undermine her. But Richard's appearance changed everything.

This wasn't about plagiarism.

This was about destroying Richard Sinclair.

Evelyn studied Diana's face—the same face she'd worn six years ago.

Serena's parting words echoed in her mind: Richard had another child with his mistress. A sister Evelyn never knew.

Was Diana that sister? Had her own flesh and blood become this twisted?

"Hold the police report," Evelyn said hoarsely. "I want to see him first."
###Chapter 487

Evelyn watched as Diana put on a flawless performance of concern. "Daniel, I really think...we should involve the police."

Her delicate fingers pressed against her chest, eyes glistening with unshed tears. "It breaks my heart that my own father would betray us like this. If I had known his intentions, I would have stopped him."

Then, with calculated precision, Diana turned her gaze toward Evelyn. "You know Director Carter has always had issues with me."

A shaky breath escaped her lips. "Ever since the plagiarism scandal surfaced, she's been watching me like a hawk."

Tears welled in Diana's eyes as she looked pleadingly at Daniel. "I'm afraid Director Carter wants to meet my father alone to manipulate him into implicating innocent people."

She exhaled dramatically. "We should let the authorities handle this immediately. Don't you agree?"

Daniel remained silent.

He sat down, his piercing gaze shifting between Diana and Evelyn before finally speaking in a cold, detached tone. "Diana has a point. Until this matter is resolved, no one—neither Evelyn nor Diana—should meet Richard Sinclair privately."

With a dismissive wave, he addressed Ethan. "Call the police."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

Despite her resentment toward Victoria and Richard for their betrayal, they were still her parents.

She had sworn to cut ties, to stop caring—but twenty years of memories couldn't be erased so easily.

If Richard went to prison for leaking confidential information, he'd be locked away for years.

He was a cheat, a liar, and he deserved punishment.

But what would happen to Victoria afterward?

Evelyn closed her eyes. Just as Ethan reached for the door, she called out.

She lifted her chin, meeting Daniel's gaze head-on. "Mr. Blackwood, is there truly no other way?"

Daniel arched a brow, surprised. "Evelyn, Richard stole your design. If he isn't prosecuted, we can't prove Marcus Sterling plagiarized you. Without that proof, the world will believe you stole from him. Your career in jewelry design would be over."

His words were blunt, laying out the consequences with brutal clarity.

Evelyn bit her lip. "I know, but..."

Her voice wavered. "Richard is still Diana's father. And your father-in-law. There must be another way to expose Marcus."

Daniel's sharp eyes bore into her, as if peeling back every layer of her thoughts.

Evelyn couldn't hold his stare. She looked away. "I just think—"

"This isn't like you." His voice cut through her hesitation. "You don't hesitate when it comes to justice. What are you really thinking?"

Evelyn inhaled sharply. She squared her shoulders and faced him again. "Mr. Blackwood, I just believe we shouldn't be so ruthless. He's still family. If he goes to prison, what happens to your mother-in-law? She has a weak heart—have you considered how this will destroy her?"

Frustrated, she threw the documents onto the table. "Forget it. This is your mess with the Sinclairs. I'm just the victim—what right do I have to interfere?"

Without waiting for a response, Evelyn stormed out, leaving stunned silence in her wake.

Clearly...
###Chapter 488

The roles had suddenly reversed. Evelyn Carter, the true victim, now stood accused while Diana Hart played the grieving daughter of Richard Sinclair.

Daniel Blackwood's piercing gaze followed Evelyn's retreating figure, his brow furrowed in silent contemplation.

"Daniel..." Diana sighed dramatically, clutching his arm with practiced concern. "Why is Evelyn so invested in our family affairs? Since when does she care?"

"Uncharacteristic," Daniel admitted flatly, withdrawing his arm. "Evelyn's always been strictly professional. This sudden emotional interference... doesn't suit her."

His sharp eyes turned to Diana. "Much like how you once claimed unconditional devotion to family, yet now advocate for punishment. Hypocrisy is... puzzling."

Diana's smile faltered.

After a strained pause, she bit her lip in feigned distress. "I'm only doing this for you..." Her eyes darted nervously across his face. "So... what will happen to my father?"

Daniel's jaw tightened. "The plan stands. We file the report."

Evelyn barely registered the taxi ride back to Lakeside Residences.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Theodore Allen's apartment—door ajar, the rich aroma of cured meats wafting through.

Theo materialized instantly, grinning. "Perfect timing. I made carbonara."

"Not hungry," Evelyn muttered, brushing past.

"Exactly why you need to eat." Theo steered her inside with gentle insistence. "Ethan called. Told me what happened at Blackwood Corp."

Evelyn froze.

Her fingers instinctively closed around the pendant at her throat—a sleek silver locket with hidden tech.

"You activated the audio feed again?" Her voice turned icy. "Spying on private meetings now?"

A crackling pause. Then Oliver's sheepish voice echoed through the pendant: "Not spying. Just... monitoring your stress levels."

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Her son's attempt at levity—the forced cheer in his tone—only deepened the ache.

"Liam would've made me laugh by now," Oliver added quietly.

Theo set a heaping plate before her. "Eat. Then we strategize."

Evelyn stared at the food, appetite absent.

"Listen," Theo said firmly, abandoning his fork. "I get it—you don't want your father imprisoned. But if Daniel lets this slide, Richard will escalate. Next time, Blackwood Corp won't recover. Intentions don't matter. Consequences do."

The phone's shrill ring cut through the tension.

Ethan Reynolds' voice was uncharacteristically grim. "Evelyn. Richard's in custody. His wife collapsed—she's at Grandview Medical now. Eleanor Blackwood insists you visit. Says it's... the compassionate thing to do."
###Chapter 489

Evelyn didn't go to Grandview Medical Center to visit Victoria. Instead, she hailed a cab straight to the police station.

The officer at the desk denied her request firmly. "The suspect is still being interrogated. No visitors allowed."

"When can I see him?"

He checked his watch. "At least three or four more hours."

"Three or four hours?" Evelyn sat on the bench. "I'll wait."

The officer gave her a surprised look but said nothing before walking away.

She stayed there from afternoon until the sky darkened.

Around six in the evening, the officer finally returned. "You can see him now."

Evelyn thanked him and followed to the visitation room. Richard Sinclair's eyes widened when he saw her.

"I heard a woman had been waiting all afternoon to see me. Never thought it'd be you."

Then, he scoffed. "Director Carter, what's the rush? Here to gloat?"

When Diana had convinced him to steal Evelyn's designs, he'd known this day would come. He just hadn't expected it so soon.

Before the plagiarism scandal could even gain traction online, Daniel had already thrown him in jail.

"Yes, I'm here to gloat." Evelyn took a slow breath, her gaze sharpening with disdain.

"The Sinclairs were once business owners too. Small-time, but you were still a boss, Mr. Sinclair. Yet you knowingly leaked corporate secrets."

Richard glared coldly. "Who knew you'd dig into my past, Director Carter. Happy now? Almost stole my daughter's husband, then sent her father to prison. Does her misery please you?"

He sneered. "You won't win, Evelyn. Daniel loves my daughter deeply. No matter how pretty you are or what tricks you pull, it's pointless!"

Evelyn inhaled sharply. She leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. "Do you really believe Daniel loves Serena Hart? Or have you forgotten how pitifully she married him? She wanted nothing—defied you just to be with him."

"Yet Daniel gave her nothing in return. When your company collapsed, he never lifted a finger. Serena paid your debts herself—with scholarship money and earnings from secretly selling designs online."

Evelyn smirked as Richard's face paled. "How can you be so sure he loves her?"

Her words snapped something in him. His jaw clenched.

"What do you want? My eldest daughter has suffered enough! We spoiled Diana growing up, neglected Serena. Robbed her of a decent childhood."

"Now her own children barely know her, and Daniel treats her like an afterthought. She's miserable. Will you only be satisfied when she loses everything?"

Evelyn flinched.

This was the first time she'd ever heard Richard express regret for how they'd treated her.

She pressed her lips together, voice icy. "Daniel plans to sue you for corporate espionage. But since you stole my designs, I could drop the charges. You wouldn't go to prison."

Richard's eyes flickered with hope.
###Chapter 490

Daniel Blackwood stared at Evelyn Carter with restless energy. "So, Ms. Carter, will you release me now?"

"Perhaps," Evelyn shut her eyes briefly. "But first, answer two questions for me."

"First." She drew a sharp breath, locking eyes with the silver-haired man across from her. "Before Serena left the country, she told me something shocking. She claimed she wasn't Victoria's biological daughter—that she was your child with another woman. That you sent your real daughter with Victoria to an orphanage and brought Serena home instead. Is this true?"

The air turned thick with silence.

Richard Sinclair's head snapped up, his expression crumbling. His lips parted and closed like a fish out of water before he finally rasped, "Why would she tell you that?"

Evelyn's fingers dug into her palms. "Just answer the question. If Diana learns you abandoned her baby sister, do you think she'd still help you? Knowing how kind-hearted she is?"

All color drained from Richard's face, leaving him ghostly pale against the stark white wall.

After an eternity, he exhaled shakily. "It's... complicated. But yes, I switched the babies."

A knife twisted in Evelyn's chest.

For over twenty years, an outsider's child had stolen a mother's love. And Victoria still didn't know—had collapsed just that afternoon upon learning about her husband's betrayal.

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip. "How could you be so cruel? What did you think of your wife—as just another pawn?"

Richard shrunk into himself, silent for so long the clock's ticking grew deafening. Finally, he muttered, "I'm already going to prison... might as well confess everything."

His eyes lifted, hollow. "Serena isn't mine either. She's the heiress of a foreign tycoon. When I heard they were coming to claim her... I saw an opportunity. I couldn't give my daughter that kind of life—"

"So you traded her like livestock?" Evelyn's voice cracked.

Richard's silence confirmed everything.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. This broken man had once been her hero. Now his pedestal lay in ruins. "Victoria still doesn't know."

"Even if she finds out," Richard whispered, "she'll forgive me. Our real daughter is living like royalty now. All I could do was... love Serena enough to make up for it." He straightened suddenly. "I answered you. What's your second question?"

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "When you claimed to regret how you treated Evelyn Carter... was that guilt? Or just manipulation to win Daniel's protection?"
###Chapter 491

Evelyn's head spun as she stepped out of the police station, but Daniel's words echoed relentlessly in her mind.

"We regret everything. All this time, we assumed Evelyn didn’t need our concern—she always seemed so strong, so self-sufficient."

"We want to make it right. Stealing your designs this time… it was just an attempt to make her happy."

"You once asked why I’d still do it, knowing the risks. Because I’d risk anything for her. If Diana wanted the stars, we’d tear the sky apart to give them to her, after how terribly we failed her before…"

Evelyn lifted her gaze to the night sky. A sharp pang of sorrow twisted inside her chest.

Why had no one—not her parents, not Daniel—ever shown her even a shred of warmth when she was still Evelyn Carter?

Why did their devotion only ignite once she became just Evelyn, and Diana took her place as Evelyn Carter?

Was it simply fate’s cruel joke? Was she never meant to know their love?

"Evelyn."

A deep voice snapped her from her thoughts. She turned toward the sound.

Ethan stood beside a sleek black Maserati, flashing her a quick smile and a wave.

Inside the car, Daniel sat in the backseat, his expression icy, his attention fixed on something in his hands.

Evelyn hesitated before approaching.

"Didn’t expect to see you here."

Ethan grinned, then leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper. "When I called earlier, Mrs. Blackwood was right there—couldn’t say much. Did you visit Mrs. Carter at the hospital?"

She shook her head. "Came straight here."

"Makes sense," Ethan murmured. "She was too upset. The real problem’s here anyway."

He started to say more, but the car door swung open.

Daniel snapped a folder shut on his lap and leveled Evelyn with a frosty stare.

"Get in."

Ethan shot her a wink before slipping into the driver’s seat.

Evelyn exhaled and reached for the passenger door.

Before she could touch the handle, Daniel’s voice cut through the silence.

"Afraid I’ll bite?"

A shiver raced down her spine.

After a beat, she let out a bitter laugh, shut the passenger door, and circled to the back. She slid in beside him, the door clicking shut behind her.

The air inside was thick with tension.

Even without touching him, she felt the chill radiating from Daniel’s rigid posture.

Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore.

"Are you really taking Richard to court?"

Daniel’s gaze flicked to her. "What? Going to call me heartless again?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

Daniel looked away, his voice low and detached.

"I’m the CEO of Pierce Corporation."
###Chapter 492

"If I can't remain professional without letting emotions interfere, how can I expect my team to stay impartial?"

Evelyn chewed her lower lip. She understood Daniel's stance, but this was different...

She turned to face him. "Mr. Blackwood, if I said I don't want Richard Sinclair to serve a long prison sentence, would you consider that unreasonable?"

Daniel lifted his gaze, staring straight ahead. His tone remained neutral as he responded, "Richard Sinclair has two daughters. One was Serena, who nearly killed you and the children multiple times. The other is my wife Diana, who's made your life difficult from the start."

He turned his piercing gaze toward Evelyn, studying her face intently. "Despite all that, you show remarkable tolerance toward Richard and Victoria. You never fight back no matter how harshly they treat you."

"If you hadn't installed those surveillance cameras beforehand, your jewelry design career would be over completely."

Daniel's sharp eyes seemed to see through all her defenses, probing for hidden truths she'd rather keep buried.

Evelyn averted her eyes, unable to meet his penetrating stare. This man remained as dangerously perceptive as ever.

Nothing escaped his notice - not even her smallest actions.

The car's interior grew uncomfortably silent.

Daniel reclined gracefully against the leather seat, observing Evelyn's profile. "Give me one good reason to release Richard Sinclair."

Evelyn's breath caught.

A reason...

Would the truth about being Richard's biological daughter suffice? Or that Richard and Victoria had genuinely changed? Did those count as valid reasons?

She had countless explanations, yet couldn't voice a single one to Daniel.

After a prolonged silence, Evelyn wiped her nose and gazed at the passing nightscape. "I believe parents deserve forgiveness when they make mistakes out of love for their children."

She turned back to Daniel with a faint smile. "Maybe it's because I've been Liam and Sophia's adoptive mother for six years that I understand parental instincts. If Sophia faced similar circumstances when she's older, I might do the same. Is that reason enough for you?"

Daniel narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing her with that intense dark gaze.

Finally, he gave a humorless smile. "Not entirely convincing, but it's a start."

He closed his eyes wearily, massaging his temples. "Only today's meeting attendees know about the plagiarism incident. Since no financial damages occurred, I could order everyone to stay silent and pretend nothing happened. But..."

His voice dropped lower. "Someone leaked footage from your design department meeting online. It's gone viral within hours."

Evelyn's body went rigid.

She'd spent all afternoon waiting at the police station to see Richard. How could she have known...

Snapping back to reality, she immediately reached for her phone.

Before she could search, Daniel stated flatly, "They only posted your design presentation - not the full meeting."

He opened his eyes to glance at her. "Unless we handle this properly, you'll be branded a plagiarist forever. Your jewelry design career would be over."

"To clear your name, we must expose everything Richard did. He'll have to face prison time regardless."
###Chapter 493

Evelyn shut her eyes tightly.

She had every reason to believe Diana was behind the leaked video.

This was a deliberate move—Diana was forcing her into an impossible choice.

Her career, built over years of relentless effort, was everything to her.

Yet her adoptive parents, who had raised her for two decades, were just as irreplaceable.

Both mattered. Both were tearing her apart.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists, nails biting into her palms. She’d been foolish. Too absorbed in work these past weeks, she’d forgotten about the ticking bomb beside her—Diana.

The car rolled to a stop.

Daniel’s voice cut through the silence. "We’re here."

Evelyn blinked, disoriented, then realized they’d arrived at Lakeside Residences.

"Thanks," she muttered, stepping out.

"Evelyn."

She paused at the sound of her name, turning back. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

Daniel lounged against the leather seat, his gaze steady. "No dinner invitation?"

Her jaw tightened.

Dinner was just an excuse. Once inside, alone, who knew what he’d expect?

Even if she needed his child to save Oliver, tonight wasn’t the night.

After a beat, she exhaled sharply. "If today hadn’t happened, I’d gladly celebrate with you. But now?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "With the Blackwood Group’s lead designer accused of plagiarism and stocks crashing, I doubt you’re in the mood either."

Daniel’s lips quirked. "Didn’t realize you tracked our stock prices."

"Occupational hazard," she lied.

Truthfully, she’d only noticed the plummeting stocks while searching for news about the scandal.

Daniel stroked his chin. "The stocks? Not a concern. You’ll fix it."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Flattering. But if I can’t clear my name and never design again, good luck with that."

She turned on her heel and walked away.

Daniel watched her retreating figure until she vanished into the building. His expression darkened.

Ethan, his driver, hesitated. "Sir… if this isn’t resolved, will she really never design again?"

He knew Evelyn’s secret—the renowned Europa jeweler, Celeste. Her pieces sold for millions.

Could a scandal this small end that?

Daniel leaned back, eyes closing.

Evelyn was brilliant. When Joseph framed her, even Diana had pushed for his arrest.

Yet Evelyn had refused.

"I’ll handle it."

He opened his eyes abruptly. "You’re engaged, right?"

Ethan blinked. "Uh, yes. Three months to go." Then, confused: "But weren’t we talking about Evelyn?"
###Chapter 494

Daniel's eyes darkened as he sat in the back seat. "Don't you think you've overstepped with Evelyn?"

Ethan froze. Overstepped? Had he?

Seeing his confusion, Daniel turned to stare out the window.

"Your constant attention toward her. And just now at the police station—whispering so close to her ear."

Ethan blinked.

His mind raced. Then it clicked.

Was his boss…jealous?

Clearing his throat, Ethan nodded. "Understood. I'll be more mindful in the future."

Daniel gave a curt response before glancing up at the apartment building.

The lights in Evelyn's unit were on.

"Let's go."

Evelyn stepped out of the elevator, keys in hand, when she noticed light spilling from beneath her door.

She frowned.

Someone was inside. Grace? She had given her a spare key when she first moved in.

The scandal had exploded online that morning. Grace must have seen it and come to check on her.

The thought warmed her. Smiling, she unlocked the door.

"Mommy!"

"Mommy!"

Two small bodies crashed into her legs the second she entered.

Liam and Emily clung to her, their bright eyes gazing up.

Emily blinked sleepily. "You're so late! I almost fell asleep waiting."

Liam grinned. "Mommy, we helped Godmother cook! It's all for you!"

Evelyn stood frozen, stunned by the unexpected joy.

Then she scooped Emily into her arms and grabbed Liam's hand. "What are you doing here?"

"Like we'd stay away after what happened?" Grace called from the kitchen while Benjamin set the table. "Benjamin showed me the video this afternoon. The second I saw it, I knew someone was trying to ruin you. As if you'd ever steal someone else's work!"

Grace turned off the stove, wiping her hands on her apron before stepping into view.

"Was it Diana again?"

Evelyn hesitated, glancing at Benjamin.

Grace caught the look and immediately pulled her into the bedroom. "Benjamin, feed the kids first. Evelyn and I need to talk."

Once the door shut, Evelyn collapsed onto the bed with a sigh. "This time, it was my father."

Grace's jaw dropped. "Your father?"

Evelyn stared at the ceiling, bitter amusement twisting her lips. "After all these years, they finally realize they treated me horribly. But now, in their eyes, Diana is their daughter."

Grace was speechless. "So they helped her attack you?"

Evelyn nodded, eyes closing.

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, Evelyn opened her eyes. "Why bring Liam and Emily?"

As far as she knew, since returning to Silvercrest Manor, the twins had been under Gregory's tight security. She rarely got to see them.

Grace bit her lip. "Daniel arranged it. He reached out, said you'd be upset after everything. Thought surprising you with them might help."

Then she frowned. "He mentioned picking you up. Why didn't he come back with you?"

Evelyn paused.

The memory of Daniel asking to come upstairs resurfaced.

Had he known Grace and the kids were here?

She'd assumed he wanted…something else entirely.
###Chapter 495

Evelyn didn't catch the shift in Grace's expression. She moved to pour herself water, taking a sip before commenting, "Honestly, Daniel can be so hard to figure out sometimes. The moment that video went viral online, Blackwood Corporation immediately issued a statement calling it misleading."

"Not long after, Daniel reached out to me about the situation. Said you must be upset and asked me to cheer you up." Grace scoffed, shaking her head. "If I didn't know he was the bastard who hurt you so badly, I might've mistaken him for a decent man."

Evelyn's fingers curled into tight fists.

Abruptly, she stood and hurried to the balcony.

The spot where the Maserati had parked earlier was now empty. Evelyn smacked her forehead in frustration.

Daniel must think she's insane. He went through all that trouble to surprise her, and she didn't even invite him upstairs.

The night air bit sharply against her skin.

Shivering in the cold breeze, Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed Daniel.

"Calling to thank me?" His voice came through the moment the call connected, amusement lacing his tone.

Evelyn hesitated before releasing a quiet sigh. "Why didn't you tell me? I thought—"

"You thought I was plotting something?" Daniel chuckled. "Surprised you'd consider that after everything."

His words burned her cheeks like a slap.

She sniffed, eager to change the subject. "We haven't eaten yet. Want to join?"

Silence stretched before Daniel's low laugh crackled through. "I gave you the chance to invite me up earlier. You didn't take it."

"I'm heading to see Victoria now. Diana's waiting at Grandview Medical Center."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Okay."

Just before ending the call, she inhaled deeply. "Thank you."

Regardless of everything, Daniel had defied his family to let Liam and Sophia visit. That counted for something.

"Things will get better," Daniel murmured so softly Evelyn almost missed it.

She pressed the phone closer. "What?"

"Nothing." His tone turned icy before the line went dead.

Frowning, Evelyn hung up.

Returning to the dining table, she found Liam and Sophia already halfway through their meals.

Their faces lit up when they saw her. "Mommy, come eat! Aunt Grace's food is amazing!"

Benjamin and Grace smiled at her from across the table. "Come sit."

Evelyn took her seat, studying the faces around her—her closest friends and the children she adored most.

Maybe she shouldn't feel so miserable after all.

With that thought, Evelyn drew a steadying breath, picked up her fork, and took a large bite.

Though Theodore had prepared an elaborate lunch earlier, she'd barely touched it.

This meal, here with her loved ones, felt like her first real one in ages.

Liam and Sophia exchanged glances, grinning when they saw Evelyn eating properly.

After dinner, when Evelyn moved to clear the table, Grace and Benjamin stopped her.
###Chapter 496

Grace shoved Evelyn into the bedroom. "Don't lift a finger. Don't overthink. Just sleep."

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest—she could at least help with the dishes—but Benjamin swiftly wrapped an arm around Grace's waist. "We want some alone time," he said with a wink. "Doing dishes together is our version of romance. No third wheels allowed."

Before Evelyn could react, Benjamin whisked Grace away.

Only when their laughter faded down the hallway did Liam speak up. "Stop staring, Mommy."

Evelyn blinked, suddenly aware she'd been watching the empty doorway. She looked down to find Liam and Sophia already in their pajamas, clutching their pillows by the bedroom door. "We're sleeping with you tonight," Sophia announced around a yawn.

"It's been forever since we had a sleepover," Liam added, his smile knowing. "You've been too busy for us lately. Tonight you're making up for it."

Evelyn's throat tightened. She reached out to tweak Liam's nose. "You little schemers."

Scooping Sophia into her arms, she carried them both to bed. The three of them squeezed onto the mattress, staring at the ceiling shadows.

"Mommy?" Liam's voice was soft in the darkness. "Do you really not want Grandpa to go to jail?"

Evelyn's fingers clenched the sheets. The silence stretched before she finally whispered, "He's still my father."

"Daniel is our daddy," Liam countered. "You always tell us to be tough because he hurt us. But when Grandpa—who's always hurt you—needs help, you go soft." His small sigh filled the room. "That's not fair."

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. He was right. She demanded her children cut ties with Daniel, yet couldn't follow her own advice with her parents.

"This is the last time," she vowed.

Sophia poked her arm. "But last time with Grandma and Aunt Serena, you said that too."

Evelyn rubbed her temples. Her children never forgot anything. "That was about helping Grandma. This is Grandpa. It's different."

It had to be the last time. If Richard and Victoria crossed the line again, she wouldn't intervene.

"Promise?" Oliver's voice chimed from the necklace on the nightstand.

Evelyn started—she'd forgotten he was listening. She touched the pendant. "I promise."

"Good," Oliver said simply. "Sleep now. Tomorrow everything will be fixed."

The finality in his tone sent a shiver down Evelyn's spine as she pulled the covers over her children. Whatever Oliver had planned, dawn would bring the reckoning.
###Chapter 497

That night, Evelyn slept more peacefully than she had in months.

Liam curled up on her left side while Emily snuggled close on her right. Oliver's soft breathing hummed from the pendant resting on the nightstand.

For the first time in forever, all three of her most precious people surrounded her.

She pulled Liam and Emily tighter against her, and just like that, the weight crushing her chest didn’t feel so unbearable anymore.

As long as they were with her, she could face anything.

The next morning, Grace’s frantic knocking shattered the quiet.

"Evelyn! Wake up! You need to see this!"

Groggy, Evelyn rubbed her temples and shuffled to the door.

"Keep it down," she whispered. "They're still asleep."

Grace peeked past her, wincing when she saw the kids hadn’t stirred.

Evelyn shut the door and dragged Grace to the couch. "What’s so urgent?"

"Look!" Grace thrust a newspaper into her hands.

The headline screamed in bold letters: Marcus Sterling Issues Public Apology.

Evelyn’s breath caught. She snatched the paper, scanning the article with widening eyes.

It was a full-page confession from Marcus himself.

The prodigy designer admitted his obsession with Evelyn had driven him to deceive her. He detailed how she’d mentored him, answering his calls even during work hours—how he’d glimpsed her unreleased designs during those video sessions and stolen them.

He’d uploaded them first, knowing exactly what he was doing.

Now, with the truth exposed, he claimed remorse. He couldn’t let his actions tarnish her reputation or Blackwood Enterprises.

Evelyn read it twice, fingers trembling.

This changed everything.

Grace gripped her wrist. "This is huge! You’re cleared!"

Evelyn’s pulse raced. Marcus hadn’t just confessed to theft—he’d carefully omitted any mention of Richard’s corporate espionage.

Someone had orchestrated this perfectly.

"Was it Daniel?" Grace asked.

Evelyn shook her head. "I don’t know."

"Mommy." Liam padded out of the bedroom, yawning. He shot her a knowing grin. "Toldja Oliver could handle it."

Grace’s jaw dropped. "Oliver did this?!"

A smug chuckle crackled from the pendant in Liam’s hand. "Marcus has skeletons. Once I found them, he folded like cheap origami."
###Chapter 498

Evelyn's jaw dropped.

Grace massaged her temples with a weary sigh. "I never imagined this mess would clean up so effortlessly."

She'd braced herself for days of strategizing. Yet the entire situation had flipped before dawn.

Oliver's lips curved slightly. "Told you to get some rest. Wake up, problem solved. Was I wrong?"

A soft chuckle escaped Evelyn. Then she exhaled sharply. "But how did you make Marcus Sterling cooperate?"

"Simple." His laugh carried through the phone. "I breached his system. Emptied his hard drive - childhood bedwetting diaries, failed crushes, the works. And..."

"Stolen design drafts from other artists."

Evelyn froze. "So his so-called talent..."

"Fabricated," Oliver confirmed. "Just an enthusiast with no real skill. All his 'original' pieces were bought from actual designers."

Her fingers pressed harder against her forehead.

This revelation stunned her.

"But," Oliver's voice turned serious after a pause, "when I confronted Marcus last night, I only made him admit to stealing your designs, Mom. Clearing Grandpa Richard's name wasn't part of our deal."

"Given Marcus's personality, he'd never voluntarily take responsibility."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "You're suggesting..."

"Someone else got to him after I did. Forced him to shoulder full blame." Oliver's tone turned decisive. "My money's on Daniel Blackwood."

Evelyn's pulse spiked.

Daniel.

Why would he help clear Richard Sinclair's name? For Diana? Or... for her? The motives tangled in her mind.

After ending the call, Evelyn paced her apartment, fingers tightening around her phone. Finally, she stepped onto the balcony and dialed Daniel's number.

The line rang endlessly. When it connected, Ethan's exhausted voice answered instead.

"Evelyn." He sounded drained. "We're boarding now."

Her brow furrowed. "Where?"

"Not where." A weary sigh. "After dropping you at Lakeside last night, we flew straight to Marcus's location. Spent the entire night strong-arming him into confession. Mr. Blackwood hasn't slept."

Her throat constricted.

"Thank you," she managed.

Ethan hesitated. "There's more. That hacker your son encountered last night? It wasn't Marcus." A pause. "It was Daniel himself."
###Chapter 499

Evelyn's grip on her phone tightened instantly. "Mr. Blackwood, he—"

"He knows hacking too."

On the other end of the line, Ethan sounded slightly baffled. "Realistically, with how packed his schedule is, Mr. Blackwood shouldn’t have time for hobbies. But he’s scarily good at it. Said he picked it up years ago out of boredom."

Ethan added, admiration clear in his voice, "Honestly, Mr. Blackwood might be the most brilliant man I’ve ever met. Hacking isn’t easy, yet he mastered it just to kill time. Unbelievable."

Evelyn’s fingers trembled slightly.

A memory surfaced—back when she had just married Daniel, she’d once told him how much she admired men who could hack.

She had even asked him, naive and hopeful, if he knew how to do it.

Daniel had given her a cold, dismissive look.

"Hackers are just glorified programmers. Why not idolize them instead?"

After that, she never brought it up again.

When Oliver was born and showed an uncanny talent for computers, his teachers raved about his potential.

Evelyn had thought it was fate’s kindness—a son gifted with the very skill she admired, as if making up for the hardships she’d endured.

Now, Ethan’s words shattered that illusion.

Oliver’s talent hadn’t come from nowhere.

It was inherited.

Daniel hadn’t been clueless about hacking. Far from it. A skill he’d casually learned surpassed Oliver’s, despite all the training she’d poured into him.

But back then, when she’d confessed her admiration, he’d shut her down without a second thought.

Was that how it worked? If a man didn’t love you, he wouldn’t bother showing you even the smallest part of himself?

"Evelyn?" Ethan’s voice pulled her back. The silence had stretched too long.

"I’m here."

"The plane’s about to take off." He exhaled sharply. "We’ll land in Willowbrook in five hours. We need to get to the bottom of that leaked video. Yesterday’s meeting was confidential. Whoever recorded and posted it has guts. We find them, or this won’t end well."

Evelyn’s brows knitted together. "You’re right." If they didn’t act now, there’d be another leak. And next time, it could be her designs—still under wraps within the company.

"Have your assistant compile a list of everyone at that meeting. Use these five hours to narrow down suspects."

Then, the call ended.

Evelyn stood on the balcony, phone clutched tight, watching the city pulse below.

She already had a suspect in mind.

But would Daniel actually take action against them?

After a long pause, she dialed Oliver.

"I didn’t mess up." The moment she mentioned it was Daniel last night, Oliver’s voice crackled with excitement. "So it was him? No wonder the firewall was insane. I thought he’d hired some elite programmer."

Then, almost grudgingly, he admitted, "But if it was really him… he went easy on me."

Oliver had faced Daniel before. His skills were leagues ahead. Last night’s hack into Marcus’s system had resistance, but nothing unmanageable.

Evelyn went still.
###Chapter 500

"Is he...good at hacking?"

"Exceptionally." Oliver Carter pressed his lips together. "It might take me years to match his level."

Evelyn Carter's heart plummeted at his words.

She forced herself to chat casually with Oliver a little longer before ending the call and returning to the living room.

Grace Thornton had prepared breakfast. She waved Evelyn over, though her brows furrowed as she studied her. "Marcus Sterling confessed to stealing your designs. That's good news. So why do you look like you've lost a battle?"

Evelyn forced a smile. She lowered her head and focused on eating without another word.

Five hours later, at Blackwood Group Tower.

The same conference room. The same faces. Another meeting.

Seated at the head of the table, Daniel Blackwood couldn't hide the exhaustion etched into his features.

Yet, his presence remained as commanding as ever—cold, untouchable.

With a faint smirk, he tapped his fingers rhythmically against the polished table. "By now, you've all seen the morning news. The plagiarism scandal never existed. Marcus Sterling acted alone. Mr. Sinclair had nothing to do with it."

In the corner, Audrey Sinclair scoffed under her breath. "How convenient. Suddenly, he's innocent? Didn't Director Evelyn have proof?"

Evelyn turned, meeting Audrey's glare with a calm smile. "Perhaps Mr. Sinclair simply admired my designs. Maybe he took photos to appreciate them privately. While inappropriate, accusing him of leaking confidential information seems... excessive."

Audrey's lips pressed into a thin line. She wanted to argue but found no words.

Her fists clenched. "If that's true, then your designs were stolen during your video call with Marcus. That means you're responsible too. You also leaked company secrets!"

Evelyn shrugged. "I accept that."

"As punishment, Evelyn's bonuses and commissions for this project will be revoked."

Daniel's voice cut through the tension, cool and final. "Any objections?"

Evelyn was the first to respond. "None."

Audrey gritted her teeth, seething in silence.

Beside her, Diana Hart let out a soft, mocking laugh. "Such a noble sacrifice, Ms. Carter." Her gaze flickered with barely concealed derision.

Evelyn knew exactly what Diana meant—she was mocking her for protecting Richard Sinclair. Diana knew the truth better than anyone.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, returning Diana's smirk with an icy stare. "The plagiarism matter is settled."

At the head of the table, Daniel rubbed his temples. "Now, we address yesterday's video leak."

Ethan Reynolds placed a file in front of him.

Daniel slammed it onto the table. "Our investigation traced the upload to a computer in the design department. Computer fifty-two. Who uses it?"

Silence.

Then, Cassandra Montgomery hesitantly stood. "Actually... for the past two weeks, that computer has been assigned to..."

Her eyes darted to Diana.

"Mrs. Blackwood."
