###Chapter 1: The Last Chance

"Miss Valentine, I'm afraid this attempt was unsuccessful again."

The doctor's words cut through Stella's heart like a dull blade.

Her fingers turned white as she clenched the test results.

"Can I try one more time?"

The doctor removed his glasses and rubbed his temples wearily. "Your ovarian function has severely declined. More ovulation induction shots will only accelerate the cancer's spread."

"I don't care."

"Miss Valentine, your current physical condition makes pregnancy impossible!"

Stella lifted her head, her gaze defiant. "I have to try again."

The doctor studied her hollow cheeks and dark under-eye circles before sighing. "The injection room is on the second floor. You have 24 hours for optimal conception."

......

The mansion was eerily silent.

Stella watched the wall clock, each tick of the second hand sounding like a countdown.

She dialed the memorized number.

"Adrian, we need to talk."

A cold male voice responded, "What game are you playing now, Stella?"

"I'll agree to the divorce."

The line went quiet for several seconds.

"Terms?" His question was clipped.

"Come home tonight." Her voice was barely audible. "Just this once."

Adrian scoffed. "You'd stoop this low just to end our marriage?"

"Think whatever you want." Stella tightened her grip on the phone. "Miss tonight, and you'll never marry Lily Savigny."

After hanging up, she stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Moonlight spilled across her bony shoulders.

Stella... What a cruel name.

She once believed she was the brightest star in Adrian's life. Now she'd become the burden he desperately wanted to discard.

The bedroom door burst open.

Adrian stormed in, his piercing gaze sharp as winter frost. "You'd better keep your word, Stella."

She turned with a pale smile. "When have I ever lied to you?"

In the next instant, he threw her onto the bed.

Gripping her chin, he hissed, "Remember your promise."

Stella closed her eyes, whispering silently: Hold on, baby. Mommy will save you...
###Chapter 2: A Full Night Counts

He moved with brutal force, as if unleashing years of pent-up hatred. The only sounds in the room were ragged breaths and the creaking of the bed.

Stella Valentine bit her lip until it bled. Tears mixed with blood trailed down her chin. Her fingers clutched the sheets so tightly her knuckles turned white.

When it ended, she collapsed onto the mattress, trembling violently.

"Had enough?" Adrian Roland's voice was glacial.

A coughing fit wracked her body, the metallic taste of blood flooding her mouth.

"Sign the papers and get out."

Stella pushed herself up weakly. "How much did you drink?"

"None of your business."

"Your stomach—"

"I needed to be drunk to touch you." His laugh was cruel. "The thought of it makes me sick."

She wiped blood from her lips, her voice feather-light. "No traffic on the way here?"

Adrian lit a cigarette by the window, the flame illuminating his sharp jawline. "Divorce waits for no one."

"So eager to be rid of me?"

Smoke drifted toward her, triggering another coughing spell. Her thin shoulders shook uncontrollably.

"You know exactly how eager." He blew a smoke ring directly at her, watching with satisfaction as she curled into herself. "Nine a.m. tomorrow at the courthouse."

"It's not over yet." She lifted her gaze. "I said a full night."

Adrian crushed his cigarette violently. "Have you no shame, Stella?"

Memories flickered through her mind like an old film reel.

She couldn't remember when Adrian hadn't been the center of her world. Their families were close—they'd grown up together.

Young Adrian would bring her star-shaped candies, secretly throw away love letters she received, spend months folding jars full of paper stars.

"These are fake. I want real stars," she'd once pouted.

"Then I'll pluck them for you," the boy had laughed, tweaking her nose.

"Liar! Stars are in the sky."

"When you marry me, I'll bring you the whole galaxy."

Staring at the bloodstained sheets, Stella suddenly smiled. Fate's cruelest joke was taking what she loved most and grinding it to dust before her eyes.
###Chapter 3: The Blood-Stained Truth

The tragedy five years ago struck too suddenly, leaving Stella Valentine no time to react.

On the eve of their wedding, Adrian Roland's parents died in a horrific highway accident. The surveillance footage clearly showed her father behind the wheel.

Within three days, her mother Grace Laurent and uncle Victor Lefèvre seized control of the Roland family's entire fortune. Two century-old dynasties merged in the cruelest way possible—with her uncle emerging as the ultimate victor.

The timing was too perfect, too orchestrated to be mere coincidence.

She would never forget that day. Adrian shattered every star-filled jar they had folded together. Glass shards cut his hands, staining the colorful paper stars with blood.

"Get out, Stella!" His voice was raw, his eyes bloodshot. "I never want to see you again."

She was only twenty, already carrying his child. Too terrified to tell him, she fled abroad to give birth alone.

Fate mocked her again. The baby was rushed to intensive care after birth, forcing her to return and seek Adrian's help—only to find Lily Savigny nestled in his arms.

They said Lily stayed by his side through his darkest days.
They said Lily became his only light.
They said Lily helped him rebuild his empire from scratch in just two years.

The cruelest irony? She remained his legal wife. For four years, he'd tried every method to force her to sign the divorce papers.

She kept believing time would prove her innocence—that he'd come back once his anger faded. Until the doctor handed her the lung cancer diagnosis.

A coughing fit tore through her. Blood trickled from her lips, blooming like crimson plum blossoms on the white sheets.

"What's wrong with you?" Adrian frowned.

She gathered her courage. "Adrian, I'm sick—"

"Dying?" His laugh was icy. "I'll set off fireworks to celebrate. Your death clears the way for Lily."

Words died in her throat. She pressed a hand over the bloodstain, but he yanked the sheets away.

"Blood?" His smirk was cruel. "Did you even get surgery to fake virginity for tonight?"

Agony consumed her. Curled into herself, she couldn't speak. All those paper stars they'd folded had turned to glass shards—piercing straight through her heart.
###Chapter 4: The Last Wish

A bitter smile tugged at Stella Valentine's lips.

Moonlight streamed through the gap in the curtains, elongating her frail shadow across the floor.

Illness had whittled her down to mere bones, leaving even her shadow faint and insubstantial.

"Where were you today?" Adrian Roland's voice was glacial.

She lifted her gaze to meet his. "Do you care?"

"Damian came to discuss the divorce papers. You weren't here."

"I was at the hospital."

"For what?"

"A hymen repair," she said with a hollow laugh. "You already knew, didn't you?"

His eyes darkened instantly. "Stella, I'll never understand you... Everything in the Roland family was yours after marriage. Why kill my parents? They treated you like their own daughter. Was there anything I wouldn't have given you?"

"What if I told you I knew nothing about it?"

A cold sneer twisted his lips. "Both parents dead, left with nothing, I nearly drank myself to death in the gutters. And what did your family do? Seized the Roland assets while you vanished without a trace... How could I possibly believe you?"

"Adrian..."

"If Lily hadn't appeared, I'd have been finished." His expression softened momentarily. "She's intelligent, kind... she understands me."

"She loves you?"

"Of course."

Stella nodded faintly. "Good."

At least after she was gone, someone would truly love him.

The wall clock chimed midnight.

"I promise," she said, meeting his eyes, "I'll sign the papers after tonight."

Adrian studied her with a frown.

She stepped closer, rising on her toes to brush her lips against his. "Consider this... my last dream."
###Chapter 5: When Pain Numbed the Soul

Morning light stabbed through the curtains, and Stella Valentine realized she was still alive.

She opened her eyes slowly, every bone in her body aching as if disassembled and reassembled.

Her skin burned with pain, but her heart felt terrifyingly hollow.

Last night had been less like lovemaking and more like torture. Adrian Roland hadn't even granted her a kiss—just mechanically fulfilled his marital duty.

The sheets beside her were cold. She traced the wrinkled fabric, still faintly scented with his cologne.

A silk tie lay abandoned on the floor, its navy blue sheen icy under the light. Her fingers trembled as she picked it up.

"Don't be afraid, sweetheart..." She folded the tie carefully and tucked it into her purse. The smiling face in the photograph made her eyes sting.

Tears splashed onto the picture. She frantically wiped them away with her sleeve, terrified of smudging her daughter's smile.

"Mommy promises, this time will work."

The documents on the desk waited silently. The bold letters "Divorce Agreement" burned her vision.

The final clause glared at her: Permanent departure from Houston.

Stella laughed softly. She wasn't just leaving Houston—she'd soon leave this world entirely.

The pen scratched across paper. When she finished signing, relief washed over her like a tide.

Hospital antiseptic assaulted her senses.

"Miss Valentine..." The doctor hesitated, eyeing the bruises on her neck. "Do you need legal assistance?"

"No." She adjusted her collar. "How soon can we test for pregnancy?"

"At least seven days." He adjusted his glasses. "But if unsuccessful, chemotherapy must begin immediately."

"And without treatment?"

"Six months, maximum." The doctor sighed. "Chemo could extend it to three to five years—"

"I need nine months." Her voice cut through his words. "Money isn't an issue."

The examination room turned deathly quiet. The doctor studied her for a long moment. "Cancer pain is worse than death itself."

"I'll endure it."

"It's beyond ordinary human tolerance."

Stella smiled suddenly, backlit by sunlight that gilded her frail silhouette.

"You're mistaken, Doctor." Her whisper barely stirred the air. "At the worst pain...you stop feeling anything at all."

Just like now. Her heart had long gone numb.
###Chapter 6: Starlight and Lies

The sunlight stung her eyes.

Stella Valentine raised her hand to shield herself from the blinding glare, squinting up at the sky. The sun hung high, its golden rays gilding the world below. It reminded her of a childhood fairy tale—where the sun was a proud princess, and the stars merely humble handmaidens.

The sudden ringing of her phone shattered the moment.

The name flashing on the screen made her fingers tremble.

"Adrian?"

"Did you sign it?" His voice was ice.

Her grip tightened on the phone, knuckles whitening. "I did."

"Then give it to Damian."

"Not yet."

A cold laugh crackled through the line. "What game are you playing now, Stella?"

"I'm not—"

"Last night—that was your doing, wasn't it?" Disgust dripped from Adrian's words. "You'd stoop that low just to get me to touch you?"

She closed her eyes, lashes fluttering.

The boy she remembered would never speak to her like this. The one who'd tied her shoelaces, who'd shielded her from the wind—he'd never wielded cruelty like a blade.

"Adrian," she whispered, "did you see the stars last night?"

"I don't have time for this!"

"They were beautiful..."

"Stella!"

"I mailed the divorce papers," her voice was feather-light. "You'll get them in seven days."

A harsh breath hissed through the receiver.

"Liar!" Adrian snarled. "Just like five years ago—you never change!"

"I never lied to you."

"Then why delay signing?"

She gazed at the sky, a single tear tracing her cheek. "Because I wanted to see the stars... one last time. With you."

The only answer was the hollow click of the call ending.

Stella slowly lowered her phone.

The sunlight still blazed, but its warmth couldn't reach her. Her heart was already fractured—like a shattered night sky.
###Chapter 7: The Truth Revealed

A child's innocent singing drifted from the hospital entrance.

"Twinkle, twinkle, little star..."

A little boy sat alone on the steps, swinging his short legs.

Stella Valentine crouched beside him. "Sweetheart, why are you out here by yourself?"

"Waiting for Mommy." He lifted his face. "She's cleaning inside."

"Why not wait indoors?"

The boy lowered his head. "Mommy says her job is dirty. She doesn’t want me to see."

Stella's heart ached.

She pulled out all the cash from her bag. "Give this to your mother."

The thick stack of bills made the boy's eyes widen. "Really?"

"Consider it payment for your lovely song."

The boy immediately straightened his back and sang "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" with earnest focus.

His clear voice was like sunlight piercing through the shadows in her heart.

On her way home, Stella kept replaying that pure child's melody in her mind.

Money was a double-edged sword.

Some killed for it. Others used it to save lives.

A woman in a pink dress stood waiting at the villa's gate.

"Miss Valentine, I'm Lily Savigny."

Stella narrowed her eyes. "What do you want?"

"To deliver an invitation." Lily held out a crimson wedding card. "Adrian and I are getting married."

Stella scoffed. "Aren't you afraid I'll crash your party?"

"You wouldn't dare." Lily stepped closer. "Unless you want your son to die."

Stella froze. "How do you know—"

"My mother delivered him, of course." Lily smiled sweetly. "That poor child, born with septicemia..."

"It was you!"

"Correct." Lily shoved the invitation into her hand. "I also arranged that car accident five years ago."

Stella felt as if struck by lightning. "Three lives..."

"They were in my way." Lily patted her cheek. "Since you're dying anyway, I thought you should know the truth."

A piercing scream tore through the night.
###Chapter 8: The Seven-Day Promise

Stella Valentine's fingers tightened abruptly, pinning Lily Savigny against the cold wall. Her nails dug into Lily's neck, leaving angry red marks.

Lily's eyes widened in terror, her legs kicking uselessly in the air. "Have you lost your mind?! Adrian will be here any second!"

"Perfect." A cold smile curled Stella's lips. "Let him witness your last moments."

"Your son is still in my custody!"

"Then we'll descend into hell together." Stella's whisper was feather-light yet sent violent tremors through Lily's body.

Hurried footsteps echoed from the corridor's end.

As Adrian Roland turned the corner, Stella deliberately increased the pressure. Lily's face turned from red to ashen, her eyes rolling back.

"Stop!"

A brutal force flung Stella backward. Her spine collided with the hallway railing, sending searing pain radiating through her body.

Adrian cradled Lily protectively, his gaze at Stella filled with revulsion. "Tired of living?"

Stella gripped the railing to steady herself, rusted metal slicing her palm. Blood dripped from her fingertips.

"Yes. I'm tired of living." Her voice was barely audible. "That's why I fear nothing now."

Lily coughed violently in Adrian's arms, flashing Stella a triumphant smirk.

The absurdity struck Stella. Such clumsy theatrics, yet someone still bought the performance.

"We're filing for divorce. Now." Adrian's tone was glacial.

"Seven days." Stella raised her bloodied hand. "Not a day less."

"What gives you the right to threaten me?"

"Lily's secrets." Stella took two measured steps forward. "Shall I share them with the press? Would your wedding still proceed as planned?"

Adrian's pupils constricted.

"Relax. I only want seven nights." Stella's voice softened unexpectedly. "Watch the stars with me. Like... before."

Lily clutched Adrian's sleeve. "Don't listen to her!"

Stella chuckled. "Or should I call the Financial Weekly reporter now? They'd adore an exclusive about your fiancée."

Adrian's knuckles cracked under the strain of his clenched fist. Finally, he relented. "Seven days."

"Eight p.m. Our old spot." Stella turned toward the staircase, waving her crimson-stained hand without looking back. "Bring the telescope. Orion will be spectacular tonight."

Her footsteps faded as Lily's hysterical sobs erupted behind her.

Stella pulled out her phone. Tears splashed onto the screen as Ethan's photo appeared.

"Mommy's coming for you soon," she whispered.
###Chapter 9: The Madness Within

Adrian Roland's brows furrowed into a tight knot, his gaze sharp as a blade slicing through her.

Stella Valentine saw everything with crystal clarity.

How could he possibly agree?

His beloved woman was injured, and the perpetrator stood right before him. Adrian probably wished he could tear her to pieces—why would he ever watch stars with her?

The irony was, in her current physical state, even standing steady took tremendous effort. If Lily Savigny hadn't staged this act, Stella wouldn't have been able to lay a finger on her.

Her eyes drifted to Lily's dress.

A white-and-pink chiffon gown embroidered with delicate lavender flowers—exquisitely blinding.

Adrian had always loved that pattern. Once, eight out of ten dresses in her closet were floral sundresses he'd personally picked.

Now that dress remained pristine, without a single crease.

Yet its owner wept as if the world had wronged her.

"Miss Savigny," Stella suddenly spoke, "what do you do for a living?"

Lily trembled like a startled rabbit, burrowing into Adrian's arms. "Adrian..."

"Don't be afraid." His voice softened to a whisper as he tightened his grip around her waist. "I'm here."

When he turned to Stella, that warmth froze instantly. "Why do you ask?"

"Just curious."

"Stella Valentine, I'm warning you—don't even think about touching Lily."

"Adrian Roland, I'm warning you too." A sudden smile curved her lips. "When I lose control, even I fear myself."

His face darkened, but he swallowed his fury.

Stella nearly laughed aloud.

Everyone had a weakness.

Hers was her son. Adrian's was Lily. If he already saw her as a villain, what harm was there in being crueler?

She strode past them, pushing the door open. "Seven tonight. The rooftop."

The floor-to-ceiling windows of their marital home faced the garden.

When she glanced down again, the perfect couple had vanished.

Probably rushing to the hospital.

He must be heartbroken.

That was Adrian—always doting on those he loved. Pity the Stella he once cherished had long been replaced by Lily.

It didn't matter anymore.

All she wanted now was to conceive and let her baby live.

Stella took out her phone, set up the stand, and pressed record.

"Sweetheart, it's Mommy." She smiled tenderly at the lens. "If you're watching this, I'm already gone. But don't be sad. Mommy just went somewhere beautiful."

Her gaze softened like spring water.

"I thought long and hard, and decided to name you Ethan. Like the sun—warm, bright, and forever happy. Okay?"

"When you miss me, look up at the stars. I'll be there, watching over you every night—"

Her voice broke.

Tears cascaded down.

She hurriedly ended the recording. Her child mustn't see her cry.

After saving the video to a flash drive, she headed downstairs to mail it. That tiny metal piece carried all her love and longing.
###Chapter 10 Stella, You Deserve to Die

At exactly seven o'clock, Adrian pushed open the front door.

"You're here."

Stella sat at the vanity, having spent three hours meticulously applying makeup to conceal her pallid complexion.

A storm brewed in Adrian's eyes. "Stella, you deserve to die."

Her heart skipped a beat. "What?"

"Lily had a miscarriage."

Stella froze for a second before letting out a cold laugh. "You think it's because I hit her today?"

"Obviously," Adrian's voice was icy. "Take it out on me if you must. Why hurt Lily? She's so kind!"

Stella shook her head. "Adrian, you don't understand women at all."

"I don't need to."

"You do," Stella stood up, meeting his gaze. "Every mother would protect her child with her life. If she knew she was pregnant, she wouldn't have risked provoking me."

Adrian sneered. "You've never been a mother. What gives you the right to say that?"

Stella's eyes burned with conviction. "I have more right than Lily! She knew she was pregnant and still came to pick a fight. She wanted to miscarry!"

Adrian suddenly exploded with rage, gripping her throat. "Stella, if anything happens to Lily, I'll make you pay with your life!"

As her breath grew shallow, she managed a smile. "Oh?"

"I mean it."

"Fine." Stella pointed at the hand around her neck. "Can you let go now?"

Adrian didn't budge. "What do you really want?"

Stella curled her lips. "You might not believe me, but all I've ever wanted... is you."

Adrian flung her onto the bed. She coughed violently as his cold voice cut through the air. "In your dreams."

The metallic taste of blood rose in her throat. Gritting her teeth, she stood and reached for his hand. "Come on. Let's go see the stars."

Adrian jerked away. "Don't touch me."

The night sky stretched above them, the moon a polished mirror, the stars scattered like diamonds.

Adrian said, "The forecast says it'll rain starting tomorrow."

Stella nodded. "So?"

"No stars for the next six days."

"The stars are always there," Stella murmured. "They're just hidden behind the clouds."

Just like her, always waiting for Adrian to turn back.

All these years, she'd fantasized countless times—just one glance, one word of concern from him, and she'd run into his arms without hesitation.

But—

Not once.

His heart had long belonged to someone else.

Adrian's voice was frigid. "What I mean is, you don't need to come for the next six days."

"You don't want to watch the stars with me anymore?"

Adrian scoffed. "What do you think? If it weren't for Lily, why would I waste time stargazing with the viper who killed my parents?"

The wind on the rooftop was fierce, whipping her dress around her as she sat on the edge.

Adrian stood behind her, his right hand slightly raised.

Suddenly, she spoke as if reading his mind. "Do you really want to push me off?"
###Chapter 11: If This Is What You Want

Adrian's hand froze midair as if paralyzed.

"Push me down," Stella whispered. "With me gone, nothing stands between you and Lily."

He jerked his hand back and turned away. "I'm not as cruel as you. I could never harm those who raised me. I hate you, but I won't resort to murder."

Stella tilted her face upward, her smile bittersweet. "Adrian, I'm giving the Roland family back to you."

"What?"

"I never wanted the Rolands." Her voice was feather-light. "Losing your parents hurt me more than anyone. Whatever you want, I'll give it."

Adrian scoffed. "You can't give me what I want."

"What if I can?"

"I want to marry Lily immediately."

Stella nodded. "In six days, you'll have your wish."

"I want the Valentine family ruined. I want you kneeling before my parents' memorial to confess your sins."

Her lashes fluttered. "...I'll kneel. They treated me as their own. I owe them that."

She deserved to kneel.

If she hadn't loved Adrian, if the Rolands hadn't cherished her like a daughter, Lily wouldn't have killed them.

The memory of their kind faces made her chest ache as if sliced by a dull blade.

"Anything else?" she asked.

The wind swallowed his words: "I want you to jump now. Can you do that?"

Stella swayed her dangling legs. Five stories up—certain death.

Her answer came without hesitation: "If you want me to, I'll jump."

"Another six-day delay?" Adrian crossed his arms mockingly. "What can six days of stargazing change?"

She tucked wind-tossed hair behind her ear. The starry sky glittered like diamonds, heartbreakingly beautiful.

"Nothing will change."

Precisely because nothing could change, she wanted to clutch these last fragments of light.

Adrian turned away. "I've seen enough. I won't stay another second."

His footsteps faded decisively.

Watching his car disappear into the night, Stella suddenly coughed up blood. The crimson splatter looked grotesque under the moonlight.

Before losing consciousness, she felt a twisted relief.

At least he'd left. At least he hadn't seen.

Otherwise, he'd accuse her of acting again.

Him leaving... was for the best.

"Stella! Wake up! Why are you sleeping here?"

Who...?

Had Adrian returned?

Stella forced her eyes open to daylight. The stars had transformed into a downpour, drenching her completely.

A gust of wind made her shiver like a leaf.

A warm coat enveloped her.

Recognizing the newcomer, her lips curved into a complicated smile.

"...You came."
###Chapter 12 She Had No Strength Left to Argue

Stella Valentine opened her eyes to the sound of torrential rain outside.

Heavy droplets pounded against the floor-to-ceiling windows, blurring the world beyond. She lay in her familiar bed, buried beneath a soft down comforter.

"Little Star!"

Martha Clementson pushed open the door carrying a steaming bowl of red date soup, her wrinkled face etched with concern. "You're finally awake!"

Stella struggled to sit up and accepted the bowl. The sweet aroma of dates spread across her tongue, but couldn't dispel the chill in her heart.

"Martha..." Her voice came out hoarse. "Don't you hate me?"

The elderly woman's rough hand caressed her cheek. "I did. But I know you're not that kind of girl."

Stella's eyes instantly welled up.

"Young Master Adrian..." Martha hesitated. "He's been blinded by hatred all these years. That Lily Savigny—"

"It's over." Stella cut her off, fingers unconsciously rubbing the edge of the blanket.

A flash of lightning outside illuminated her pale face.

"You were unconscious for two days and one night." Martha fretted. "Kept talking in your sleep, clutching your pillow and crying..."

Stella abruptly looked up.

Four days left.

Her hands trembled as she plugged in her phone. When the screen lit up, the weather forecast appeared—heavy rain warnings for the next four days.

"Hah..." She suddenly laughed.

"Little Star?"

"Nothing." She shook her head. "Just thinking... even heaven is helping him."

Martha touched her burning forehead and gasped. "You're burning up! We must go to the hospital!"

"I won't go."

"Be good!" Martha coaxed her like a child. "When you're better, I'll buy you star candies."

Stella's nose stung.

The old woman was already dialing. "Young Master, Little Star has a high fever..."

A long silence came from the other end.

"Put her on." Adrian Roland's icy voice finally spoke.

Martha happily handed over the phone and quietly closed the door behind her.

Stella gripped the phone until her knuckles turned white.

"Adrian..."

"Stella Valentine," the voice on the line was laced with venom. "You blocked my number, so now you're using Martha as your messenger?"
###Chapter 13 More Terrifying Than Any Beast

Stella Valentine stared at her phone screen, fingertips trembling slightly.

"You blocked me?"

Adrian Roland's icy voice came through the receiver. "I told you, there won't be any stars these days. In seven days, we're getting divorced."

She suddenly laughed. "Adrian, do I look like a man-eater to you?"

"Even floods and wild beasts aren't as terrifying as you."

A sharp pain pierced Stella's chest, her nose stinging. "Do you think my heart can't feel pain?"

That's why he could stab her so mercilessly.

"Your heart is harder than stone. How could it hurt?"

"You'll regret this."

"Yes, my biggest regret is ever meeting you."

The call ended with a violent click.

Stella tossed her phone aside and smiled bitterly.

She should've known better than to humiliate herself.

A soft knock came at the door. Martha Clementson peeked in. "Stella, how did it go with the young master? He used to dote on you so much—"

"Martha." Stella cut her off, forcing a smile. "I'd love some of your chicken wonton soup."

Relieved by her calm demeanor, Martha nodded. "I'll make it right away. The young master loves it too, so I'll prepare extra—"

Stella remained silent.

He wouldn't come.

Martha suddenly clapped her hands. "Oh! The day the old master had his accident, a suspicious mechanic from the 4S shop came by. When the young master arrives, I must tell him—"

"Did you see their face?"

"It was a young woman. I thought it was strange at the time—"

Stella bolted upright. "Lily Savigny works at a 4S shop!"

Martha's face paled. "You don't mean—"

"She admitted it herself. She tampered with the car!"

"Oh heavens!" Martha gasped. "When the young master comes, I'll tell him everything!"

Stella's pulse quickened.

Adrian didn't believe her, but he'd trust Martha.

With trembling hands, she took out her phone and pressed record. "Sweetheart, Mommy found a way... Once Daddy learns the truth, I'll bring him to see you..."

A metallic taste flooded her throat. She turned her head and spat out blood.

Wiping the traces away hastily, she curled under the blankets.

Her body alternated between chills and fever as consciousness slipped away.

In her dream, Adrian held her tenderly, apologizing, promising to visit their baby...

BANG!

A deafening crash jolted her awake.

"Martha?"

Silence.

Outside, the rain had stopped.

On the lawn, a twisted figure lay in a pool of glaring crimson.

"Martha—!!!"
###Chapter 14: Bloodstained Lies

Stella's vision blurred.

How could Martha... how could she have fallen from the rooftop?

Barefoot, she rushed downstairs, the cold stone steps biting into her soles.

Lily was already standing on the lawn, her fingers lightly brushing Martha's cheek. "What a pity. She's already gone."

"It was you..."

"I almost forgot," Lily straightened up, her skirt stained with blood. "This old woman watched you grow up. So loyal to you."

Stella trembled. "She did nothing wrong!"

"Her mistake was knowing too much." Lily's smile was eerie under the moonlight. "Those who see what they shouldn't deserve to die."

"You're insane!"

Lily caressed her flat stomach. "If I can abandon my own flesh and blood, what's a mere servant?"

The sudden ring of a phone shattered the tension.

"Adrian, come quick!" Lily's voice instantly turned tearful. "Stella pushed Martha off the roof!"

Stella heard the sound of shattering glass through the phone.

To Adrian, Martha had been his last remaining family.

"Lily," Stella sneered. "You belong in Hollywood."

"Say what you want." Lily waved the phone. "With no witnesses left, I'll always be the pure one in his heart."

A screeching brake pierced the night.

Adrian stumbled to Martha's side, his fingers trembling, afraid to touch her.

Lily immediately clung to him. "Adrian, don't look—"

"Stella!"

She was lifted by her throat, her feet dangling in the air.

"Why?" Adrian's voice was raw with anguish.

Stella managed a weak smile. "If I said it wasn't me, would you believe me?"

"What do you think?"

"Right." She closed her eyes. "I was the only one in the villa. Who else could it be?"

Adrian's knuckles turned white. "First my parents, now Martha. What kind of heart do you have?!"

"Adrian, stop!" Lily feigned concern. "Miss Stella must have just wanted to see you so badly that she—"

"Because I didn't watch the stars with you?" Adrian's breath burned against her face. "So you killed my last family member?"

Stella looked at Lily. "You even prepared my lines for me."

"A life for a life." Adrian spoke through gritted teeth. "Do you really think I won't do it?"

Lily grabbed his arm. "Miss Stella just loves you too much..."

"Lily, go home first."

"I want to stay with you—"

How ironic.

The same words, spoken to different people, carried entirely different meanings.

"Really going to kill me?" Stella whispered.

"The police are on their way." Adrian released her. "Killing you would stain my hands."

Stella adjusted her collar. "Then I'll go have some wonton soup first."

"You—"

"Don't worry." She walked toward the kitchen. "By the time I finish this last meal, the police should be here."
###Chapter 15: Miracle of Life

The aroma of Martha's chicken wonton soup still lingered in the air.

The interrogation lights at the police station were blinding.

Stella Valentine squinted, suddenly remembering the kind smile Martha had given her the last time they met.

"Miss Valentine, the evidence is irrefutable. Do you have anything to say in your defense?"

She shook her head lightly. "Lily Savigny testified?"

"Yes."

"And the physical evidence?"

"The rooftop only had footprints from the three of you."

Stella suddenly smiled. "If I confess, how long will my sentence be?"

"Death penalty."

"Will it hurt?"

"Lethal injection is painless."

She nodded. "Good."

The officer slid a confession form toward her. "Sign here."

"Can I have three more days?"

"Why?"

"I might... be pregnant."

Three days later, in the hospital corridor.

A female officer handed her a glass of water. "Drink something."

Stella shook her head. "It'll hurt."

"Stomach problems?"

"Stage four lung cancer." The doctor approached with test results. "Congratulations, you're pregnant."

Her head snapped up. Trembling fingers took the report.

"But you only have nine months left to live."

Stella gently traced the paper with her fingertips, smiling softly. "This is good."

The officer hesitated. "Pregnant women can receive medical parole..."

"No need." She carefully folded the report. "This is enough."

At the end of the hallway, a familiar little boy came running.

"Auntie! Mommy says thank you for the money!"

She knelt down. "Auntie won't be coming anymore."

"Did Auntie get better?"

"...Yes."

The boy began singing cheerfully, his voice clear and bright.

Tears suddenly streamed down Stella's face.

"Don't cry, Auntie. I'll miss you."

A phone rang abruptly.

"Miss Valentine, Mr. Roland has scheduled your divorce proceedings for today."
###Chapter 16: Homeless

Stella Valentine's throat tightened as if something was lodged in it.

"Miss Valentine? Are you still there?"

"Yes." She swallowed hard. "Will Adrian Roland be there for the divorce proceedings?"

"Mr. Roland has authorized me to handle everything."

"Tell him to come." Her nails dug into her palms. "I have something to tell him."

Damian Chamberlain sighed uncomfortably. "You know he doesn't want to see you."

Of course she knew.

But...

"Tell him I'm pregnant."

"What?!"

"I'm carrying his child. I need to see him."

Silence stretched for several seconds before Damian spoke again, his voice laced with pity. "Miss Valentine... Mr. Roland has already left the country with Lily Savigny. She just had a miscarriage and is traumatized. They're on a plane right now."

"...How long?"

"At least a year. Miss Savigny wants to travel the world..."

"..."

"Mr. Roland has arranged all company matters. He only wants to focus on accompanying Miss Savigny now."

Stella closed her eyes. Her chest ached as if being struck repeatedly by a blunt object. Adrian always knew how to make her numb with pain.

"I understand."

"Will you come to the civil affairs bureau now?"

"No."

"Miss Valentine..."

"Don't worry." She laughed softly. "Divorce or widowhood—it makes no difference to him. I'll give him whatever he wants."

Static crackled through the line. "What did you say?"

"Nothing. Goodbye."

A female officer nearby looked at her with concern. "Miss Valentine, do you need to go home and rest? Where do you live?"

Stella gently touched her flat stomach, a tender smile playing on her lips.

"Home? I lost that a long time ago."

......

One year later.

Houston International Airport.

Lily Savigny clung to Adrian Roland's arm, pouting. "Why do you keep frowning?"

Adrian rubbed his temples. "I just feel uneasy."

"Missing home?" She leaned against his shoulder. "Don't forget your promise—we'll get married as soon as we return."

"Mm." He pulled out his phone. "I'll get some water and have Damian bring the divorce papers."

Lily kissed his cheek.

As Adrian stepped aside to make the call, an unknown number flashed on his screen.

"Mr. Roland?" The voice on the other end was urgent. "You need to come to City Hospital immediately! Your child's surgery requires your signature!"

"What child?"

"No mistake! Your wife scheduled a stem cell transplant, but we can't reach her—"

Adrian was baffled when Damian's call came through.

"Mr. Roland," Damian's tone was grave. "You should come to the hospital."

"What's going on?"

"Miss Valentine... she just..."
###Chapter 17: Blood-Stained Ventilator

"What did you say?"

Adrian's heart clenched violently, as if squeezed by an invisible hand. He instinctively pressed a hand to his chest, brows furrowed. "What happened to her?"

"Miss Stella—"

"Adrian!" A shrill scream cut through the call. Lily collapsed onto the lawn, clutching her ankle with tears in her eyes. "It hurts so much..."

Nearby, a small boy stood frozen, clutching a tattered soccer ball.

"Mr. Roland?" Damian's urgent voice crackled through the phone.

Adrian's gaze locked onto Lily. "Lily's hurt. Handle the hospital matter yourself."

"But Miss Stella—"

"What scheme is she pulling now?"

"It's not like that! Miss Stella is in critical condition. The doctors said—"

Lily's sobs suddenly intensified. "Adrian, I can't stand up..."

He ended the call decisively. "I see through her tricks. Don't fall for them."

Striding toward Lily, he knelt to examine her injury. Her pale ankle was already swollen, streaks of blood visible.

"How did this happen?"

She bit her lip, tears rolling down. "It was my fault... What did Damian want?"

"Nothing important." He scooped her into his arms. As he turned, his sleeve was lightly tugged.

The boy looked up, eyes red. "I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to..."

Adrian's expression darkened. "No ball games in public areas."

"I know." The boy pulled crumpled bills from his pocket, hands trembling. "This is all I have for medical fees..."

His small hands were dotted with needle marks, still bearing cotton balls from recent injections.

"Where are your parents?"

"Mom's cleaning..." The boy's voice faded. "The ball didn't hit her. She walked into it..."

Lily leaned weakly against Adrian's shoulder. "Don't blame the child."

The hospital reeked of antiseptic.

The doctor adjusted his glasses. "A mild sprain. Rest for two days."

"Thank you, Doctor." Adrian exhaled in relief.

The doctor smiled at them. "Newlyweds? You're lucky, miss. This morning we admitted a young mother with terminal lung cancer. So tragic..."

Lily's eyes flickered. "How is she?"

"Stabilized for now, but with late-stage cancer and postpartum weakness..." The doctor shook his head. "No family has come."

Adrian pinched Lily's cheek. "Worry about yourself first."

"I can't bear seeing others suffer." She clung to his neck like a spoiled child.

His phone rang again. Lily snatched it and declined the call. "Today's our wedding day. You promised to stay with me."

"Fine. Let's get you home."

As they drove away, Lily scrolled through his call log. Seeing "Damian Chamberlain," she smirked and deleted the record.

"The number you dialed is currently unavailable..."

Damian paced frantically. The surgery consent form required a family signature, but Adrian's phone stayed unreachable.

A weak moan came from the hospital bed.

"Miss Stella!" Damian rushed to her side.

Stella's pale lips trembled. "My... children..."

"They need immediate surgery. Can you sign?"

With great effort, she lifted a finger. Damian placed a pen in her grip, guiding her hand to leave a shaky signature.

As the pen clattered to the floor, Stella whispered, "Adrian..."

"Mr. Roland said Miss Savigny was injured. Then he stopped answering."

A spray of crimson blood bloomed across the oxygen mask like a withering rose.
###Chapter 18: Where Did I Lose?

"Mom..."

A faint voice pierced through her dreams.

Stella Valentine jolted awake, the blinding fluorescent lights making her vision swim.

The sharp scent of antiseptic reminded her she was still in the hospital.

"Miss Valentine, you're awake!" The nurse pressed the call button in relief. "You've been unconscious for four days. The doctors were worried—"

"My children..." She struggled to sit up, but a searing pain in her abdomen forced her back with a gasp.

"Don't move! You just had lung resection surgery. You'll tear your stitches."

Lung resection?

She looked down at the bandages swathing her chest, the dull ache finally registering.

"The cancer spread too quickly. We had to remove a third of your right lung." The nurse handed her a glass of water. "Avoid strenuous activity from now on."

"Then I..."

"With regular chemotherapy, you might buy some more time." The nurse avoided her hopeful gaze. "As for how long..."

"I understand."

Stella turned to the window. Every extra day was a gift—she should have died in that rainy alley years ago.

Knock, knock, knock.

The sound interrupted her thoughts.

"Family?" The nurse eyed the impeccably dressed man at the door.

His gaze behind gold-rimmed glasses was tender as water. "Yes."

The door clicked shut.

"Mr. Merovingian, what brings you here?" Stella forced a weak smile.

"If I waited any longer, I might miss my last chance to see you." Hugo Merovingian traced her gaunt cheek with his fingertips. "You hid this from even me?"

"It's not exactly good news..."

"So you planned to die quietly?" His fingers suddenly tightened on her chin. "Stella, even if you rejected my proposal, we're still friends at least."

"I..."

"Come to America with me." He released her and pulled plane tickets from his briefcase. "Bring the children."

She shook her head.

"Still hung up on him?" Hugo's smile turned icy. "Tell me, what does Adrian Roland have that I don't?"

Memories of that rainy night six years ago surfaced—the night Adrian's family fell apart. This was the man who had fished her lifeless body from the river.

Knowing her heart belonged to another. Knowing she carried another man's children.

"I gave you space." He smoothed her disheveled hair. "But this time, I won't let you face it alone."

"Mr. Merovingian..."

"5,276 times." He abruptly said.

"What?"

"That's how many times you've thanked me." Hugo removed his glasses to clean them. "2,192 days over six years—averaging 2.5 times daily. You've always kept me at arm's length."

Stella fell silent.

She'd never thanked Adrian. That boy had spoiled her rotten, granting her every whim.

"I can't win arguments with you." She gave a bitter laugh.

"There's your smile." His thumb brushed the corner of her lips. "You should smile more often."

Hurried footsteps echoed in the hallway.

The door flew open before Hugo could react, sending him stumbling back—
###Chapter 19: I Said, Get Out

Adrian Roland pushed the door open, his gaze slicing through Hugo Merovingian like a blade.

A mocking smile curled his lips. "Stella Valentine, you certainly know how to pick your moments."

Stella instinctively tightened her grip on the bedsheet. "Let me explain—"

"Explain what?" Adrian's voice was icy. "Damian Chamberlain said you were dying. You seem perfectly fine to me."

"Must you always speak like this?"

"What would you prefer?" He stepped closer to the bed. "Another one of your lies?"

Her chest rose and fell rapidly.

She should have known better. No explanation would ever be enough.

Five years. No matter what she said, he would always see it as an excuse.

"Tell me about the child," Adrian demanded abruptly.

Stella let out a bitter laugh. "Would you even believe me if I did?"

"Try me."

"After the car accident six years ago, I found out I was pregnant." Her voice was barely above a whisper. "You refused to see me. I had to go abroad to give birth. He's been frail since childhood, always in and out of hospitals—"

"Nice story." Adrian cut her off. "I heard everything just now. You've known each other for six years. Two thousand one hundred ninety-two days. You only came back because the child was sick. So who took care of him overseas?"

"I did." Hugo spoke up for the first time. "Mr. Roland, I've heard much about you. Though after today, your judgment in matters of the heart is... disappointing."

Adrian's eyes turned glacial. "You have no right to judge."

Stella forced herself upright. "Hugo, please go."

Hugo held her gaze for a long moment. "I'll handle the child's situation. Remember what I said—file for divorce as soon as possible."

As he turned to leave, Adrian blocked the doorway, unmoving.

"Move," Hugo said coolly.

The two men stood locked in a silent battle of wills before Adrian finally stepped aside.

The moment the door clicked shut, Stella collapsed back onto the bed, exhaustion washing over her.

Her wounds throbbed with fresh pain.

"Can't bear to see him go?" Adrian's voice was venomous. "That attached?"

She closed her eyes briefly. "Yes. I can't bear it. Happy now?"

"So you admit it?" He grabbed her chin roughly. "That child is his, isn't it?"

Pain shot through her jaw, but she refused to make a sound.

"What man would raise another's child for five years?" Adrian sneered. "Unless it was his own."

"Get out."

He froze. "What did you say?"

"I said—" She enunciated each word slowly, "get the hell out!"

Never in her life had she raised her voice at him like this.

Adrian stood rooted to the spot.

His mind flashed back to the frantic drive here, his heart pounding in his chest.

Damian had told him she had a five-year-old son.

If the child was his...

The thought surfaced for only a second before he crushed it mercilessly.

How could he show weakness to the woman who killed his father?

Yet when he'd burst into that hospital room, what he'd heard was another man claiming to have known her for six years.

In that moment, he'd never felt more like a fool.

He'd known she was lying.

And still, he'd come running.

Like an idiot.
###Chapter 20: Blood for Blood

Adrian Roland stepped out of the hospital room. As the elevator doors closed, his phone screen lit up.

Lily Savigny's name flashed on the display.

"Adrian, where are you? Damian said you didn't show up at the firm today."

His knuckles turned white as he answered. "Out."

"Did you visit her?" Lily's voice held a probing tone. "How is she?"

"Her death means nothing to me." Adrian's voice was ice.

Silence stretched on the other end.

"Adrian, let's finalize the divorce soon." Lily's voice softened. "I can't keep living like this—"

"Enough!" His sharp interruption startled her. "This isn't the time."

Lily hesitated. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing." He drew a slow breath. "Focus on recovering."

Ending the call, Adrian immediately dialed his assistant.

"Vincent, investigate the biological father of Stella's two children."

"And get me her complete medical records."

Stella Valentine dragged her weakened body to the pediatric ward.

Through the glass, she saw her son gazing up at Hugo Merovingian.

"Uncle Hugo, will my sister like me?"

Hugo ruffled the boy's hair. "Of course. You'll be the best big brother."

"When can Mommy visit?" Ethan's eyes sparkled.

"Soon." Hugo's voice tightened.

Ethan suddenly lowered his voice. "Uncle Hugo, I have a secret."

"What is it?"

"I know you're not my dad." The boy blinked. "But I wish you were."

Hugo froze.

"Because you're nice to Mommy." Ethan spoke with solemn gravity. "If Daddy makes her sad, I don't want him anymore."

The nurse adjusting his IV blinked back tears.

"Such a sweet boy," she murmured.

Ethan smiled shyly. "Nurse, can you fix my hair? I want to look handsome for Mommy."

Outside, Stella clamped a hand over her mouth.

Tears blurred her vision as she stifled every sound.

Hugo stepped out, draping his coat over her shoulders.

"You'll frighten him looking like this."

She shook her head, nails biting into her palms.

"I will survive." Her voice scraped raw. "For my children. And for justice."

Hugo studied her. "Where's your proof?"

She lifted tear-burned eyes blazing with hatred.

"Lily. The Rolands. My father's death. Ethan's illness..." Each word fell like a hammer strike. "I'll make them pay for every drop of blood owed."

At the corridor's end, a security camera rotated silently.
###Chapter 21: The Choice Before Farewell

"Hugo, I need to ask you a favor."

Hugo Merovingian set down his documents, giving her his full attention. "Go ahead."

"Take Ethan back to the U.S."

His brows furrowed slightly. "Why this sudden decision?"

Stella Valentine turned to the window. Sunlight filtered through the glass, casting dappled shadows across her pale face. "My time is running out. It's better he has fewer memories than watch his mother fade away."

"Stella, that's too cruel for a child."

She shook her head gently, fingers absently tracing the hem of her hospital gown.

Cruel?

Compared to letting her son face Lily Savigny's schemes, this was the gentlest choice.

Besides, that man had never shown Ethan an ounce of fatherly love.

"The sooner, the better."

The day Ethan left, dark clouds hung oppressively low.

Stella stood by the window until the last wisp of cloud vanished from the sky.

A nurse entered. "Miss Valentine, it's time for your dressing change."

As the bandage peeled away, she sucked in a sharp breath.

"The wound is healing well," the nurse said gently. "You can cry out if it hurts."

"Can I have some painkillers?"

The nurse hesitated. "I'll consult the doctor. But we must monitor the dosage."

When the pill bottle landed in her palm, Stella counted them—twenty.

Enough to last until her plan was complete.

"Let's proceed with the dressing change," she said suddenly, tucking the bottle into the drawer. "I can bear this much pain."

The phone rang abruptly.

"Miss, your mother's condition has worsened—"

Stella's fingers clenched. "What's wrong with Grace?"

"You should come see her immediately."

She grabbed her coat, slipping two pills into her bag.

The iron gates of the Valentine estate had been replaced.

The once star-adorned wrought iron now bore gaudy gilt roses.

"You've finally returned," an elderly servant whispered. "Madame Grace was moved to the guest room."

Muffled sobs echoed from the end of the hallway.

When the door opened, the musty air assaulted her.

"Mom..."

The figure on the bed stirred weakly. "Little star?"

Stella bit her lip hard.

Her elegant mother had withered to skin and bones.

"Don't let your uncle hear," Grace Laurent grasped her daughter's hand anxiously. "It will upset him."

"This is our home!" Stella's voice trembled.

Grace shook her head. "Don't speak of such things. Have you...made up with Adrian?"

"We're doing well." Stella forced a smile. "We just had a baby girl. I'll bring her to see you next time."

A faint light flickered in her mother's clouded eyes.

Stella turned away, nails digging into her palms.

This lie was the last comfort she could give.
###Chapter 22: A Deadly Wager

Grace Laurent's clouded eyes suddenly brightened at the news of her granddaughter. "Really? When did this happen?"

"Recently."

"You silly girl, why didn't you tell me such important news?" Grace's trembling hands removed the jade bracelet from her wrist and pressed it into Stella's palm. "Your father gave this to me as a token of love. I've worn it for over twenty years. Let it be my gift to my granddaughter."

At the mention of her father, both women's eyes welled up.

"Your father adored you. As long as you and Adrian are happy, he can rest in peace."

"...Yes." Stella swallowed her tears. "Mom, let me take you to the hospital first."

Before she could finish, the door burst open.

Stella turned, her pupils contracting sharply.

"What are you doing here?"

Lily Savigny strode in on stiletto heels, crimson lips curling. "I live here now."

"You?"

Grace shrank back, clutching her daughter's hand with trembling fingers. "Stella...she's the stepdaughter your aunt brought into the family..."

Stella narrowed her eyes.

Lily was more formidable than she'd anticipated.

This woman was cunning, ruthless, and knew exactly how to manipulate men—no wonder she'd ensnared Adrian so completely.

What surprised Stella more was Lily's connection to her uncle's family. After the car accident years ago, her uncle had been the primary beneficiary. Now it seemed likely he'd been involved.

But with Ethan safe now, she had nothing left to fear.

"Miss Savigny, we meet at last." Stella extended her hand with a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

Lily arched an eyebrow, refusing the handshake as she scrutinized Stella warily.

Withdrawing her hand, Stella kept her tone gentle. "Did you need something from my mother?"

"Not me. Adrian." Lily lifted her chin. "He has questions for her."

"Where is he?"

"On his way."

"Questions about the accident six years ago?" Stella chuckled softly. "Miss Savigny, we both know the truth. If Adrian keeps digging, you won't like the consequences. So do us both a favor—stop him. My mother is ill and needs hospitalization."

She helped Grace to her feet. "Let's go, Mom."

"Wait." Lily blocked their path. "Miss Valentine, a word in private?"

"We have nothing to discuss."

"Not even about saving your mother's life?" Lily leaned in, whispering, "Divorce him immediately if you want her to live."

Stella's laugh was icy. "I'll save my mother myself. As for divorce—the power is in my hands now. Push me further, and I'll never sign those papers."

"How long can a dying woman hold out?"

"Care to wager on it?"

"On what?"

"On how long I'll survive. Every day I breathe, I remain Adrian's lawful wife while you skulk in shadows. Let's see whether death claims me first—or Adrian uncovers your crimes."

"You—!" Lily's flawless face twisted. "Stella Valentine, know your place!"

Stella shrugged. "What do I have left to lose? What can you possibly do to me?"

She guided her mother past Lily and out to the car.

During the drive, Grace fretted. "Stella, about the accident—"

"Later." Stella squeezed her hand. "Your health comes first."

The diagnosis was devastating.

The doctor's expression darkened. "Severe anemia compounded by advanced pneumonia—clearly from prolonged malnutrition and neglected illness. What kind of family neglects their elder like this? A few more days, and it would've been too late!"

Stella's fists clenched. She never imagined her uncle's family would abuse her mother so cruelly—his own sister!

Grace, pale as parchment, still worried for her daughter. "Don't confront your uncle...he's too powerful now..."

The words cut Stella to the core.

What had she been doing all these years?

Groveling for a man who despised her, while her own mother suffered?

Did Adrian know?

Even if he did, he'd turn a blind eye. To him, her father would always be his parents' murderer.

"Admit her immediately." The doctor handed over a bill. "Payment at the first-floor counter."

After settling Grace in her room, Stella approached the cashier.

"$3,820."

"Here."

The card was rejected. "This one's frozen. Another?"

One after another, all her cards were declined.

The clerk offered sympathy. "Perhaps contact a family member? The patient needs medication."

Stella smiled bitterly. All accounts were under the Valentine name—now controlled by her uncle.

Lily's retaliation.

But Grace couldn't wait.

Scrolling through her contacts, Stella found all old friends long estranged. These years spent chasing Adrian had isolated her completely.

At life's most critical moment, she had no one.

"...Stella Valentine?" A familiar voice spoke behind her.
###Chapter 23: The Daughter Was Taken Away

The hospital corridor was bathed in sterile white light. Stella Valentine leaned against the wall as she walked slowly.

She suddenly stopped.

A young woman with immaculate makeup stood before her, studying her with curious eyes.

"...Joy Fairsprene?" Stella hesitated.

"Oh my God, it really is you!" The girl gasped, covering her mouth. "Stella, you've lost so much weight!"

Stella instinctively tugged at her oversized loungewear.

Joy remained as warm as ever, linking arms with her. "Is your mother sick? Do you need help?"

Stella's fingers twisted together unconsciously.

"Joy, could you..." Her voice grew quieter. "Lend me some money?"

Without hesitation, Joy pulled out her wallet. "Take this card. The PIN is my birthday."

Tears pricked Stella's eyes.

She remembered the overweight girl from high school who was always bullied. Now, Joy had transformed into someone radiant.

"You married Adrian, right?" Joy suddenly asked.

Stella's fingers twitched.

"Yes," she whispered.

Joy sighed wistfully. "You two were the most envied couple in school."

Stella stared at her reflection on the tiled floor.

The vibrant girl in floral sundresses was gone, replaced by a hollow shell.

When she returned to the hospital room, her mother was already asleep.

A nurse recognized her. "Miss Valentine, your wounds—"

Stella pressed a finger to her lips.

She pulled the nurse into the office and bowed deeply. "Please don't tell my mother."

The nurse hesitated. "But your condition—"

"Consider it a dying wish." Stella's voice cracked.

The nurse finally sighed. "I promise."

Relief washed over Stella.

She wanted to see her daughter.

The pediatric ward was eerily empty.

Only a small blanket remained in the crib.

"Where's the baby?" She grabbed a passing nurse.

The nurse gave her a puzzled look. "Her father took her."
###Chapter 24: The Mysterious Invitation

Stella Valentine's fingers trembled.

She stared at her phone screen, Adrian Roland's number glaring back at her. But she knew—she'd been blocked long ago.

"Can I borrow your phone?" Her hoarse voice cracked as she reached toward the nurse.

The moment the call connected, Stella's heart threatened to burst from her chest.

"Adrian Roland! Give me back my daughter!"

"Miss Valentine?"

That voice made Stella's spine stiffen instantly. Lily Savigny.

"Put Adrian on the phone." She gritted her teeth.

"He's showering." Lily's tone dripped with victorious smugness. "Your daughter is adorable. Adrian says I'll be raising her from now on."

Stella's nails dug into her palms. "Don't you dare touch my child!"

"Oh dear, the little one's crying." A baby's wail pierced through the receiver. "Imagine if such a pretty face got... scarred."

"Lily Savigny!"

"Sign the divorce papers within three days, or else..." Lily's light chuckle sent chills down Stella's spine. "You understand."

Stella forced down her rage. "My mother is still hospitalized—"

"That old hag?" Lily cut her off. "The sooner she dies, the better."

The line went dead.

Stella stood frozen in the hospital corridor, icy dread seeping into her bones. Her mother was critically ill. Her daughter had been stolen. She couldn't even afford the medical bills.

Her borrowed phone vibrated suddenly.

[Want to save your mother? Houston Grand Hotel. Room 1231. 9 PM.]

Her finger hovered over the keyboard as she stared at the unknown number.

[Who is this?]

[Someone who can help.]

......

Adrian stepped out of the shower, towel-drying his hair while cradling the freshly bathed infant.

The baby blinked up at him with wide eyes before breaking into a gummy smile.

His heart melted instantly. This was his daughter. His and Stella's child.

"Luna," he murmured, tracing the name Stella had chosen. Sun, moon, and stars—their youthful promise etched into this tiny life.

Lily sidled closer. "What a beautiful name."

Adrian's expression hardened. "Just something that came to mind."

"I'll care for her like my own." Lily reached toward the baby's face.

Adrian pivoted away. "Martha will handle it."

"You don't trust me?" Lily's face darkened.

"Your ankle injury hasn't healed." He settled the baby into the crib. "Who called earlier?"

"Wrong number." Lily turned away.

Adrian's tone shifted abruptly. "You're Victor Lefèvre's stepdaughter?"

Lily went rigid.

"My mother... she didn't know when she married him—"

"Victor Lefèvre destroyed my parents' legacy." Adrian's gaze turned glacial. "And you kept this from me."

"We share no blood!" Lily clutched his arm. "Adrian, you have to believe—"

A sudden wail erupted from the crib. Adrian immediately scooped up the distressed infant.

In the shadowed corner, Lily's eyes burned with venom as she watched them.
###Chapter 25: How Many More Secrets Are You Hiding?

Adrian's gaze turned icy, freezing the air between them.

Lily's fingertips trembled. She had kept this secret for six years without a single slip.

Her plan was to confess after their marriage certificate was signed. By then, it would be too late for him to back out. Even if he was furious, she could soften him with her gentle persistence.

But today, he suddenly wanted to visit the Valentine residence.

And Stella was there!

She had no choice but to provoke Stella, forcing her to leave with her mother. If they met, the consequences would be disastrous.

Lately, Adrian had grown distant—especially after returning from the hospital.

Her instincts told her Stella was behind this.

"Adrian..." Lily wrapped her arms around his waist from behind, pressing her cheek against his back. "Are you hungry? I can make you some noodles."

"No need."

"Then... should I prepare Luna's bottle?"

"I'll do it." Adrian gently poked the baby's dimple as she giggled in his arms. "Little traitor. You smile for anyone who holds you."

The baby cooed, blowing tiny bubbles.

"Adrian..."

Her whining shattered the tender moment between father and daughter.

His brow furrowed. "What is it?"

His cold tone stung. "...Nothing."

"Lily, I want no secrets between us." He turned to face her directly. "Do you understand?"

She bit her lip and nodded.

"Then tell me now—are you hiding anything else?"

"No."

"Are you sure?"

Lily suddenly flared up. "Did Stella say something to you? She hates me for taking you away! You can't trust her!"

Adrian looked away. "Just asking."

"...I don’t even mind being a stepmother. How can you still doubt me?"

"Don’t overthink it."

Lily huffed. "I'm going to shower. I'll sleep in the guest room tonight."

This tactic always worked before.

But today, Adrian didn’t even glance up. "No need. I’m staying at the old house tonight. Benjamin will take care of Luna."

"You're going to see her?" Her voice shook.

"The old house," he corrected, lifting the baby and grabbing his keys. "I’ll be staying there for a while. Contact my secretary if you need anything."

"Adrian..."

"Go inside."

The engine roared to life as he drove away. Lily slammed the door hard behind her.

The Roland family estate stood desolate in the twilight.

Ivy crawled over the brick walls, with only a single warm light glowing from the window.

"Who’s there?" The old butler opened the door, his face lighting up. "Adrian?"

"Benjamin."

"Come in! Where’s Stella?"

Adrian’s throat tightened. "Her mother is ill."

"Then you should be with her." Benjamin sighed. "That girl acts strong, but deep down..."

The baby’s fussing interrupted him.

The old man’s eyes sparkled. "And this is...?"

"My daughter."

"Oh my!" Benjamin cradled her carefully. "Those eyes—she looks just like Stella when she was little!"

"Can you watch her for a few days?"

"Of course!" The butler held the baby protectively. "You should hurry to Stella. She must be—"

Adrian remembered Stella in the hospital.

Pale face. Defiant eyes.

The absolute finality in her voice when she told him to leave.

She was nothing like the timid girl from his memories.

"By the way," Benjamin suddenly turned serious, "your parents' accident wasn’t what it seemed. Don’t take it out on Stella."

Adrian smirked coldly. "You still believe in her?"

The old man stared in shock. "Don’t you?"
###Chapter 26: A Deal in the Darkness

The night was pitch black, the golden sign of Houston Grand Hotel glaringly bright against the darkness.

Stella Valentine clenched her phone, her knuckles turning white.

She had been pacing outside the hotel entrance for a full hour.

Her phone screen lit up again—another payment reminder from the hospital.

"Ms. Valentine, your mother's medical bills can't be delayed any longer."

She took a deep breath and looked up at the top floor of the hotel.

Room 1231.

The elevator doors slid open silently, the door at the end of the hallway looming like a beast with gaping jaws.

Ding-dong—

The chime of the doorbell made her heart pound so hard it nearly leapt out of her chest.

"Come in."

A deep male voice carried through the door, laced with undeniable command.

The room was pitch black.

Stella groped along the wall, her fingertips brushing against cold wallpaper.

"Close the door."

The man's voice came from the depths of the darkness.

Moonlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling window, outlining a vague silhouette.

"Sir, I—"

"Scared?" The man chuckled. "Now that you're here, drop the act."

Stella bit her lower lip.

She knew exactly what this meant.

"My daughter—"

"I can give you both the money and your daughter," the man interrupted. "Come here."

The sofa creaked faintly.

Stella stood frozen in place.

"Do I need to repeat myself a third time?"

She took a step forward but stopped two meters away from him.

"Sit."

The single-syllable command sent chills down her spine.

Her phone suddenly rang.

"Answer it."

The man abruptly closed the distance, his cologne mixed with the scent of tobacco enveloping her.

"Hello?"

"Is Adrian with you?" Lily Savigny's shrill voice pierced the silence.

Stella tightened her grip on the phone. "Afraid now?"

"Don't you dare say anything reckless!"

"The truth from six years ago—"

"Shut up!" Lily's voice cracked. "He... he's really there?"

Stella curled her lips. "Would you like to speak to him?"

The line went dead.

In the darkness, the man's fingers brushed against her cheek.

"Well done."
###Chapter 27: Because She Didn't Love Me

The phone line fell into prolonged silence.

Stella Valentine decisively hung up.

"More spine than I expected." The man's voice carried a hint of amusement, his warm breath brushing against the back of her ear.

She instinctively leaned away.

"Mr. Alistair..." Stella clenched the hem of her shirt. "I don't understand why you're helping me, but there are things I can't do."

"Because of the children?"

"Yes." Her voice was firm. "I need money, but I'm a mother first. I can't let them know their mother..."

The man chuckled softly. "Relax. I'm not that kind of person."

"Then why—"

Sensing her resistance, he withdrew his arm from around her waist and stepped back. "You remind me of someone. I...owe her."

Stella's eyes widened. "So I'm a replacement?"

"You could say that."

She stared at her toes with a bitter smile. "If it saves my mother and brings my daughter back, I'll do it."

"That straightforward?"

"I have no choice." Her voice cracked. "The sooner, the better."

In the darkness, the man remained silent for a long moment.

"Sleep."

He took her wrist and led her toward the bedroom. Stella stiffened. "Mr. Alistair, I told you—"

"I won't touch you."

His movements were gentle, as if handling something fragile. He guided her to the bed, knelt on one knee, and removed her shoes.

"I haven't slept well in a long time."

"Because you miss her?"

"Yes." Moonlight stretched his shadow into loneliness. "Every time I remember, it feels like a knife cutting through me."

Stella's heart trembled. "Did she...leave you?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

His Adam's apple bobbed, voice rough. "Because she—didn't love me."

The answer stole Stella's breath.

She'd imagined countless possibilities, but never this.

"Did she know you—"

"It doesn't matter now." He lifted her into his arms and laid her on the bed. "Sleep."

An unfamiliar room, an unfamiliar presence. Stella lay awake until late into the night before exhaustion finally claimed her.

In her drowsy haze, she felt a soft touch on her forehead. She strained to hear the whispered words at her ear but sank into darkness.

......

Pain tore her awake.

The painkillers had worn off. The other side of the bed was empty.

Her phone lit up.

[Thank you. First good sleep in years.]

Her finger hovered over the call button before she typed a reply: [What should I call you?]

[Mr. Alistair is fine.]

[When can I see my daughter?]

[She's safe. Focus on your mother first.]

[But she needs her mother!]

The reply came much later: [Every night at 9. There's a card on the table—$3 million. PIN is your daughter's birthday.]

The bank card gleamed coldly in the morning light.

When had Stella Valentine, heiress of the Valentine family, fallen this low?

The phone rang abruptly.

"Ms. Valentine! Your wound—"

"I'll pay the medical bills now."

She dry-swallowed painkillers and rushed to the hospital as soon as they took effect.

At the payment counter, the nurse handed back her card. "The VIP room will be ready this afternoon."

"Not now?"

"Isn't your family already here?"

Stella froze.

The elevator doors opened, revealing her mother's weak voice: "...Stella will take care of me."

"Of course."

Adrian Roland's voice turned her blood to ice.

Through the door crack, Lily Savigny placed supplements on the bedside table. "Aunt Grace, I picked these especially for your health."

"You're so thoughtful, Lily."

"Adrian brought me here—"

BANG!

The door slammed against the wall with a crash.
###Chapter 28: Keep Your First Love in Check

"Mom, don't talk too much." Stella Valentine gently pressed down her mother's trembling hand. "The doctor said you need rest."

She smoothed the pristine white sheets, her fingers leaving faint creases in the fabric.

Grace Laurent's pale lips curved into a tender smile. "Where have you been, my little star? The nurses were looking for you."

"I went to the bank to withdraw money for the medical bills." Stella sat by the bedside, clasping her mother's cool hand.

"Is there enough?" Grace asked anxiously. "You know the password to my card—"

"It's fine." Stella cut her off softly but firmly. "The Valentines may have fallen, but we can still afford hospital fees."

She lowered her lashes, hiding the bitterness in her eyes.

Her mother's card?
Already locked tight by Uncle Victor's family.

Everything under the Valentine name now belonged to the Lefèvres.

"Your uncle just forgets things sometimes..." Grace murmured.

"Mom, have some apple." Stella picked up the fruit knife. Sunlight glinted coldly off the blade.

Grace suddenly noticed Adrian Roland standing by the window. "Adrian is so thoughtful to visit despite his busy schedule. Stella, have you been giving him trouble again?"

Stella's hand stilled.

She lifted her gaze to Adrian. The man stood impeccably dressed by the window, sunlight gilding his silhouette but failing to warm those fathomless eyes.

"Not at all," she said quietly.

"Don't lie!" Grace chided. "After all Adrian has endured for you these years—"

Adrian spoke abruptly. "You flatter me."

Grace clasped their hands together. "That car accident... Our family owes yours. Adrian, if you hold any resentment, direct it at me—"

Adrian jerked his hand away.

The air froze.

"Mom," Stella broke the silence, "Adrian and I will handle our own matters."

Grace sighed. "Stubborn child..."

"Auntie," Lily Savigny interjected sweetly, "Actually, Ms. Valentine and Adrian have already—"

"Ms. Savigny!" Stella's voice turned sharp. "Would you mind fetching some hot water?"

Lily's face fell. She shot Adrian a wounded look.

The man gave a curt nod. "Go."

Once Lily left reluctantly, Stella stood. "Mom, Adrian and I need to talk privately."

Grace brightened. "Go on. Clear the air between you."

At the end of the hallway, in the stairwell.

Adrian shut the door behind them, his navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. The blue-and-white striped tie was knotted perfectly—but not in the way she'd taught him.

"You learned to tie your own tie?" The question slipped out before she could stop it.

"Lily did it." His reply was matter-of-fact.

Stella's lips twisted.

How pathetic that she'd even asked.

"Where were you last night?" Adrian suddenly closed the distance between them.

His familiar cologne enveloped her. Stella instinctively stepped back. "None of your business."

"Staying out all night while claiming to be gravely ill?" His laugh was icy. "How many lies have you told, Stella?"

"Does it matter?" She met his gaze squarely. "In your eyes, I've always been a liar."

Adrian's jaw tightened, his expression darkening.

"Let's divorce." Her voice was steady. "We'll finalize it this afternoon."

The air turned leaden.

"You smell like another man." Adrian suddenly seized her wrist. "Couldn't wait to jump into someone else's bed before the ink dries?"

Stella struggled. "Let go!"

"Who is he?" His grip tightened. "Who are you throwing yourself at now?"

"Adrian!" She winced in pain. "We're discussing divorce. Stop changing the subject!"

"Isn't this what you've always wanted?" Her laugh was brittle. "Now that I'm agreeing, why are you losing it?"

Adrian's eyes darkened dangerously. "Finally showing your true colors."

"I have one condition." Stella drew a steadying breath.

His lips curled mockingly. "Name your price."

"Keep your Lily in check." She enunciated each word. "Don't let her near my mother again."
###Chapter 29: You Promised to Protect Me

Adrian Roland's brows furrowed. "Lily has a pure heart."

"Pure?"

"She suggested visiting your mother today. Otherwise, why would I come?" His lips curled into a sneer. "For you?"

Though she had resolved to sever all ties, his words still pierced her heart like needles.

"Adrian, you always know how to hurt me the most."

His gaze flickered briefly before turning icy again. "You lied to me first."

"I didn't!"

"Then explain the car accident. Explain how your uncle seized Roland Group. And you just ran away?!"

"You hated me back then. I was pregnant and afraid you wouldn't accept the baby, so I went to the U.S. to give birth. I planned to return once you cooled down..."

Adrian's lips pressed into a thin line, his expression unreadable. "So the boy from the last surgery... is also mine?"

Stella Valentine nodded softly. "Yes."

"..."

"Ethan has sepsis and needs a stem cell transplant. I forced you into divorce so I could conceive another child for the match."

"..."

"Adrian, I never lied to you. Not once."

The air froze.

At the name "Ethan," Adrian stiffened.

Sun, Moon, Star—their childhood promise. Their son was named Felix, their daughter Luna.

And she called him Ethan.

"Stella," he closed his eyes briefly, inhaling deeply, "where is Ethan now?"

"The U.S."

His frown deepened. "With that man Hugo?"

"...Mr. Merovingian is my friend. Show some respect."

Adrian scoffed. "Was he who you met last night?"

"No." Stella suppressed her frustration. "I've told you the truth. Believe it or not. After the divorce tomorrow, I'll find a way to return Roland Group to you."

His expression softened slightly, his gaze holding something almost like... pity?

Stella smiled bitterly. Was her eyesight failing from the cancer? For a moment, she thought she saw warmth in his eyes.

But when she looked again, it was gone.

Even if Ethan stirred some compassion in him, two lives still stood between them.

And Lily Savigny was already by his side.

They... could never go back.

But perhaps it was for the best. With little time left, she only wanted to secure her mother's future and return Roland Group. Then she could die in peace.

"My condition is this: don’t let my mother know about the divorce. Her health can’t take the shock. And Lily—" Stella's voice turned cold. "I don’t know why she insisted on coming today, but she’s not welcome here again."

"How long can we hide it?"

"As long as possible." Her tone was flat. "Also, since you took Luna, keep your Lily in check. If anything happens to my daughter, I’ll haunt you both."

Adrian finally reacted. "Lily isn’t like that."

"Time will tell. I’m just warning you—don’t let Luna get hurt."

"She’s my daughter too!" Adrian growled. "I’m her father. I’ll protect her!"

Stella laughed bitterly. "Adrian, did you know? You once promised to protect me too."

"..."

"You swore to shield me for life, to never let anyone hurt me. Yet look at the hell I’ve lived through these years. Every ounce of suffering in my twenty-six years came from you."

"...That was different."

"How? Because I conspired with my uncle to kill your parents and steal Roland Group?"

"Wasn’t that enough?"

Stella smiled faintly. "What if I told you the accident was actually—"

The door creaked open.

Lily entered, holding a coffee cup. "There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere. Adrian, try the coffee I made?"

He took a sip. "Blue Mountain?"

"Your favorite. I brought ground beans, though it’s not as good as brewed. I’ll make you a proper cup at home."

Adrian nodded. "Alright."

"Oh, Ms. Valentine is here too." Lily feigned surprise. "How careless of me—I didn’t bring you a cup..."

Here we go again.

Stella cut her off. "No need. I don’t drink hot beverages."

"Why not?"

Stella smirked. "You know exactly why."

Her lung cancer—Lily was well aware. Hot drinks irritated her trachea, triggering violent coughing fits until she spat blood.

Thankfully, painkillers kept the symptoms at bay around Lily.

She’d never show weakness in front of this woman.

Adrian asked Lily, "Did you get the hot water?"

Lily nodded. "Yes. Oh, you left your phone in the ward. I brought it."

He pocketed the phone.

"Adrian."

"Hmm?"

"You got a call earlier. I answered it for you."

"Who was it?"

"Vincent Astor."

Adrian’s expression shifted. "What did he say?"

Lily pouted playfully. "He wouldn’t tell me. Said it was confidential and had to speak to you directly."

He patted her hand. "I’ll call him back. Business first."

"Of course. I’ll keep Ms. Valentine company."

"Mm."

As Adrian left, the dim stairwell held only the two women.

The masks came off instantly.

Lily’s face darkened. "What did you tell him?"

"Everything," Stella said lightly. "Including what you fear most."

Lily hissed, "He’ll never believe you!"

"Not now. But as long as I live, I’ll find proof and lay your crimes bare before him."

Lily’s eyes turned venomous. "Stella, I should’ve pushed you down the stairs with Martha!"

"Too late. If I die mysteriously now, you’re the prime suspect. Don’t worry—I’ve left a letter with someone trustworthy. If anything happens to me, it points straight to you."

"Stella! Don’t push me! Your mother’s still in the hospital. If you dare speak out of turn, I’ll make sure she—"

Slap!

The blow sent Lily staggering back.

She clutched her cheek, stunned. "You—"

Stella advanced. "Going to tattle? Go ahead. Adrian’s right outside. Let’s settle the truth about the accident once and for all."
###Chapter 30: Thickening Fog

Adrian Roland stood by the window at the end of the hospital corridor and dialed Vincent Astor's number.

"Mr. Roland," Vincent's voice came through the receiver.

"Any progress?"

"The DNA sample from the young master can't be retrieved. The hospital's sterilization was too thorough. To confirm paternity, we'd have to go to Switzerland."

Adrian's fingers tapped absently against the windowsill. The way the child had looked at him when calling him "Daddy" had inexplicably softened his heart.

"Mr. Roland, I found the boy's admission records. His appearance..."

"Go on."

"Bears a seventy percent resemblance to yours."

Silence stretched between them.

"Should we continue the DNA investigation?"

"No need." Adrian's voice was low. "Find a way to bring him back from Switzerland."

"Understood."

"Also, dig into Hugo Merovingian's relationship with Stella Valentine."

Hanging up, Adrian remained by the window, lost in thought. His tie suddenly felt suffocating. He tugged at it impatiently but couldn't loosen the knot.

"Let me help." Lily Savigny reached out.

"No." He sidestepped her, realizing only then that the tie hadn't been tied by Stella today.

Lily's eyes reddened. "This was your birthday gift from me."

Adrian paused. "Apologies. Work has been overwhelming lately."

"You act strangely every time you see Stella." Lily studied him intently. "Adrian, what's wrong with you?"

"Company matters."

"You never lied to me before."

Adrian slammed on the brakes. "Lily, you're being overly sensitive."

"It's you who's changed!" Her voice trembled. "Ever since Stella returned, you've—"

"Enough." He restarted the car. "I'll take you home first."

Lily clenched her purse strap. "You promised to spend time with me."

"Luna needs me." Adrian kept his eyes on the road. "And don't visit the hospital again."

"Why not?"

"Mrs. Laurent requires peace and quiet."

Lily bit her lip. She knew better than anyone what emotions lay hidden in Adrian's gaze when he looked at Stella.

——

In the private ward, Stella gently adjusted the blanket over Grace Laurent.

"Miss Valentine," a nurse whispered, "the stem cell transplant fees for the children remain unpaid."

At the payment counter, Stella stared at the bill, her fingers turning cold. When she swiped her card, the POS machine printed the receipt with perfect timing.

The exact amount.

She smiled bitterly. That man had calculated even this down to the cent.

9 PM, Room 1231 at Houston Grand Hotel.

"The door's unlocked." A deep voice sounded from inside.

The room was pitch black. Stella groped forward until warm hands enveloped hers.

The scent of eau de cologne lingered as the man guided her to the sofa.

"What would you like to drink?"

"Water is fine."

A chilled bottle was pressed into her palm. "Thank you," she murmured. "I'll repay the surgery fees as soon as possible."

"Unnecessary." He sat beside her. "This is a transaction."

"Will you stay tonight as well?"

"Mmm."

The man sighed suddenly. "Pity. There are no stars tonight."

"What?"

"Happy birthday, Stella Valentine."
###Chapter 31: Every Breath Takes All My Strength

Stella Valentine froze.

Birthday?

Only then did she remember—yesterday had indeed been her twenty-sixth birthday.

These days had been so fragmented, so suffocating, that merely surviving took everything she had. How could she remember such things?

"You forgot?" The man's voice carried the faint warmth of alcohol. "It's fine. I remembered."

"Mr. Alistair, have you been drinking?"

"A little."

"But the smell is strong..."

He chuckled lowly. "What, trying to scold me?"

Stella shook her head hastily. "I wouldn't dare. It's just... my father died because of drunk driving..."

The words caught in her throat.

"I just want you to be safe."

"Safe?" The man leaned deeper into the shadows, his tall frame indistinct. "Do you think I'm a good man?"

"Yes."

"Too bad. I've done too many terrible things."

"Everyone has their reasons," Stella murmured. "I believe you have yours."

A beat of silence passed before he spoke again. "I'll arrange for international specialists to examine your mother."

Her eyes burned. "Really? Thank you—"

Before she could finish, he closed the distance between them.

The heat of his breath, laced with alcohol, seared her skin, leaving her rigid.

His fingers traced her cheek, drifting lower.

"Mr. Alistair!"

She jerked her face away.

He exhaled a humorless laugh, slumping back onto the sofa. "...Still not right."

What wasn't right?

Wasn't she the one he longed for?

"Did I scare you?"

"A little."

"Don't be afraid." His voice roughened. "I'll treat you well."

Abruptly, he changed the subject. "Do you want revenge?"

Her pulse stuttered.

"Your ex-husband. The woman he's with now. The family that harmed your mother."

Did she?

Of course she did.

But what could she possibly fight them with?

Right now, even breathing required all her strength.

"Mr. Alistair, I..."

"Do you still love him?"

Love?

A bitter smile twisted her lips. "I don't even have the strength to love anymore."

"No rush." His tone was detached. "Consider it a birthday gift."

Stella lifted her head suddenly. "Have we... met before?"

The air turned to ice.

"Stella Valentine." His voice sharpened. "Don't ask questions you shouldn't."

"I'm sorry."

"Sleep."

Just like the night before.

He pressed against her back, his cologne saturating every breath.

"Stella."

"Yes?"

"Stay with me. You can have anything you want."

"I want my daughter."

"You'll have her." A pause. "Adrian is still her biological father, after all."

"But Lily will hurt her!" Her voice trembled. "She's the reason my son was born—"

His body tensed. "Your son... is his?"

"Is that relevant to our deal?"

"So that's a no." A cold laugh. "Just curious."

Stella bit her lip.

Ethan was safe with Hugo.

She prayed he'd never learn about these ugly truths.

"No," she said firmly. "He has nothing to do with Adrian."

"..."

"Mr. Alistair, please keep this secret. I just want Ethan to grow up healthy."

"What if I demand you sleep with me?"

Her fingers clenched the sheets, her entire body shaking. "...I will."

"What a devoted mother."

"Ethan isn't his." Her voice broke. "Please."

"Sleep."

"Will you keep your word?"

"That depends." His tone was indifferent. "Stay with me, and I'll consider it."

"How long?"

"Until I grow tired of you."

"Should I imitate her? Her speech? Her habits?"

He laughed abruptly. "Stella Valentine, you really are..."

"I want to do this right," she said earnestly. "What did she like?"

"Stella." His palm covered her eyes. "Sleep."
###Chapter 32: Must You Drive Me to Despair?

Sunlight filtered through the curtains when Stella Valentine finally stirred from her stupor.

A sharp pain throbbed in her chest. Her fingers groped across empty sheets.

A glass of water sat on the nightstand, weighted by a note: ["Take with water."]

Her fingers trembled against the glass. The water was perfectly lukewarm.

This man...

He'd even noticed she'd dry-swallowed her pills last night.

The sterile hospital smell hit Stella as she entered. She held her breath.

"Stella?" Grace Laurent struggled upright in bed. "Why are you here so early?"

"Missed you." Stella clasped her mother's thin hand, tracing the needle marks.

Grace swatted her wrist. "Motherhood hasn't cured your clinginess? Where's the baby?"

"The... nanny has him." Stella's throat tightened.

"Listen," Grace whispered urgently. "Breastfeeding is best. No spicy food or cold drinks..."

Stella bit her lip until it bled.

How she longed to say that child was gone.

"And avoid crab," Grace continued. "Too cooling. Seafood causes flare-ups—"

"Mom," Stella interrupted. "I know."

Grace blinked, then smiled. "My girl's grown up." She leaned closer. "Adrian visited yesterday. He still cares."

Stella's fingers twitched.

"Your father's accident..." Grace's voice broke. "We wronged him. I feared he'd take it out on you, but—"

"Mom!" Stella shot up. "Let me get you water."

Tears splashed her hands as she turned.

Her phone buzzed in the lounge.

"Where are you?" Adrian Roland's voice was arctic.

Stella squinted at the blinding sunlight. "Almost there."

The line went dead.

Grace was dabbing her eyes when Stella returned. "If only your father could see you as a mother—"

"Mom," Stella forced a smile. "I have to go."

"Is the baby crying? Hurry back!" Grace shooed her. "Skip visiting tomorrow—"

At the third traffic light, Stella dialed on impulse.

The connection startled her.

Adrian's breathing filled her ear. "More games?"

"You... unblocked me?"

"Temporary." His voice was gravelly.

Stella laughed hollowly. "Of course."

"Are you coming or not?" His volume spiked. "Morning became noon. Now evening?"

"En route."

"Excuse this time?" His sneer cut deep. "Tending your dying mother? Or too hungover from last night's escapades?"

"Adrian!" Her grip whitened on the phone. "Must you drive me to despair?"

Silence.

"Yes, I saw him." Her voice shook. "For money! Mom's hospital bills, Ethan's surgery... I was desperate!"

"Whoring for family funds?" He scoffed.

"My accounts are frozen." Her laugh was brittle. "Didn't Lily tell you? Her stepfather seized everything."

Glass shattered on his end.

"You could've asked me." His tone dropped.

"How?" She watched streets blur past. "Call? You blocked me."

After a pause, he demanded, "Who was he?"

"Does it matter?"

"Tell me!" Fury erupted.

She ended the call.

At the courthouse, she discovered crescent marks in her palms.
###Chapter 33: Who Owes Whom

"Husband?"

Stella Valentine's lips curled into a bitter smile.

Six years of marriage—had she ever truly had a husband?

She had endured the agony of childbirth alone.
She had slept on cold sheets during her postpartum recovery alone.
The echoing footsteps in their empty mansion had always been hers and hers alone.

What was the point of clinging to such a marriage?

"Mr. Roland." She deliberately switched to a formal address. "After today, we'll be strangers. You can marry your first love, and I'll walk my own path."

The steering wheel creaked under Adrian Roland's grip. "...What if I refuse to divorce you?"

"Are you insane?"

"I haven't been sane since the day of the car accident."

"Careful, Mr. Roland. That almost sounds like you still have feelings for me."

His gaze turned icy. "Don’t flatter yourself. I just don’t want my father’s murderer to walk free. Divorce? Forget it."

Stella let out a soft laugh. "Then what about Lily Savigny? Can her unborn child afford to wait?"

The air in the car froze.

"My parents' lives, Martha's life—they’re all on your hands." She stared straight ahead. "If you want revenge, bring it on. I’ll fight you to the end."

The sleek silhouette of the Maybach came into view, its license plate—88888—stinging her eyes.

Once, his favorite car had been the yellow Porsche, its plate bearing her birthday.

0826.

A date he hadn’t remembered in five years.

"We’re here." The driver handed her change. "Miss, divorce isn’t something to take lightly."

She thanked him and stepped out, only for the Maybach to roar away without warning.

The moment the call connected, Adrian’s voice was sharp with irritation. "Something came up at the company. We’ll talk another day."

"Adrian Roland!" Her grip on the phone tightened. "Are you playing games with me?"

The only response was the dial tone.

......

The Bluetooth headset slammed onto the passenger seat—only to ring again instantly.

"I said I’m busy today!" Adrian snarled.

"...Adrian?" Lily’s voice wavered with hurt.

He exhaled sharply. "What is it?"

"Next week is my mother’s birthday. Will you come with me?"

"No."

"It’s on the weekend..." Her voice grew smaller. "You promised to marry me. Does that still stand?"

His throat worked before he finally said, "I’ll have that bag you wanted shipped over."

The second the call ended, the latest-model phone shattered against the wall.

Lily’s nails dug into her palms.

That bitch Stella! Why wasn’t she dead yet? If this dragged on any longer, the truth from six years ago would—

......

A week later, Room 1231 at Houston Grand Hotel.

Stella busied herself in the kitchen, the earthy aroma of free-range chicken simmering in a clay pot.

Warm hands suddenly circled her waist.

"Mr. Alistair!" She stiffened. "My mother wanted home-cooked food, so I—"

"It smells good." His breath brushed her ear, sending a shiver down her neck.

The lights abruptly cut out.

"Sorry." His voice was startlingly clear in the dark. "I can’t let you see me yet."

She felt herself being guided to a seat. "The soup—"

"I’ll handle it." He ladled a bowl with practiced ease and set it before her. "I’m used to the dark."

The scent of chicken broth grew richer in the absence of light—like emotions deliberately buried, only growing more vivid the harder they were suppressed.
###Chapter 34: The Most Common Excuse

Darkness enveloped the room.

Stella Valentine could only hear the faint clinking of bowls and spoons from across the table.

The man skillfully ladled two bowls of chicken soup and took his seat opposite her.

The rich aroma of the soup was especially enticing in the darkness.

"First time eating completely blind?" His voice carried a hint of amusement.

Stella nodded softly. "Yes."

"It tastes wonderful," he took a sip, "feels like home."

"I learned it from the old gardener at my family home," Stella replied gently. "Her wontons were especially delicious, but I only picked up the basics."

"It's already perfect," his voice softened like water. "I love it."

"Thank you, Mr. Alistair."

"How many times is that now?"

Stella froze.

The words felt eerily familiar.

Hugo Merovingian had said the exact same thing to her before.

"Mr. Alistair..." she ventured cautiously, "have we met before?"

He didn’t answer.

In the darkness, she could only hear his steady breathing.

"Your divorce didn’t go through today?" He abruptly changed the subject.

"No," Stella’s voice dropped. "He said something urgent came up at work."

"Work," he chuckled. "The most common excuse men use."

Stella tightened her grip on the spoon. "I don’t understand... He was so eager to divorce before."

"Maybe he changed his mind."

"Why?"

"Only he knows."

Stella recalled Adrian Roland’s words on the phone.

He said he didn’t want her to be with anyone else.

How laughable.

Who would want a terminally ill single mother with lung cancer?

"How’s your mother doing?" he asked again.

"Much better." Stella instinctively started to thank him but caught herself.

He let out a quiet laugh. "Just as I thought."

"What do you mean?"

"You remind me of someone I knew," his voice grew somber. "She was just like this—gentle yet stubborn."

Stella hesitated. "Did that person... ever marry?"

"Yes."

"Then..." she chose her words carefully, "sometimes letting go is its own kind of love."

He set down his bowl. "Are you giving me advice?"

"I’m just..." Stella smiled bitterly, "speaking from experience. Holding on doesn’t mean anything."

"Like with Adrian?"

"Yes," her voice was barely audible. "If love isn’t there, you can’t force it."

A long silence followed.

"Drink your soup," was all he finally said.

Stella knew persuasion was futile.

Just as no one could convince her back then.

"Next weekend," he suddenly spoke up, "keep your schedule clear."

"Is something happening?"

"We’re going back to the Valentine estate."

Stella’s hand trembled. "What’s the point now? The Valentines are already—"

"Trust me," his voice was firm. "Every wrong done to you, I’ll make right."

......

The Valentine mansion blazed with light.

Lily Savigny handed a carefully wrapped gift to Sophia Durand. "Happy birthday, Mom."

"My sweet girl," Sophia smiled as she accepted it. "How are things with Adrian?"

Lily’s expression stiffened. "It’s... not settled yet."

"I thought once Stella—"

"She had surgery. She won’t be dying anytime soon," Lily tugged irritably at her fur stole. "And Adrian’s been acting strange lately."

Sophia narrowed her eyes. "Don’t tell me he still has feelings for—"

"I think so," Lily bit her lip. "He keeps bringing up the car accident six years ago. Like he suspects something."

Sophia’s face darkened. "Those two cars—"

"Were taken care of long ago," Lily said sharply. "Crushed to scrap. Probably melted down by now."

"Good." Sophia patted her daughter’s hand. "The main issue now is that child—"

At the mention of the child, Lily’s eyes flashed with venom. "He treats it like some treasure. Won’t even let me near it."

"Don’t worry," Sophia smirked. "I have a plan."

Outside by the pool, a tower of champagne glasses glittered under the lights.

Lily stood at the entrance, scanning the driveway.

Finally, the familiar Maybach rolled into view.

"Adrian!" She rushed forward eagerly.

The car door opened.

Adrian stepped out, his long legs unfolding.

Then the opposite door swung open—
Twilight descended as city lights began to glow.

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, watching the bustling street below. My fingers absently traced the screen of my phone.

A single unread message glowed on the display. The sender: "Mr. Lu."

"8 PM. Room 808, Imperial Heights Hotel."

Twelve simple words that made my pulse skyrocket.

After that incident three months ago, I thought my connection with Lu Chenzhou had ended. Yet here he was, reaching out first.

I took a deep breath and checked my watch—7:40 PM.

Without another thought, I grabbed my coat and rushed out.

Outside Room 808, I raised my hand to ring the bell but found the door slightly ajar.

Pushing it open, I stepped into the dimly lit suite.

Lu Chenzhou stood with his back to me at the window, his tall frame silhouetted against the neon skyline.

"Close the door." His command came without turning.

I shut it behind me, my heart pounding.

"Mr. Lu, you wanted to see—"

Before I could finish, he spun around and pinned my wrist against the wall.

"Why have you been avoiding me?" His voice was low, dangerous.

I tilted my head back to meet his gaze, breath catching.

"I haven't—"

"Liar." His free hand gripped my chin. "Three months, seven days. Three new phone numbers. Two different apartments."

My eyes widened. He'd been tracking my every move.

"Mr. Lu, that night was just a mista—"

"Mistake?" He leaned closer, his breath hot against my ear. "Then tell me why your body still remembers me."

A shiver ran through me as his fingers trailed down my neck.

"Tonight," he murmured, voice rough, "I want the truth."

Outside, lightning split the sky.

The storm was coming.
###Chapter 35: Shadows Under Starlight

Lily's fingers clenched violently.

She stared at the familiar face before her, nails digging deep into her palms.

"Lily, long time no see." Felix grinned brightly, crow's feet forming at the corners of his eyes.

Her lips curved mechanically. "Felix? What are you doing here?"

"Mr. Roland's car had a minor issue." Felix rubbed his hands together. "It's been six or seven years, hasn't it? If you hadn't swapped shifts with me back then, you wouldn't have met Mr. Roland..."

Lily's smile froze.

She glanced down at her high heels. The dark blue satin shimmered coldly under sunlight, the scattered diamonds like sharp blades stabbing her eyes.

"Beautiful shoes." Felix took a step closer. "Like stars in the night sky."

Adrian's gaze suddenly sharpened.

He stared at those shoes, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Adrian?" Lily clutched his arm, nails nearly piercing his suit. "Shall we go inside?"

Adrian didn't move.

"Are you familiar with Land Rover's braking system?" he asked abruptly.

Felix's eyes lit up. "Of course! I've repaired at least eighty Land Rovers—"

"What about a totaled, wrecked one?"

Lily's breath hitched.

She watched Felix thump his chest confidently. "I can diagnose any wreck! Just call me anytime, Mr. Roland."

Adrian handed him a business card. "Wait for my message."

Cold sweat trickled down Lily's spine.

She suddenly bent over, clutching her ankle. "These shoes... they're killing me."

Adrian frowned. "Change them when we get back."

Lily practically fled.

She burst into the bedroom, frantically tearing off the heels. The sound of ripping satin resembled an animal's scream.

"What's wrong?" Sophia entered, the golden threads on her cheongsam glittering.

Lily hurled the shoes at the wall. "Like stars! These damn shoes are like stars!"

Sophia's expression darkened.

"Adrian's investigating the accident." Lily's voice trembled. "He found Felix..."

"Calm down." Sophia picked up the shoes. "That junkyard has hundreds of wrecks. He'll never find it."

Lily stared at the golden threads on her mother's dress, watching them twist into a mocking face.

"Six years." Sophia stroked her daughter's shoulder. "Even iron would've rusted away by now. What could he possibly find?"

Outside, Adrian stood in sunlight, yet his shadow engulfed the entire room.
###Chapter 36: Who Dares Claim to Be a Rising Star Before Him?

Lily Savigny's nails dug deep into her palms.

She looked at her mother Sophia Durand with anxious eyes. "Mom, I feel like things are spiraling out of control."

Sophia grabbed her daughter's wrist. "Stay calm! The priority now is keeping Adrian Roland stable."

"But he's already suspicious!"

"So what?" Sophia sneered. "Stella Valentine won't last much longer. Once she's gone, everything will fall into place."

Lily bit her lip. "That child..."

"Must be dealt with immediately." Sophia lowered her voice. "A one-year-old is starting to talk. If he keeps crying for his mother..."

Victor Lefèvre's impatient shout came from downstairs. "Sophia! What's taking so long?"

Sophia called back before whispering a final instruction. "Remember—find out the address of the old mansion."

The grand hall buzzed with clinking glasses.

Victor waddled through the crowd, his beer belly straining against the ill-fitting tuxedo like an overstuffed penguin.

"What a fortunate man you are, Mr. Lefèvre!" someone fawned. "Such a beautiful daughter."

"Naturally." Victor puffed his chest. "My daughter is destined to marry into aristocracy."

Guests exchanged glances. "Surely not... Adrian Roland?"

"Impossible," another muttered. "Not with the feud between the Rolands and Valentines..."

Lily's smile froze as she descended the staircase.

Sophia smoothly intervened. "We parents shouldn't interfere with young love." She turned to a young man with practiced charm. "You must be the third son of the Merovingian family?"

The young man waved modestly. "Who dares claim to be a rising star in Mr. Roland's presence?"

In the corner, Adrian stood alone.

His fingers absently traced the silver banister, eyes distant.

This marked only his second visit to the Valentine estate in six years. Last time, he'd come seeking Grace Laurent only to find her gone.

Victor had transformed the entire mansion into a gaudy display of new money—gold trimmings assaulting the eyes—yet this single banister remained untouched.

Memories surfaced: Stella in her floral sundress, sliding down this very railing. Her dark hair streaming behind her like butterfly wings as she launched into his arms.

"Adrian?" Lily's voice snapped him back.

She offered a frosty glass of orange juice. "Try some?"

He set it down with a frown. "My stomach."

"Sorry, I forgot..." Lily flushed.

Adrian's gaze returned to the banister. "Those shoes suit you."

He hadn't even looked at her.

Lily forced a smile. "We'll install a banister like this in our future home, yes?"

Adrian gave no reply.

His thoughts had already drifted to the girl who once slid down banisters—now lying in a hospital bed, fighting for her life.

While he stood here, at his enemy's celebration.
###Chapter 37: A Lifetime Away

The black Cayenne glided to a stop before the Valentine family villa.

Stella Valentine sat in the passenger seat, her eyes veiled by a white silk scarf. The familiar scent of osmanthus blossoms drifted through the air from the trees lining the estate.

"Is Mr. Alistair here?"

An unfamiliar female voice answered, "He had urgent business. I'm taking you home."

Stella's fingers tightened around the seatbelt. That morning at the hotel, it had been Mr. Alistair who tied the scarf over her eyes in the darkness and guided her into the car.

"May I ask who you are?"

"Call me Miranda." The woman chuckled. "Your husband sent me."

"Can I remove the scarf now?"

"Be my guest."

Stella slowly lifted the fabric, blinking against the light. Beside her sat a sharply dressed woman with cropped hair and impeccable makeup—every inch the corporate elite.

"What a waste of such a pretty face." Miranda studied her in the rearview mirror. "Dressed like a potato sack."

Stella glanced down at her faded clothes. Since marrying Adrian Roland, she'd spent her days waiting at home. Later, consumed with saving Ethan, she'd abandoned all thought of fashion.

"It doesn't matter."

"Of course it matters!" Miranda flung open the door and signaled to another vehicle. "Let's begin!"

Several assistants suddenly swarmed the car, ushering Stella into the backseat. An array of designer garments appeared before Miranda selected a navy blue floral embroidered sundress.

"He knows you too well." Miranda's smile turned knowing. "Men always dress their women best."

"You're mistaken. We have a professional arrangement."

"Really?" Miranda arched a brow. "What employer goes to such lengths for an employee?"

Stella fell silent. These past days with Mr. Alistair left her unsettled—he resembled Hugo Merovingian yet didn't. Who could know her so intimately?

"Hurry and change. We have hair and makeup next."

Stella insisted on dressing alone. She couldn't bear anyone seeing the surgical scars across her torso.

The midnight blue velvet dress clung elegantly to her frame, its embroidered blossoms highlighting her porcelain shoulders with refined grace.

When the car door reopened, Miranda's eyes widened.

"My God..." she breathed. "No wonder he's obsessed."

Tiny diamonds twinkled like stars in Stella's upswept hair. Miranda slipped matching heels onto her feet with admiration. "Versace's latest—fewer than fifty pairs stateside."

The assistants sighed with envy. But Stella stared at her shoes in a daze—her first heels in six years.

"Miranda," she whispered, "who is Mr. Alistair?"

"You'll know when the time comes." Miranda's smile turned mysterious. "Now, let's complete this transformation."
###Chapter 38: Persistence Breaks Resistance

The Valentine mansion blazed with lights as Sophia Durand's birthday gala reached its crescendo. Crystal glasses clinked while laughter floated through the grand hall.

Victor Lefèvre guided his wife through the crowd with proprietary ease, playing the gracious host. Sophia's meticulously maintained face glowed with triumph, her smile never faltering.

"Mr. Lefèvre, your daughter and Mr. Roland make such a striking couple!" A guest gestured toward Lily Savigny and Adrian Roland conversing intimately nearby.

Sophia straightened with pride. "Adrian fell for our Lily at first sight. Pursued her relentlessly. A lady must maintain some decorum, of course."

"Persistence breaks resistance!" Victor boomed, drawing knowing chuckles from the circle.

"You'll soon control Houston's entire business scene!"

"Between the Rolands and Valentines, we'll need your patronage!"

Flushed with liquor and flattery, Victor's tongue loosened. "The wedding? Soon, very soon. Once Adrian finalizes his divorce—"

"Divorce?" The guests exchanged startled glances.

Sophia intervened hastily. "My husband's had too much to drink. Adrian has always been single—completely devoted to our Lily."

A drunken guest slurred, "But I distinctly remember Mr. Roland was married to the Valentine heiress—"

His companion clamped a hand over his mouth. "You're drunk, Lee! That gold-digger took the money and ran. Adrian despises her!"

Lee persisted. "I saw him let her sit on his shoulders to pick osmanthus blossoms. Doted on her like—"

"Ancient history!" The friend hissed. "With the Valentines ruined, that woman disappeared—"

"Who is this 'Miss Lefèvre'?"

An icy feminine voice cut through the chatter. All heads turned toward the entrance where a vision in midnight blue stood framed in the doorway, diamonds scattering light across her gown like captured starlight.

Lee rubbed his eyes. "An angel descended?"

"You're mistaken, sir." The woman glided forward. "Mr. Lefèvre's daughter doesn't share his surname."

"Preposterous!" A middle-aged man snapped.

Her lips curved. "Uncle Langley, when you couldn't find work after technical school, my father made you assistant manager. Have you forgotten your benefactor?"

The man paled. "Miss...Valentine?"

"Stella Valentine. This mansion's rightful owner." Her fingertips brushed the vandalized wall. "Such a shame to see my mother's designs defaced."

A stunned silence fell. No one expected the long-vanished Valentine heiress to materialize tonight.

Lily tugged Adrian's sleeve. "Adrian, is that—?"

But Adrian stood transfixed, his gaze locked on Stella. Lily followed his stare and gasped—the intruder wore identical celestial heels to hers.

"Stella, darling!" Sophia forced a smile. "I'm your aunt—"

"Mrs. Durand," Stella interrupted. "Hosting parties in my home without permission is rather presumptuous."

Sophia's face tightened. "After your father passed, my husband kept this family afloat—"

"How diligent of Uncle." Stella surveyed the crowd. "Now that I've returned, he can transfer control of the company today. As Father's sole heir, everything belongs to me."

Victor erupted. "How dare you speak to elders this way!"

"My mother taught me," Stella's eyes flashed, "to guard what's mine against thieves. I'll compensate Uncle's six years of 'hard work' at ten times standard wages. But Valentines remain Valentines—never Lefèvres."

The ballroom held its breath as tensions crackled between Stella and Victor's faction. Adrian remained motionless, emotions warring in his gaze.

Lily's nails dug into his arm hard enough to draw blood.
###Chapter 39: Lily Is the One I'll Protect for Life

Victor Lefèvre's face darkened instantly.

The seasoned business elites present immediately sensed the brewing family drama.

Stella Valentine had publicly humiliated Victor, showing no respect for the so-called "Shi Family CEO." The atmosphere grew tense.

"Stella," Victor suppressed his rage, adopting a paternal tone. "Let's discuss family matters privately. Don't air our dirty laundry in public."

Sophia Durand chimed in, "Yes, Stella. Your uncle searched everywhere for you. We were so worried."

"Worried?" Stella scoffed. "I was at the Roland estate. Your daughter is quite close to Mr. Roland, isn't she? Did she knowingly pursue a married man?"

Her words struck like thunder.

The guests exchanged glances. So the Shi heiress was actually Mrs. Roland?

The long-forgotten rumors of the Shi-Roland alliance resurfaced in their minds.

Victor's face turned ashen, his knuckles whitening. "Stella, must you cause chaos the moment you return?"

"Uncle, this is the Shi residence." Stella met his gaze. "Do I need permission to speak in my own home?"

"Who are you calling an outsider?!"

"Anyone who doesn't bear the Shi name."

A vein throbbed on Victor's forehead. His carefully maintained dignity was being shredded publicly.

Stella knew him too well. In their poorer days, he'd flaunted her father's cars and liquor. Now this ostentatious mansion reeked of his vanity.

Today, she would strip him bare.

"You have three days to vacate my property. Otherwise, I'll report you for trespassing."

Sophia finally dropped her act. "Stella Valentine! How dare you disown your own uncle?"

"My uncle?" Stella turned to Victor. "Did you ever treat my mother as your sister?"

"Of course!"

"Then why didn't you visit her once during her illness?"

"I...I didn't know!"

"You lived under the same roof. How could you not know?"

"Stella Valentine!" Victor bellowed. "Security! Throw her out!"

"Who dares touch me?" Her sharp command froze the guards mid-step.

As tensions peaked, a delicate voice spoke from the shadows. "If Miss Shi claims to be Mrs. Roland, let Adrian confirm it himself."

Lily Savigny gazed tearfully at Adrian Roland. "Adrian, is she really your wife?"

"That's none of your concern."

Stella turned to see Joy Fairsprene approaching gracefully.

"Joy?"

Joy stood beside her. "When we met at the hospital, I wondered why the Shi heiress needed money. Now I understand—someone's been stealing her life."

Lily paled. "And you are...?"

"Joy Fairsprene, Stella's best friend." Joy shielded Stella. "I witnessed their journey from school sweethearts to marriage. If she's not Mrs. Roland, then who is? You?"

Lily bit her lip. "...Adrian should answer that."

"Fine." Joy locked eyes with Adrian. "Mr. Roland, enlighten us."

Stella tugged her sleeve. "Joy, don't—"

"I know," Joy whispered. "But I won't stand by while someone destroys what you have."

The perfect couple?

Stella smiled bitterly. Their love had been crushed beyond recognition long ago.

"Mr. Roland," Joy pressed. "We're waiting."

All eyes turned to the silent Adrian.

Sophia interjected, "Adrian! You promised to cherish Lily! She stood by you during your darkest days. Will you betray her now?"

Tears streamed down Lily's cheeks.

Joy smirked. "Impressive acting. Did you study at Juilliard?"

"I didn't..." Lily sobbed. "Why is Miss Shi treating me this way..."

"You live in her home, steal her husband, and still play the victim?"

"Enough!" Adrian's voice cut through like a blade.

He took a deep breath, enunciating each word. "Stella and I...are divorced. Lily is the one I'll protect for life."

Joy gasped. "Mr. Roland, you—"

"Ask your dear friend," Adrian glared at Stella. "Ask what she did to my family. Lily, let's go."

He took Lily's hand and strode out, leaving stunned whispers in their wake.

The ballroom erupted.

"What just happened?"

"Did you see that?"

Victor seized the moment. "Security! Remove these troublemakers!"

"No need!" Joy grabbed Stella's arm. "This place is tainted. We're leaving!"

Stella numbly allowed herself to be led out.

Only under the osmanthus tree did Joy stop. "Stella...are you okay?"
###Chapter 40: You Did Well

She forced a faint smile. "I'm fine."

"Who are you trying to fool?" Joy Fairsprene grabbed her hand. "Why didn't you tell me the truth at the hospital? You're my best friend, yet you hide everything from me! If I'd known how much you've suffered these years, I would've rushed to help you immediately!"

Stella Valentine sighed softly. "Joy, thank you."

"Cut the formalities," Joy waved dismissively. "When I hit rock bottom, you were the one who pulled me up. Now it's my turn to help you. That woman surnamed Sun is Adrian Roland's mistress, isn't she? Just wait till I deal with her!"

"...There's no need."

"Why not?"

"Adrian and I are already divorced."

Joy froze, then murmured after a long pause, "I don't know what happened between you two, but what you said earlier was so satisfying. This is the Valentine family home—that Sun woman has no right to boss anyone around."

Stella shook her head. "Her surname isn't Sun."

"Huh?" Joy's eyes widened. "Isn't she your uncle's daughter? Wait, I remember you had a troublemaker uncle—the one your parents were always cleaning up after... Was that the greasy man earlier?"

Stella nodded. "Yes."

"Oh my god! If I'd known it was him, I would've refused to come!" Joy grimaced in disgust. "So ugly, yet his daughter is quite pretty. That Lily Savigny and her fake innocence make me sick. Of course men fall for that act."

Listening to Joy's rapid-fire complaints, Stella felt warmth in her chest.

These days, the only people she could let her guard down around were Mr. Alistair and Joy.

"Joy, having a friend like you is wonderful."

"Obviously," Joy hugged her tightly. "Stella, don't be afraid. If you need money, just tell me. Adrian is blind to fall for that scheming woman—let them have each other. I'll introduce you to someone better later."

Stella chuckled weakly. "Forget it. I'm too old."

"Nonsense! Twenty-six is a woman's prime. And you looked absolutely stunning today! That dress and shoes were perfect for you! When you walked in, half the men couldn't take their eyes off you! With your looks, suitors would line up around the world three times!"

Joy's playful teasing lightened Stella's mood.

Suddenly, a sharp pain stabbed through her abdomen.

She clutched her stomach, breaking out in cold sweat.

Joy panicked. "Stella! What's wrong?"

"Medicine... get my..."

"Okay!"

Joy frantically dug out the pill bottle, shaking one into her palm. "Take this, quick."

Stella swallowed the painkiller, her face deathly pale.

"Should I take you to the hospital?"

"No..." She gripped Joy's hand tightly. "Just... need to rest..."

"But you look terrible..."

Leaning against the wall, Stella closed her eyes and waited for the medication to take effect.

Unease crept into her heart.

This painkiller was supposed to last 24 hours—she'd taken one this morning. Why had it worn off so soon?

She'd already troubled that kind nurse last time and didn't want to owe more favors.

Twenty minutes later, the pain finally subsided.

Joy watched her worriedly. "Stella, what illness do you have? I can't even read the name on this medicine."

"Just stomach pain."

"Gastritis? My dad has that too, but never this severe."

A text notification chimed from Stella's phone.

Joy handed it over. "Who still uses SMS these days?"

Stella unlocked the screen.

[Where are you?]

It was Mr. Alistair.

[Outside the Valentine villa.]

[Stay there. Sending someone to pick you up.]

[Okay.]

[Stella, you did well.]

Warmth flooded her chest—then realization struck. [Are you at the Valentine house too?]

[Yes.]

Stella froze.

Victor Lefèvre had invited all of Houston's elite to bolster his image. With Mr. Alistair's wealth, of course he'd be among them.

But everyone at the event had shown their real faces.

Who could he be?

Had they already passed each other without knowing?

As she hesitated over how to respond, another message arrived: [Not feeling well?]

[I'm fine.]

[Wait there.]

[Okay.]

"Stella, who are you texting?" Joy asked curiously. "Why not use WhatsApp?"

"A friend."

"Male or female? Handsome? Rich?" Joy leaned in eagerly. "Preferably both—to make Adrian regret everything!"

Stella sighed.

Rich? Undoubtedly. Handsome? She truly didn't know—she'd never even seen Mr. Alistair's face.

As for Adrian... why would he regret anything?

Successful career, a beautiful wife, even taking their daughter—what more could he want?

Meanwhile, she'd thoroughly offended Victor today. Life would only get harder from here.

With her accounts frozen and her mother's medical bills unpaid, she couldn't keep relying on Mr. Alistair's help. And for her two children—though she couldn't watch them grow up, she at least needed to secure their futures.

"Joy, can you do me a favor?"

"Name it!"

"Could you... help me find a job?"

"What?"

"After crossing my uncle, finding work in Houston will be difficult. You're my only hope."

Joy thought for a moment. "Leave it to me. I'll contact you as soon as I have leads."

"Thank you."

Just then, a black Cayenne pulled up smoothly.

The efficient woman who'd done Stella's makeup earlier wasn't there—instead, a young male driver stepped out. "Miss Valentine, Mr. Alistair sent me to fetch you."

Joy immediately moved protectively in front of Stella.

"Joy," Stella hugged her, "thank you so much for today. I need to go now."

Only then did Joy relax. "This 'Mr. Alistair' is your texting friend?"

"Yes."

"Stella," Joy said seriously, "listen to me—cut ties with him immediately. You're young and beautiful. Don't get tricked by some old man."

Stella blinked. "Old man?"

"Anyone still using SMS has to be over sixty! My fifty-year-old dad uses WhatsApp better than I do!"
###Chapter 41: He Repays Her Debt

Joy Fairsprene's words sent a tremor through Stella Valentine's heart.

How should she explain her relationship with Mr. Alistair?

Employer and employee didn't quite capture it.

He treated her with the tenderness of holding something precious in his palms. He anticipated her every need, appearing precisely when she felt most helpless.

He had covered her mother's hospital bills. This meeting with her uncle was his arrangement.

And even...

Though they shared a bed each night without physical intimacy, an inexplicable closeness lingered between them.

"Miss Valentine, it's time to go," the driver reminded her.

Joy released her hand but still looked uneasy. "Stella, if you need money, I can help. Don't entertain those old men."

Stella smiled faintly. "Mr. Alistair is quite young."

"Really?" Joy eyed her skeptically.

"Yes." Stella squeezed her hand. "I'm counting on you for the job."

"Leave it to me!" Joy thumped her chest confidently. "My dad's waiting. You should go."

Stella watched the car disappear before turning away.

Her phone buzzed.

[You and Miss Fairsprene are close?]

She replied: [We've been classmates for over a decade. She's fiercely loyal.]

[Fairsprene Group's capital chain has snapped. They came today seeking funding.]

Stella's chest tightened. Joy had offended her uncle to help her—Fairsprene's financing would surely collapse now!

"Turn around!" she urged urgently.

As the driver prepared to change course, his phone rang.

"Mr. Alistair's orders," he relayed after hanging up. "He'll handle the Fairsprene matter."

Stella froze.

"He said this is repaying a debt he owes."

The suite at Houston Grand Hotel remained dimly lit.

Mr. Alistair sat at the dining table, the aroma of coffee swirling around him.

"About the Fairsprenes..." she began hesitantly.

"Worried I can't afford it?" He chuckled lightly.

Stella pressed her lips together. "It's a substantial sum. What do you want in exchange?"

"You already have it."

A sudden thought struck her. "Do you need my organs?"

Mr. Alistair burst into laughter. "Vivid imagination."

"Then why?"

"Atonement." His voice turned somber. "I wronged someone. You're the only one I can make amends to now."

When she tried to probe further, he diverted the topic. "What medication did you take today?"

She gripped her bag strap. "Just painkillers."

"Show me."

Under his piercing gaze, she reluctantly produced the bottle.

"Still hurting from the appendectomy?"

"Some tearing during childbirth," she murmured.

After a pause, he returned the bottle. "Don't overuse them."
###Chapter 42: The Mysterious Man's Identity

Stella Valentine's voice softened involuntarily when she mentioned her daughter.

Yet a pang of sorrow welled up in her eyes.

It had been a full week since she last saw the little one.

Newborns needed their mothers most. Adrian Roland wouldn't neglect the child, but what did a man know about caring for an infant?

A dull ache spread through her chest, as if an invisible hand were squeezing her heart.

"Mr. Alistair, when can I see my daughter?"

Silence lingered on the other end of the line. "Be patient."

"Can you give me a specific time?"

"Why the urgency? The child isn't going anywhere."

Stella's throat tightened.

Of course she was desperate.

The doctors had said she could leave this world at any moment.

If she died without seeing her daughter one last time, she would never close her eyes in peace.

The man exhaled deeply, his voice low. "Don't worry. You'll get your chance."

"...Alright."

At seven in the morning, Stella woke up right on time.

The other side of the bed was already cold.

She often found Mr. Alistair's behavior contradictory.

If he had to leave early every day, why not choose a place closer to stay?

Then again, this was likely part of his identity concealment tactics.

Choosing a distant meeting spot ensured she couldn't guess who he really was.

Ring—

Her phone blared abruptly.

"Stella!" Joy Fairsprene's voice trembled with panic. "Can we meet?"

Stella immediately knew something had happened to the Fairsprene family.

She swallowed a painkiller and grabbed her coat. "The usual place."

Inside the café, Joy fidgeted nervously.

"Stella!" She shot up from her seat, waving frantically.

"Trouble with the Fairsprenes?" Stella cut straight to the point. "Is it my uncle—"

"No!" Joy grabbed her hands excitedly. "Someone injected fifty million into Fairsprene Group!"

Stella's pupils contracted.

"Dad was worrying about the broken capital chain yesterday, and this morning, a mysterious donor wired the money!" Joy lowered her voice. "Who in Houston could casually throw around that kind of cash?"

Stella closed her eyes briefly.

She would never be able to repay Mr. Alistair in this lifetime.

"Stella? Do you know who it is?"

"Probably... Mr. Alistair."

Joy's eyes widened. "That man you mentioned?"

Stella gave a slight nod.

"Can I meet him? Dad wants to thank him in person."

Stella typed out a text and sent it.

Her phone vibrated instantly: 【No thanks necessary. I only intervened because of you.】

Joy peeked at the screen. "Wow, this Mr. Alistair is intense!"

"He doesn't want his identity revealed."

"Definitely a VIP!" Joy suddenly clutched Stella's hands. "Stella, he's way better than Adrian! Fifty million, just like that!"

Stella smiled bitterly. "He's kind to me for a reason."

"What reason?"

"I resemble someone he loved."

Joy's expression froze. "So you're just... a substitute?"

"You could say that."

"That's so..." Joy looked utterly scandalized. "I'll never understand the rich."

Stella squeezed her hand. "At least he helped your family."

Joy's eyes reddened. "I wanted to help you, but once again, you're the one helping me..."

"Weren't you going to introduce me to a job?"

"Yes!" Joy slapped the table. "You studied jewelry design, right? I know—"

Stella interrupted. "I never graduated. Only have a high school diploma."

Joy froze. "Because of Adrian?"

Stella's gaze darkened.

At twenty, her world had turned upside down.

Her father died. The family assets were seized. She gave birth to Ethan alone overseas, only to return and see Adrian holding Lily Savigny...

By the time she woke from that nightmare, the late-stage lung cancer diagnosis was already on the table.
###Chapter 43: I'll Come to You When the Time Is Right

"Damn jinx!" Joy Fairsprene pinched her own arm hard, her gaze locked on the scene ahead.

Stella Valentine followed her line of sight. Lily Savigny was practically draped over Adrian Roland. The woman cooed something, and Adrian immediately knelt to examine her ankle with practiced ease.

Lily deliberately stomped her foot, drawing an indulgent smile from Adrian as they entered a jewelry store arm in arm.

"Why are they going to a jewelry store?" Joy's eyes widened. "Are they really getting married?"

Stella withdrew her gaze, voice calm. "It was always inevitable."

If not for her six-year absence, Lily would've been Mrs. Roland long ago.

"Let's go in." Joy yanked Stella forward.

The sudden movement sent a sharp pain through Stella's healing wound. She gasped. "Joy, don't—"

But Joy was determined. "You saved my father's business. Today, I'm treating you."

"I don't want to see them..."

"Stop hiding!" Joy gritted her teeth. "The more you avoid them, the bolder they get. Today, I'll expose that fake lily's true colors!"

The jewelry store's glass door swung open under Joy's forceful push.

A sales associate greeted them with a polished smile. "What may I show you ladies today?"

"The most expensive piece you have!" Joy slapped the counter. "And I mean the priciest!"

The associate hesitated. "Our most exclusive item is a new couple's ring set..."

"What, single women can't buy rings?" Joy scoffed.

The commotion caught Adrian's attention. His expression darkened. "Following me now?"

Joy rolled her eyes. "Mr. Roland, do you own the streets?"

"Of all jewelry stores in Houston, you chose this one?" His eyes turned stormy.

"Because I can!" Joy planted her hands on her hips. "Unless you plan to buy out the entire store?"

As tensions escalated, Stella tugged her friend's sleeve. "Joy, let it go."

"Why should we?" Joy raised her voice. "Adrian Roland, if you hate the Valentines so much, why marry their niece? Stop pretending to be noble!"

Adrian's face hardened. "My personal affairs are none of your concern."

"Who cares about you?" Joy turned to the associate. "Where's that ring?"

The associate presented a navy velvet box. "This limited edition couple's set is designed by our head jeweler."

The modest diamonds carried an eye-watering price tag.

Joy paled slightly while counting the zeros.

Lily sighed dreamily. "So beautiful..."

"If you like it, we'll take it," Adrian said flatly.

"But Ms. Valentine saw it first..."

Joy whispered to Stella, "I might be short on funds..."

Stella pushed the box away. "We're not interested."

The associate immediately turned to Adrian with a sycophantic smile. "Mr. Roland, this set makes perfect wedding bands."

"Wedding bands?" Lily blushed. "I'm not Mrs. Roland yet."

"Soon enough." The associate glanced meaningfully at Adrian.

Lily leaned against him. "Is that true, Mr. Roland?"

After a pause, Adrian said, "Get our sizes measured."

The associate beamed, scurrying to assist them.

Joy stomped her foot in frustration. "Stella, let's buy something else!"

Just then, Stella's phone vibrated.

[Bank account unfrozen. $5,000,000 deposited.]

Followed by:
[Buy it.]

Her head snapped up, scanning the crowded street for a familiar figure.

[Don't look. We'll meet when the time comes.]

Her fingers trembled as she replied: [This is too much. I don't need—]

[You do.]
[Wear it for me.]

Joy rushed outside. "Stella, what's wrong?"

"Nothing." Stella pocketed her phone, resolve hardening. "Let's go back for that ring."

She pulled Joy toward the store, slamming a black card onto the counter under Adrian's stunned gaze.
###Chapter 44: Adrian, You're Blind!

Joy Fairsprene barely had time to react before Stella Valentine dragged her back into the jewelry store.

"I'll take this pair." Stella pointed at the couple rings in the display case, her voice crisp.

The sales associate hesitated. "But Mr. Roland is currently—"

"Charge it." Stella slid her credit card across the counter.

The POS machine chirped as it printed the receipt. A faint smile touched Stella's lips. How long had it been since she last spent money without restraint?

Lily Savigny abruptly stood up. "Surely Miss Valentine isn't using a bad check?"

"How did you know my accounts were frozen?" Stella's gaze turned razor-sharp.

Lily paled. "I—"

"Did my uncle tell you?" Stella advanced step by step.

"Yes!" Lily lifted her chin. "Dad told me."

"Your dad?"

"My mother married him. Is it wrong to call him Dad?"

Stella's laugh was icy. "Then will you repay his debts for him?"

Lily blurted out, "My father would never—"

Crack!

The slap echoed through the boutique.

"That was for my son." Stella's voice could freeze hell.

Crack!

Another stinging blow landed.

"And that was for my mother."

The salesgirl rushed forward. "This is Mrs. Roland—"

Joy snorted. "Future Mrs. Roland? Isn't it too early to suck up?"

Adrian Roland shielded Lily behind him. "Stella! Have you lost your mind?"

"You're the insane one!" Stella's eyes burned red. "Your son almost died, and you're here buying rings for his would-be murderer!"

"I'll investigate—"

"Investigate?" Stella's bitter laugh shattered. "Adrian, you're blind!"

She wiped her tears. "Let's get divorced."

Adrian's expression darkened. "I don't have time."

"No time?" Joy mocked. "Time for ring shopping but not divorce papers?"

Lily suddenly clutched Adrian's arm. "You're having second thoughts, aren't you?"

"Lily—"

"All of Houston knows we're getting married!" Lily shrieked. "If you back out now, how can I show my face?"

Joy interjected, "Miss Savigny, have we met before? At a hospital perhaps?"

Lily went sheet-white. "What nonsense—"

"Seven years ago. Obstetrics ward." Joy enunciated each word. "The girl who'd had so many abortions she could never conceive again—that was you, wasn't it?"

"You're lying!"

"Shall we check the medical records?" Joy's smile was lethal. "The doctors used you as a cautionary tale when counseling me."

Silence swallowed the boutique.

Adrian's gaze turned unrecognizable.
###Chapter 45: Because I Know You

Lily Savigny clutched Adrian Roland's sleeve desperately, tears welling in her eyes. "Adrian, are you just going to stand there and let her slander me like this?"

Joy Fairsprene let out a cold laugh, stepping closer. "Miss Savigny, if you're truly innocent, why refuse to check the medical records at the hospital?"

"Enough!" Adrian's voice cut through the tension like a blade.

Joy stomped her foot in frustration. "Adrian, you used to be so sharp. How did this fake, scheming woman manage to fool you? A simple hospital visit would clear everything up!"

Adrian's jaw tightened. After a long silence, he finally spoke. "I believe her."

"You believe her?" Joy's eyes widened in disbelief. "Have you lost your mind?"

His gaze turned icy. "Miss Fairsprene, out of respect for our families' friendship, I'll let this go today. But my patience has limits."

"I'm the one going too far? When she's the one who—"

"Joy," Stella Valentine gently pulled her back. "Stop. This is getting ugly."

Only then did Joy notice the heavy silence in the jewelry store. The staff huddled in corners, too afraid to speak, while curious onlookers gathered outside.

She scoffed. "Fine. I'll back off for Stella's sake. Miss Savigny, you'd better watch yourself. Adrian, don't come crying to me when she can't give you children!"

Joy grabbed Stella's hand and stormed out, not stopping until they were sure no one followed.

"I can't believe this!" She kicked the ground angrily. "Since when did Adrian become so blind?"

Stella gave a bitter smile. "Who knows?"

"Forget him! Come on, I'm taking you to meet some friends. Guaranteed to cheer you up!"

Before Stella could refuse, Joy shoved her into the car. "Stella, you've been trapped in that miserable marriage for years. It's time to let loose."

As the scenery blurred past the window, Stella smoothed her wind-tossed hair.

Six years. Six long years confined in that cold mansion. Cooking elaborate meals only to throw them away at midnight.

With so little time left, why not indulge for once?

She pulled out her phone and texted Mr. Alistair: [Taking the day off today.]

[Alright. Stay safe.]

[You know where I am?]

[Yes.]

Her pulse quickened. [Are you following me?]

[No.]

[Then how do you know?]

[Because I know you. And I know Joy.]

She glanced at Joy, who was animatedly chatting on the phone, her face full of life.

Another message came through: [Have fun. Call me when you're done.]

Those simple words carried warmth, reminding her of his low, tender voice—like a whisper in her ear.

"Stella, we're shopping first! That ring deserves a killer outfit!"

Stella hesitated. "That's not necessary..."

"Absolutely necessary! Today, you're going to stun everyone!"

Joy dragged her into a boutique, determined to pick the perfect dress.

Stella chose a navy blue dress with a delicate silver belt that accentuated her slender waist, making her skin glow like porcelain.

"You have excellent taste!" The salesgirl gasped. "This looks incredible on you!"

Stella barely recognized herself in the mirror. After six years without shopping, the once-avid fashionista had nearly forgotten this feeling.

"This floral sundress would also look lovely..." The clerk held up another option.

Stella's smile faltered. "No, thank you. Just this one."

Joy paid without hesitation, then whisked her off for makeup. "Just light touches. You're stunning with minimal makeup."

Confused but compliant, Stella let them soften her pallid complexion.

Joy brought her to a board game café where a group of young people were laughing over a game.

"Ahem!" Joy cleared her throat dramatically. "The queen has arrived. Where's my welcome party?"

The guys didn't even look up. "Find a seat. Where's the beauty you promised?"

Joy yanked one boy's ear. "Open your damn eyes!"

Wincing in pain, the guy froze when he saw Stella. "Holy..."
###Chapter 46: Starlight Brilliance

Joy Fairsprene lifted her chin triumphantly. "See? I wasn't lying."

Zachary Ellison froze, hastily wiping his palms on his pants before extending a hand. "Hi, I'm Zachary."

Stella Valentine gave a polite, brief handshake. "Stella Valentine."

"That's such a beautiful name!"

Joy crossed her arms and shook her head. "Zachary, you were so cocky on the phone earlier. What happened to all that bravado?"

His ears turned red as he fidgeted. "You just said you were bringing a pretty friend. You didn't mention she was... this level of stunning. And you usually hang out with us rough guys—how was I supposed to guess—"

Joy stomped her foot. "Do you believe me now?"

"Yes, yes!" Zachary's eyes sparkled. "Miss Valentine, are you a celebrity?"

"No."

"Then..."

"I'm currently between jobs."

He jumped in eagerly. "So you're in grad school? You look like you're barely twenty."

Stella chuckled. "I'm actually twenty-six."

"No way!" His eyes widened. "You and Joy were classmates?"

Joy lunged at him. "Zachary, what are you implying?"

"Wait, wait!" He dodged, laughing. "Normally I'd be mad you're hitting me, but since you brought such a gorgeous friend, I'll let it slide!"

The commotion drew attention from the gaming area. A red-haired guy slung an arm around Zachary's neck. "Yo, new girlfriend? This one's way hotter than that plastic-surgery disaster from last time."

Zachary bristled. "Shut up!"

Others crowded around, teasing and catcalling.

Joy stepped protectively in front of Stella. "Back off. My friend isn't feeling well."

Zachary immediately fretted. "What's wrong? I know some specialists abroad—"

"No need," Stella said with a faint smile. "The medical care here is excellent."

Laughter erupted around them. "Ouch, Zachary. Shot down hard."

Flushing, Zachary changed the subject. "Are we playing or what? Let's hit the pool tables!"

On the way, Zachary was excessively attentive—offering drinks, adjusting the temperature.

Joy rolled her eyes. "Zachary, dial it back a notch."

He grinned unapologetically. "A gentleman must pursue a graceful lady."

At the pool tables, they split into teams.

Zachary puffed out his chest. "Stella, just sit back and watch. I can take them all by myself."

Joy scoffed. "Yeah, right."

Stella spoke softly. "How about I break first?"

Zachary waved a hand. "Go for it. I've got your back."

She picked up a cue, expertly chalked the tip. Leaning low over the table, her gaze sharpened.

A crisp crack—the balls scattered, four sinking simultaneously.

The room fell silent.

Over the next ten minutes, Stella cleared the table with fluid precision. When the final black eight ball dropped, Zachary's jaw still hung open.

"Sorry, I'm a bit rusty," she said, setting down the cue.

"R-rusty?" he stammered.

Joy doubled over laughing. "Zachary, you just tried to show off in front of a master!"

"Miss Valentine," Zachary gaped, "you could go pro. Who taught you?"

Stella's expression dimmed. "...My ex-husband."

Memories surged—college days when Adrian Roland would take her to pool halls, later teaching her himself. She'd learned quickly, soon matching him shot for shot. Back then, he'd get jealous if she even spoke to a waiter, always pulling her into shadowed corners to—

"Excuse me," a staff member interrupted. "This area's been reserved."

Zachary scowled. "We're not done yet."

The door swung open.

A tall figure stepped inside.

When their eyes met, the air turned to ice.
###Chapter 47: The Ex-Husband and the Suitor

Adrian Roland never expected to encounter Stella Valentine here.

He had originally come to accompany Lily Savigny in selecting an engagement ring. Ever since Luna was born, Lily had intensified her pressure for marriage, driving him to distraction.

After dropping her off, he immediately escaped.

Strangely, the man who once swore never to see Stella again now found himself thinking of her constantly. Perhaps it was because of Luna—or perhaps it was the lingering questions about that car accident.

"Adrian, we agreed this was a guys' night. Why did you bring little Stella along?"

The speaker was Lucas Sherwood, his college roommate. A group of old friends had gathered at the pool hall to catch up—none had anticipated Stella's appearance.

Lucas greeted her warmly. "Look how grown-up little Stella is! Last time I saw you, you were still in college."

Stella nodded politely. "Hello, Lucas."

"Adrian should've at least picked you up," Lucas teased.

Adrian frowned. "Cut the nonsense."

"So, are you two married now?" another classmate chimed in.

Stella replied calmly, "We're already divorced."

The air froze instantly.

Lucas gaped. "What? But you two were—"

"Let's not dwell on the past." Stella turned to Joy Fairsprene. "Let's go."

Joy whispered, "Just like that?"

"Yes. I need to visit my mother at the hospital."

Zachary Ellison remained rooted in place, suddenly speaking up. "Mr. Roland, care for a game?"

Everyone stiffened.

Adrian studied the unfamiliar man coldly. "Reason?"

"I'm pursuing Ms. Valentine." Zachary gestured toward Stella. "I heard she learned pool from you. Thought I'd see how good her teacher really is."

Joy scoffed. "Watch your mouth. What's wrong with being divorced?"

"Exactly!" Zachary snapped, an unusual edge in his voice.

Stella tugged his sleeve. "Let's go play board games."

"Sure." As Zachary turned to leave, Adrian's voice stopped him.

Gripping his cue, Adrian smirked. "Since Mr. Ellison insists, one game it is."

His burning gaze locked onto Stella. "What's wrong? Afraid to play? I did teach you every trick you know."

Stella smiled faintly. "And if I win?"

Tension crackled through the pool hall. The hostility between the two men thickened, while Stella stood between them, utterly composed.

The girl who once chased after Adrian Roland was long gone.
###Chapter 48: Adrian, How Dare You?!

The call connected instantly.

Adrian's voice came through the receiver: "What does Miss Valentine want?"

"I want my daughter back." Stella's voice trembled slightly. "That child cost me nearly my life. With so many women around you, Mr. Roland, why must you take her from me?"

"Never." Adrian's tone was icy. "My flesh and blood will not be raised elsewhere."

"What if... she's not yours?"

The pool cue creaked under Adrian's tightening grip. "Say that again."

Stella chuckled darkly. "Since Mr. Roland already has a new lover and even picked out wedding rings, you'll have your own children soon enough. My daughter isn't even a month old. She needs her mother."

Her words exploded like a bomb, draining color from every face in the room.

"Stella, you have a daughter?" Joy gasped, eyes wide.

Stella ignored her, glaring at Adrian. "Care to make a bet?"

His jaw clenched in silence.

"What's wrong? Is the mighty Adrian Roland actually scared?"

"Children aren't bargaining chips." Adrian finally spoke. "Out of respect for giving birth to Luna, I'll let you see her if you win. But taking her? Impossible."

"How dare you!" Stella's voice cracked. "I almost died delivering her! What right do you have to steal my daughter? Adrian Roland, how dare you?!"

The outburst tore at her surgical wounds. Pain crashed over her like tidal waves. She clutched her abdomen as cold sweat soaked through her blouse.

"Stella!" Joy frantically searched for medication. "Take your pills!"

The bitter tablets slid down her throat but couldn't quell the agony. Her legs buckled.

"What's wrong with you?" Adrian suddenly stood before her, brows furrowed.

Stella laughed bitterly, her face ghostly pale. "None of your business."

"Tell me!" His voice simmered with restrained fury.

Joy shoved him away. "Adrian Roland! You cheated while Stella was pregnant, divorced her right after childbirth, and now you're ring shopping with your mistress? Are you even human?"

"It's not what you think." Adrian's expression darkened.

"The evidence speaks for itself!" Joy trembled with rage. "Stella, we'll sue! We'll get Luna back!"

Adrian sneered. "With what? Her job? Income? Or the ability to provide the best education?"

"Better than leaving her with a monster like you!"

The painkillers finally took effect. Stella counted the remaining pills with shaking hands—only a few left. The bottle was nearly empty after mere days.

"Fine." She forced herself upright. "If I win, I see Luna today. We'll settle custody later."

She grabbed a pool cue, knuckles whitening.

"Stella, don't push yourself..." Joy fretted.

"I can do this." Determination hardened Stella's gaze. If she could endure cancer pain, this was nothing.

"Mr. Roland, who breaks?"

Adrian studied her, his expression unreadable. "Ladies first."

"Thank you."

One shot, two shots... Colored balls disappeared into pockets until only two remained.

Stella adjusted her stance, aiming at an impossible angle.

"Stella, that's the wrong direction!" Joy stomped in frustration.

Zachary explained, "Miss Valentine's attempting a bank shot to sink both."

"That's too risky..."

Lucas stepped forward, gripping her wrist. "Little Star, one more ball and you win. Why gamble?"

Stella met his gaze. "Lucas, you're his friend."

"I didn't know you two were..." Lucas looked sick.

"Ancient history." She pulled free. "I just want my daughter."

The cue struck. The white ball carved a perfect arc.

Clack—the first ball dropped.

The rebounding white ball kissed the final colored sphere.

Clack—silence.

Stella set down her cue. "Mr. Roland, I've won."

Adrian's eyes darkened.

"I'm seeing Luna today." Each word was deliberate.

"Not today."

"Going back on your word?" Her voice shook.

"I promised a visit, not a timeline." His smirk chilled the room. "I have plans tonight. Another time."

A sharp slap echoed through the billiard room.

Stella's palm burned. "You're toying with me?!"

Adrian touched his stinging cheek, smile turning cruel. "You played me first about Luna. We're even."

"I needed Luna to save—"

"Save that bastard child!" Adrian roared. "You married me just to use our baby's cord blood for your illegitimate son! Stella Valentine, what am I to you? A tool? Six years ago you schemed for the Roland fortune, and now history repeats!"

"If I wanted the Roland fortune, why was I borrowing money for my mother's treatment?"

Tears darkened the carpet. Stella's laugh was hollow. He was brilliant—yet chose willful blindness.

"Borrowing?" Adrian's eyes narrowed. "At the jewelry store today, Joy couldn't afford those $300,000 rings. Who swooped in last minute?"
###Chapter 49: Leave It to Me

Stella Valentine's fingers trembled slightly.

The matching couple's rings worth three million were indeed purchased with Mr. Alistair's card.

Adrian Roland's gaze was sharp as a blade. "Three million is no small sum. The Valentine family went bankrupt long ago. Where did you get the money?"

Stella's heart ached as if pricked by needles.

The Valentine family?

Now it belonged to Victor Lefèvre and Sophia Durand—it was Lily Savigny's family home!

After her father's death, she and her mother had been driven out, stripped of their last refuge.

She opened her mouth but remained silent in the end.

Explanations?

Hadn't she given enough over the past six years? Each attempt only brought deeper humiliation.

Besides, she couldn't drag Mr. Alistair into this.

"What, nothing to say?" Adrian sneered.

Stella took a deep breath. "Does what I say even matter?"

"Still going to see our daughter?"

"Of course!"

Joy Fairsprene grabbed Stella's arm. "Stella, ride with me."

Adrian raised an eyebrow. "Ms. Fairsprene, afraid I'll devour her?"

"I'm afraid she'll catch bad luck just by being near you," Joy shot back without hesitation.

In the underground parking lot, Zachary Ellison tried to follow but was stopped by Lucas Sherwood. "Let them handle it themselves."

As they left, whispers floated through the air. "They actually divorced? And Adrian cheated?"

Lucas started the car. "Fate works in mysterious ways."

After the incident six years ago, Adrian had become a different person. When he reappeared, he was already a rising star in Houston's business world.

No one knew what had happened during those missing years.

Dusk deepened.

Adrian drove a discreet Lexus today, clearly avoiding attention.

Joy gripped the steering wheel. "Stella, is your stomachache from not recovering properly after childbirth?"

Stella gazed out the window. "Maybe."

"Don't worry. I'll make sure you get your daughter back."

"No, I can't drag you into this. Adrian's methods..."

Joy fell silent.

Adrian drove slowly, taking over an hour before stopping at an old colonial-style house.

The paint was peeling, but warm light glowed from the windows.

Her phone vibrated.

[Don't worry. I'll find a way. Don't force it—leave it to me.]

Mr. Alistair's text warmed Stella's heart.

With him by her side, Luna would surely return to her!

"Stella, he's going inside!"

Stella rushed out of the car and followed.

The sound of a baby's cooing reached her ears.

Her heart clenched.

"Where is she?" She charged into the house, searching frantically.

Adrian followed leisurely. "She's my daughter too."

"No, she's not!"

"The DNA results were clear."

The elderly butler, Benjamin Langley, emerged carrying the baby, smiling kindly. "Young master brought little Luna home! I always said no mother could forget her child..."

Stella nearly lunged forward.

In the pink swaddle, little Luna's grape-like eyes sparkled. Seeing Stella, she suddenly giggled, tiny hands waving in the air.

"Let me hold her..."

The moment Luna was in her arms, Stella's tears nearly spilled over.

So small. So light.

The nurse had said Luna weighed only four pounds at birth due to malnutrition during pregnancy.

The butler chuckled. "Little Luna is so lively, just like the young master was as a child! But she looks like her mother—she'll grow into a beauty..."

Stella's voice trembled. "Her mischievousness comes from me."

"Had a little quarrel?" The butler beamed. "Young master, you should be more accommodating. Little Stella is still recovering..."

Adrian stood in the shadows, watching silently.

Stella had grown thinner, her arms worryingly slender as she cradled their daughter. Yet she held the baby steadily, her gaze tender enough to melt hearts.

He had imagined this scene countless times.

Stella holding their child, humming a lullaby.

Now, the dream had become reality.

In the cruelest way possible.
###Chapter 50: Unresolved Heartache

A baby's cry pierced the silence.

Adrian Roland snapped back to reality, scrambling to his feet. "Is Luna hungry? I'll prepare formula."

Old butler Benjamin Langley stopped him. "Master Adrian, the child's mother is right here. Why use formula?"

Stella Valentine's back visibly stiffened.

Adrian froze.

"Miss Stella, this way please." Benjamin guided her toward the bedroom.

After a brief hesitation, Stella followed, unable to resist her maternal instincts.

The door clicked shut.

Joy Fairsprene burst into the living room, scanning the area. "Adrian Roland! Where's Stella?"

Adrian's expression darkened. "She's fine."

"Fine my ass!" Joy glared. "You even stole her child! What won't you do?"

"Luna is my daughter!"

"Oh, now you acknowledge her?" Joy sneered. "Where were you when Stella was pregnant? When she carried your child alone?"

Adrian fell silent.

"Playing devoted father now?" Joy advanced. "Besides donating sperm, what have you actually done?"

"I'll make it right."

"How?" Joy mocked. "By finding her a stepmother?"

"Joy Fairsprene!" Adrian roared. "You're not welcome here."

"I'm not leaving." She crossed her arms. "Not until Stella walks out safely."

Adrian suddenly asked, "Where is she staying now?"

"None of your business!" Joy rolled her eyes. "Can't even track your own wife's whereabouts?"

"..."

"But someone better than you is taking care of her," Joy deliberately added.

Adrian's pupils contracted. "Who? That bastard's father?"

"Watch your mouth!" Joy snapped. "He's handsome, wealthy, and treats Stella like a queen. Didn't blink before wiring millions for those diamond rings today."

"He bought the rings?"

"Obviously!" Joy scoffed. "The Valentines froze all her assets. She couldn't even afford her mother's medical bills. If I hadn't met her at the hospital—"

A sharp pain stabbed Adrian's chest.

She'd fallen that far?

Yet at the Valentines', she'd appeared so polished...

Joy continued, "Your mistress has quite the medical history too. Check her hospital records."

"What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said." Joy smirked. "She'll never be a mother. Too many abortions ruined her uterus."

"Lies!" Adrian retorted. "She carried my child until Stella—"

"You believe that?" Joy cut in. "Nobody loves children more than Stella."

The bedroom door opened.

Stella emerged with sleeping Luna in her arms.

"Shh—" She whispered. "Just fell asleep."

Joy peeked at the baby. "She's gorgeous! Got both your best features."

Stella smiled tenderly. "Weighed only four pounds at birth. Now she's heavy and always hungry."

"I'm claiming godmother rights!" Joy beamed.

Stella instinctively glanced at Adrian, remaining silent.

Benjamin brought out steaming wontons. "Miss Stella, stay for supper? Martha's recipe."

At Martha's name, Stella's nose tingled. "No, Joy will take me home."

She kissed Luna's cheek lingeringly.

"Be good, sweetheart. Mommy will come for you soon."

Handing the baby to Benjamin, she stated firmly, "I'll return for Luna shortly."

"Where to?" Benjamin asked.

"The city," Adrian interjected. "It's early."

"Won't be long." Stella's voice held steel. "I'll fight for custody."

She grabbed Joy's arm and strode out.

Dared not look back.

Afraid one glance would shatter her resolve.

Benjamin fretted. "Master Adrian, shouldn't you—"

Adrian collapsed onto the sofa, arm over his eyes. "What's the point..."

"What really happened between you two?"

"Benjamin."

"Yes?"

"I can't forgive what happened to my parents."

Benjamin sighed. "The police ruled it an accident. Why blame Miss Stella?"

"But she lied!" Adrian's voice cracked. "Disappeared the moment the Rolands fell..."

Benjamin suddenly recalled something. "That day, a young woman from the 4S shop came for car maintenance..."

Adrian bolted upright. "What did you say?"
###Chapter 51: Lies and Betrayal

12:03 AM.

Lily Savigny irritably clicked the remote, the TV screen flickering between late-night infomercials and melodramatic soap operas. The noise only deepened her agitation.

Adrian Roland had vanished after dropping her off earlier.

His private line went unanswered. The company receptionist claimed he never showed up at work.

She gnawed at her nails, her gaze darkening as she stared at her phone. Had he gone to see that little bastard again?

What unsettled her most was running into Stella Valentine at the jewelry store today. Not only was that woman still alive, but she'd also borne Adrian a child.

She dialed his number again. The robotic voice informed her his phone was still off.

Beep—

The sound of the electronic lock disengaging made her head snap up.

"Adrian!" She rushed toward the door. "Where have you been? Your phone's been off all night. I was worried sick."

Exhausted, he bent to remove his shoes without looking at her. "Battery died."

"Liar!" Her lips pursed. "I called your office. They said you weren't there."

His expression darkened instantly. "You're tracking me?"

"I—I just missed you." She reached for his tie. "Darling..."

"Don't call me that." He sidestepped her touch. "We're not married."

Her face stiffened.

She leaned in to sniff his shoulder. "Let me check—"

"Enough!" He shoved her away sharply. "I'm tired."

"You're yelling at me?" Her eyes reddened instantly. "Guilty conscience? Seeing someone else?"

He massaged his temples wearily. "Stop being unreasonable."

"Unreasonable?" Her voice rose. "My fiancé disappears for a whole day, and I can't even ask questions?"

He stood and grabbed his car keys.

"You're leaving?" She blocked his path. "I knew it! Adrian, I've given you six years!"

Adrian closed his eyes briefly. "Lily, is what Joy said true?"

Her face drained of color.

"Did you have an abortion? Are you infertile?"

"She's lying!" Lily shrieked. "Stella caused my miscarriage!"

He held her gaze. "Tell me it's not true, and I'll believe you."

"...I didn't lie."

"Lily," his voice turned gravelly, "I despise liars most of all."

Her eyes darted away. "...Of course it's not true."

After a long silence, Adrian gave a faint nod.

She wrapped her arms around him from behind. "Are you worried I can't give you children? We can try... I'll treat Luna as my own..."

Her fingers began undoing his shirt buttons.

Adrian jerked awake, fastening them again. "Business emergency. I need to go."

Once outside, he slumped into his car and lit a cigarette.

His phone screen illuminated with Vincent's investigative report: Lily had indeed undergone an abortion. Though hospital records were erased, pharmacy purchases couldn't be falsified.

Through the smoke, he recalled the silhouette he'd seen at the old house today—Stella holding Luna.

That tiny, always-smiling daughter.

The cigarette burned his fingers, but he felt nothing.
###Chapter 52: Whirlpool of Truth and Conspiracy

The moment Adrian Roland left, Lily Savigny's trembling fingers dialed her mother's number.

"Mom, something's wrong..." Her voice trembled with panic. "Adrian seems suspicious..."

Sophia Durand, woken in the dead of night, glanced at the sleeping Victor Lefèvre before tiptoeing to the balcony.

"What's he suspecting? The car accident or that maid incident?"

"Neither." Lily bit her nails. "It's Joy Fairsprene. She saw me... at the hospital seven years ago..."

"What?!" Sophia's voice rose sharply.

Lily dug her nails into her palm. "That bitch actually remembers me! Adrian warned me today not to lie to him. I'm losing my mind..."

"Calm down!" Sophia lit a cigarette. "The hospital records were destroyed long ago. What can she prove with just words?"

"But my fake pregnancy..." Lily's voice cracked. "Adrian keeps visiting the old mansion just for that little bastard..."

Exhaling smoke, Sophia narrowed her eyes. "Get rid of the child first. Did you get the old mansion's address?"

"Not yet..."

"Useless!" Sophia snapped. "Stella is the birth mother. We have to act before she does! Once you're married, half the Roland fortune will be yours!"

Lily fell silent for a moment. "What should I do?"

"Ignore him for a few days, then bring lunch to his office." Sophia blew a smoke ring. "Men are all the same—they only want what they can't have."

After hanging up, Sophia dispersed the smoke scent before returning to the bedroom.

"What's all the noise?" Victor grumbled, turning over.

"Just a nightmare..." Sophia softened her voice. "I dreamed Stella was trying to kill me..."

"She wouldn't dare!" Victor sat up abruptly. "How audacious!"

Sophia nestled against him. "With you here, I feel safe."

Stella Valentine stood outside the hotel room door, knocking until her knuckles turned red. No answer.

A passing attendant offered, "Shall I contact the guest for you?"

Glancing at the time—1 AM—she hesitated over disturbing Mr. Alistair.

Her phone vibrated.

[Use your fingerprint. Right index finger.]

The lock clicked open. The attendant smiled. "You could open it all along."

"This fingerprint..." Stella stared at her finger. "When was it registered?"

[Mr. Alistair, how do you have my fingerprint?]

[We'll talk when you're back.]

The suite was in disarray. A shirt draped carelessly over the sofa, documents scattered across the coffee table. She tidied silently before turning off the lights to wait.

When the lock sounded again, footsteps echoed sharply in the dark.

"Did you have fun today?" Mr. Alistair's voice held amusement. "You made quite a scene."

Stella clenched her fists. "Zachary is just a friend..."

"Stella." He stepped closer abruptly. "When men are kind to women, there's always an agenda."

"And you?" She met his shadowed gaze. "Is it nostalgia for the past, or...?"

"Both." He changed the subject. "Did you see your daughter?"

"Yes." Her voice was barely a whisper. "Getting custody won't be easy, will it?"

"Adrian won't relinquish her easily." He settled onto the sofa. "It'll take time."

"Mr. Alistair... can I work during the day?" Stella asked suddenly. "I need to prove I can support my child."

Silence engulfed the room. Only their breaths intertwined in the darkness.
###Chapter 53: Stella, Let's Have a Baby

Stella Valentine had spent countless nights agonizing over custody of her daughter.

Though her cancer surgery was successful, the shadow of recurrence loomed over her. She didn't know how long she had left—three years, maybe five.

Logically, she shouldn’t fight for custody. But the thought of her mother losing both her husband and granddaughter was unbearable.

Luna was her mother’s reason to keep living.

More importantly, she could never entrust her daughter to Lily Savigny. That woman was ruthless—she’d even orchestrated Ethan’s sepsis. What wouldn’t she do?

Adrian Roland adored their daughter, but he trusted Lily blindly. He’d ignored Joy Fairsprene’s eyewitness account of the abortion.

As a mother, Stella had to protect her child.

"Stella."

Mr. Alistair’s voice pulled her back to reality. He sat in the shadows of the sofa, his tall frame barely visible.

"Remember, I’ll help you secure custody, but we must wait for the right moment. Acting rashly will backfire."

She nodded softly. "I understand."

"Come sit." He patted the space beside him.

The custom sofa was over two meters long. She perched at the far end, keeping her distance.

The faint scent of his cologne drifted toward her.

"Stella, what kind of man do you like?" he asked abruptly.

She blinked. "Kind. Loyal. Responsible."

"That’s all?"

"Most men can’t even meet those standards."

He chuckled. "Your expectations are low."

"They were higher when I was young." She smiled wryly. "Tall, handsome, athletic, top grades..."

Back then, she’d been the untouchable heiress of the Valentine family, dismissing every suitor—until Adrian appeared.

She hadn’t accepted him out of love, but because she believed only he was worthy of her.

"Stella, you have a chance to choose again." His voice grew closer.

A warm hand covered her eyes, his cologne enveloping her. She felt his heated breath against her skin.

"I’m pursuing you."

Stella froze. "But you love someone else."

"At first, I thought you resembled her." His voice deepened. "But now, I see you’re different."

"Stella, have a child with me."

Her entire body stiffened.

"After meeting Luna, I want one of our own."

"Mr. Alistair, are you drunk?"

"Sober or not, it doesn’t matter." His tone was firm. "Be with me. I’ll take care of your family, reclaim the Valentine fortune, and avenge every wrong done to you."

The next morning was bright and clear.

Stella brought a pot of rib soup to the hospital. At the door, she heard her mother’s excited voice.

"My daughter skipped grades and graduated from the best design school!"

The nurse laughed. "She must have an amazing husband."

"Of course!" Grace Laurent’s voice brimmed with pride. "All I care about is that he treats her well."

"You’re so lucky."

"And I have a granddaughter! I can’t wait to meet her!"

Stella pushed the door open. "Mom."

"Stella!" Grace’s eyes lit up. "Where’s Luna?"

"The hospital has too many germs. You’ll see her after discharge." She ladled soup, avoiding her mother’s hopeful gaze.

"Right, she’s still so small." Grace pulled her down to sit. "You just gave birth—stop running around."

"Mm."

"Oh," Grace lowered her voice, "no intimacy during postpartum recovery. It’s bad for your health—"

Stella’s ears burned. "Mom!"

"Don’t be shy." Grace grinned. "Once Luna’s older, have more children. The Valentines only have you, and the Rolands only have Adrian. A big family is livelier."
###Chapter 54: The Truth Behind Martha's Death

Stella forced a faint smile. "Mom, drink the soup while it's hot."

Grace took the bowl but kept her eyes fixed on her daughter. "Are you and Adrian still giving each other the silent treatment?"

"Nothing like that..."

"Don't lie to me," Grace sighed. "I could tell something was off last time. Stella, about Adrian's parents—"

"Mom!" Stella shot to her feet. "I need to go pay the hospital bill downstairs. Enjoy your soup."

She grabbed her phone and hurried out of the room as if fleeing from a monster.

The car accident six years ago had left a wound that would never heal—one that bled at the slightest touch.

Her father, a drunk driver?

It was Lily's carefully orchestrated murder, yet her father bore the blame.

Adrian had lost both parents, but hadn't she lost the father who adored her too?

With her father gone, her mother fragile, and the family business stolen, her life had shattered overnight.

"Miss Valentine?" A nurse's voice called from the hallway.

Stella paused, recognizing her mother's assigned nurse. "Hello."

The nurse smiled warmly. "Your mother is recovering well."

"Thanks to your care."

"It's our job." The nurse suddenly lowered her voice. "By the way, someone was asking about you a few days ago. I followed your instructions and said it was just an appendectomy."

Stella's heart tightened. "Man or woman?"

"A young man claiming to be a distant relative. I brushed him off, but the medical records..."

At the mention of records, Stella remembered something. "Nurse, do hospital records ever go missing?"

"Normally, no. Unless the system gets hacked or the hard drives are wiped. That happened here six or seven years ago, but security's been tightened since."

Stella pressed further. "Which year exactly?"

"Around 2014, I think. Why do you ask?"

"No reason." Stella changed the subject. "About my mother's recent treatment fees..."

The nurse looked surprised. "But a million was already prepaid. It covers everything until discharge."

Stella froze. "A million? Who paid it?"

"A gentleman. I assumed he was family... You didn't know?"

Her uncle would never be that generous.

Could it be... Mr. Alistair?

Had he come to the hospital?

"Nurse, was it a bank transfer?"

"Yes, a card payment."

"Can we check the transaction records?" Stella grabbed the nurse's hand urgently. "Or the signed receipt?"

If she could just see the signature...

"Sorry, that's confidential financial information." The nurse hesitated. "But he was tall, wearing a mask and a baseball cap."

Stella managed a weak smile. "Thank you. I just wanted to thank him in person."

The nurse reassured her, "If he wanted to stay anonymous, he probably prefers privacy."

Beep—

Her phone vibrated.

[Stella, you'll meet the real me when the time is right.]

Mr. Alistair's texts always arrived at the perfect moment.

[Sorry, I overstepped.]

[Have you thought about my proposal from yesterday?]

Stella bit her lip, his deep voice echoing in her ears: "I'm pursuing you."

Five simple words that made her ears burn.

[No need to rush your answer.]

He always sensed her discomfort and gave her an out.

She typed a long reply, then deleted it all, sending just one word: [Okay.]

......

New Frontier Group CEO's office.

Adrian stared at documents, but his mind replayed Stella's tender profile as she held their child.

Knock knock—

His assistant Vincent entered. "Mr. Roland, the police called. New developments in Martha's case."

"What developments?"

"The killer might be someone else."

Thirty minutes later, at the police station.

Adrian's gaze locked onto the surveillance monitor.

"No suspicious vehicles near the villa that day," the officer pointed at the footage. "But this shop's camera caught something crucial."

3:26 PM—a dark figure plummeted from the villa's rooftop.

"Look here—" The officer zoomed in on a corner. "That's your second-floor bedroom window."

Adrian's pupils contracted.

As Martha fell, someone was clearly lying on the bedroom bed!

Only after the crash did the person jump up in alarm and rush to the window—

It was unmistakably Stella!
###Chapter 55: Cracks in the Truth

Only three people were in the villa.

Martha Clementson. Stella Valentine. Lily Savigny.

The surveillance footage clearly showed the moment—Stella wasn't even present.

"Mr. Roland, did Ms. Savigny and Martha have any prior contact?"

The officer's question cut through Adrian's thoughts like a knife.

After the car accident six years ago, he had isolated himself in the old family estate. Martha would visit occasionally. Lily stayed by his side.

They knew of each other's existence.

But they had never actually met.

"...No."

The officers exchanged confused glances.

"Motive? Why would a stranger kill Martha?"

"Unless..."

"The villa's surveillance shows no outsiders entered in the past seven days."

"Could it be..."

When Adrian stepped out of the police station, the setting sun stretched his shadow long across the pavement.

His phone screen lit up—twenty-three missed calls.

All from Lily.

"Adrian!" Her voice was urgent, laced with a coquettish whine. "Mom keeps asking when we're getting our marriage license."

He closed his eyes.

"Adrian?"

"Bad signal." His voice was hoarse.

"That day at the jewelry store, Stella must have been following us! How else could she afford such an expensive ring—"

"Lily."

"Yes?"

"I'm exhausted."

"But the marriage license—"

"Martha's case isn't closed yet." His tone turned icy. "I won't let her death go unanswered."

Silence on the other end.

"...Wasn't it Stella who pushed her?" Lily's voice trembled slightly.

"You saw it happen?"

"Of course! I tried to stop her but—"

"Lily." He cut her off. "I despise lies more than anything."

Shallow breathing filled the line.

"The police have surveillance footage." He spoke each word deliberately. "It chilled me to the bone."

"What footage?!" Her voice sharpened.

"We're done."

"Because of Stella? Or that bastard child of hers?"

"Because you crossed the line."

......

Stella stood outside the Houston Grand Hotel.

The taxi had just pulled away when she spotted the familiar small figure.

"Miss!" The boy waved at her, clutching a soccer ball.

His eyes were still bright, but his face looked paler.

"Mom's working." He pointed at the hotel. "My illness... got worse."

Stella followed his gaze.

A gaunt woman mopped the lobby floor, her faded clothes worn thin from washing.

"Miss, I'll sing for you." The boy suddenly offered. "No charge."

His childish voice carried the tune of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," piercingly clear in the twilight.

The woman emerged dragging a bucket, wiping her rough hands on her apron.

"Miss..." She stood awkwardly. "Could I trouble you for a moment?"

Her eyes held too many unspoken emotions.
###Chapter 56: Intertwined Fates

Stella Valentine led the woman into a chain coffee shop near the hotel.

The woman hesitated at the entrance, fingers twisting the faded hem of her shirt. "Miss, this place is too expensive..."

"It's fine." Stella pulled out a chair. "Just keep me company for a while."

The woman sat down cautiously, her face paling further as she scanned the menu.

"What did you want to talk about?" Stella handed her a tissue.

Tears suddenly spilled from the woman's eyes. "Miss, I know I shouldn't trouble you, but I have nowhere else to turn..."

"Take your time."

"I..." The woman trembled as she pulled a crumpled medical report from her pocket. "Stage four liver cancer."

Stella's pupils contracted slightly.

"My son has congenital heart disease." The woman choked back a sob. "I've worked myself to the bone all these years, but a cleaner's salary can't even cover his medication..."

"So you want to..."

"I want to entrust my child to you." The woman finally broke down. "I know it's too much to ask, but there's no one else!"

Stella's fingertips turned cold.

How cruelly ironic fate could be.

She had once found solace in that little boy's singing voice. Now she faced this impossible request.

"What about the father?"

The woman gave a bitter smile. "He remarried long ago. Now he's a general manager at New Frontier Group."

Stella's coffee cup trembled in her hand.

"Chen?"

The woman looked up in surprise. "How did you know?"

Stella closed her eyes briefly.

What a damned coincidence.

"I'm sorry, but I can't help you." Her voice was soft.

The light in the woman's eyes extinguished instantly. "I was being naive..."

"Because I have lung cancer too." Stella said calmly. "Stage four."

Silence stretched between them, thick with shared despair.

"I can help you contact an orphanage." Stella finally offered.

The woman nodded through her tears. "Thank you..."

Outside the coffee shop, the little boy immediately rushed into his mother's arms.

"Mom, we need to get to the next job."

The woman bid a hurried farewell, clutching her child's hand as they disappeared into the night.

Stella stood motionless, watching until their figures vanished.

Back in the hotel suite, Mr. Alistair's deep voice emerged from the darkness. "You're back."

"Yes."

"How's your mother?"

"Stable." Stella removed her coat. "Mr. Alistair... thank you for the medical expenses."

The clink of glass came from the liquor cabinet. "No need for thanks."

Approaching, she saw him selecting a bottle of wine.

"Mr. Alistair." She spoke suddenly. "What can I do for you?"

His movements stilled. "Why ask that now?"

"You've given me so much." Her voice tightened. "Seven million. My mother's treatment..."

He chuckled. "Traditionally, such debts are repaid with one's body."

The room fell silent.

"Have you decided about yesterday's matter?" He asked abruptly.

Stella took a deep breath. "Mr. Alistair... what if she comes back to you?"

The wineglass tilted slightly in his hand.

"She won't."

"But if she does?"

"There are no 'what ifs.'" His voice turned icy. "This is the last respect I can show her."

He finally selected a dessert wine, pouring it into two crystal glasses.

"Care for a drink?"

Stella accepted the glass. "What shall we toast to?"

Mr. Alistair gazed at the stars beyond the window. "To this night."

Their glasses met with a crystalline chime.

Like fate's ineffable sigh when paths intertwine.
###Chapter 57: A Friend of Mine

The night was ink-black, the moonlight tracing Mr. Alistair's tall frame with a cold, silver outline.

Stella Valentine studied his profile, her heart stirring. How could such an exceptional man be so ruthlessly abandoned by a woman?

To the world, Mr. Alistair was nearly flawless—successful, gentle, considerate, exuding mature charm with every gesture. A man like him should have been the dream of countless women.

"Stella, what's on your mind?"

She snapped out of her thoughts, her fingers lightly tracing the stem of her wine glass. "Nothing. Just tired."

His voice was feather-soft. "You've been working too hard. You need rest."

"Mr. Alistair... may I ask you for a favor?"

"Is it about your daughter?"

"No." She bit her lip. "Do you know which orphanage in Houston is the most reliable?"

He raised an eyebrow. "Why the sudden question? Worried Adrian might send your daughter to one?"

"It's for... a friend." Her voice grew quieter.

Mr. Alistair chuckled, the red wine leaving a dark stain on his lips. "Stella, when people say 'a friend,' they usually mean themselves."

"It's really not me!" Her cheeks flushed with urgency. "She has a six-year-old son..."

"So Hugo Merovingian doesn’t plan to raise the boy anymore?"

Her pupils contracted. He even knew about Hugo.

"Ethan is doing well in the U.S. Hugo wouldn’t abandon him," she murmured in defense.

Mr. Alistair swirled his glass. "Hugo seems quite devoted to your son."

"He’s helped me a lot."

"Do you love him?"

Stella shook her head. "I’ll never love anyone else in this lifetime."

"Adrian hurt you deeply." His gaze was as fathomless as the ocean.

She lowered her lashes, silent.

"It’s alright," he said, his voice tender yet firm. "I’ll make you believe in love again."

"..."

"You don’t trust me?"

"It’s not that." She just didn’t believe she deserved happiness anymore.

"I’ll have someone compile the orphanage information." He set down his glass. "Get some rest."

A shrill phone ring shattered the morning silence.

"Hello?"

"Miss Stella Valentine? You have a local delivery."

Puzzled, she opened the door and signed for a document envelope. When she tore it open, she froze.

Inside were detailed profiles of every orphanage in Houston—environment, staff, every meticulous detail.

Mr. Alistair worked frighteningly fast.

She flipped through the envelope. The sender’s name simply read "Mr. Alistair," with only a courier station listed as the address.

Stella smiled bitterly. Of course he left no traces.

That afternoon, she found Claire Florent cleaning in the lobby.

"Miss Stella!" The woman’s eyes reddened as she gratefully accepted the documents. "Thank you so much..."

"Thank my boss, not me."

"You’re both kind people. Good karma will come your way."

Stella forced a weak smile.

"Hey! No chatting during work hours!" The manager’s sharp voice cut through.

Claire hurriedly tucked away the papers. "Miss Stella, I have to get back to work."

"Is Oliver still outside?"

"The manager won’t let him in..."

Stella glanced toward the entrance. In the cold wind, the little boy was curled into a tiny ball, like an abandoned kitten.

Her heart clenched. She strode toward the door.

"Auntie!" Oliver’s eyes lit up when he saw her.

"Come inside with me to wait for your mom." She took his freezing hand.

He shrank back timidly. "The mean man will yell..."

"I’m here. Don’t be afraid."

The moment they stepped into the lobby, the manager stormed over. "Who let you in? Out!"

Oliver hid behind Stella, trembling.

"He’s my child. Why can’t he be here?" She shielded him.

The manager sneered. "You? Do you know how expensive this hotel is? A cleaner’s monthly salary couldn’t even cover one night!"

"I’m staying here right now."

"Liar! Look at how shabby you—" He reached out to shove her.

Stella sidestepped, but his hand grazed her wound. Agony exploded through her body. Darkness swallowed her vision as she staggered, barely catching herself against the wall.
###Chapter 58: Who's Your Boss?

A sharp pain shot through Stella's chest. Her legs gave way, sending her crashing to her knees.

Oliver burst into tears. "Auntie! What's wrong? Uncle, why did you push her?"

The front desk manager scoffed. "I barely touched her. What's this act? Scamming people with a kid now?"

Stella clenched her jaw as cold sweat trickled down her forehead.

"You've got three seconds to leave before I call security." The manager grabbed his walkie-talkie. "Security to lobby. Disturbance in progress."

Oliver clung to Stella's hand. "Auntie, let's go. I don't want to go in anymore..."

Stella forced a weak smile. "Don't be afraid."

Four burly security guards approached, reaching to grab them.

"Stop!"

A man's urgent voice rang out from the entrance.

The hotel director rushed in, panting and pale-faced. "Everyone freeze!"

The manager immediately switched to a fawning expression. "Director, these two—"

"Shut it!" The director glared. "Do you know who she is?"

The manager froze.

The director lowered his voice. "Guest in Room 1231. Personally arranged by the boss."

"What?" The manager's legs wobbled. "But she just said—"

Stella spoke weakly. "I'm staying in 1231."

The manager turned ashen.

The director smacked the back of his head. "That's the boss's private suite! You're finished!"

"Miss, I'm so sorry!" The manager dropped to his knees. "I was blind—"

Stella slowly stood, shielding Oliver behind her.

"Auntie..." Oliver sniffled, clutching her sleeve.

"Go find your mom." Stella patted his head.

Once the child was gone, the manager trembled. "That boy...he's not the boss's?"

"Does it matter?" Stella's voice was icy.

The manager shook his head frantically. "No, no! He can come anytime now!"

Stella glanced at the cleaning lady and her daughter in the corner.

"I'll triple her salary immediately!" The director rushed to promise.

The roar of an engine sounded in the distance.

The director exhaled in relief. "The boss is back!"
###Chapter 59: An Unexpected Invitation

Stella Valentine whirled around, her gaze piercing through the revolving doors of the hotel.

The familiar black Cayenne was pulling up to the entrance.

Her heartbeat accelerated instantly.

Mr. Alistair never appeared during daylight—their meetings always took place in darkened rooms.

Yet now, the sun blazed overhead.

The car door opened. Polished leather shoes stepped out, followed by long legs clad in silver-gray suit pants.

A tall, imposing figure emerged from the driver's seat.

His back was turned as he spoke with the valet.

Stella held her breath, watching as he turned—

"Miss Valentine." A young man approached with a smile. "Mr. Alistair sent me to fetch you."

Not him.

Just the same driver who'd taken her to the Shi residence last time.

Her brows furrowed slightly. "Now?"

"Yes. He insisted it's urgent."

Mr. Alistair needed her—for something urgent?

She couldn't fathom what it might be.

Oliver's mother approached timidly. "Miss Valentine, have I caused trouble for you again?"

She kept bowing apologetically to the hotel manager.

The manager hastily steadied her. "We'd never dare inconvenience Miss Valentine—"

The driver arched an eyebrow. "What's going on?"

"Nothing important." Stella cut in. "Mr. Alistair's business takes priority."

She cast a final glance at Oliver and his mother. "Please look after them, Manager."

"Of course!" The manager fawned with exaggerated nods.

Stella followed the driver into the car.

Through the rearview mirror, she studied his profile.

He chuckled. "If you keep staring like that, Mr. Alistair might get jealous."

"What should I call you?"

"Charlie Macmillan. Just Charlie is fine."

"Why does Mr. Alistair need me?"

"I'm just driving you to a seafood restaurant. That's all I know."

"Seafood?"

"Not his usual preference, but maybe he's craving something different."

Thirty minutes later, the car stopped before a dilapidated seafood shack.

Stella froze.

This was the polar opposite of the upscale venues she'd envisioned.

"Private room 005. He's waiting." Charlie urged.

The hostess blocked her path. "Sorry, we're fully booked today."

"My friend reserved room 005."

The hostess's demeanor shifted instantly. "This way, please!"

The staircase was long and steep.

Her abdominal wound throbbed with each step, sharp as a blade.

She discreetly swallowed a painkiller.

"Here we are." The server pushed open the private room door.

It was empty.

"My friend hasn't arrived?"

"He prepaid for our premium dining package."

Apparently, Mr. Alistair wasn't coming.

She texted him: 【I'm here】

The reply came instantly: 【Good】

【Are you coming?】
【No】
【What should I do?】
【Eat well】

Stella didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

He'd made her cross the entire city... just for a meal?

The room's thin walls carried voices from next door—

"Mom, Adrian seems suspicious. He keeps asking where I was when Martha died."

"Don't panic! He has no proof. Focus on getting that marriage certificate!"

"He's been avoiding me lately..."

"Blame Stella's brat! Did you get the old mansion's address?"

"No. By the way, I saw her buy a three-million-dollar diamond ring!"

"Either it's Adrian's guilt money, or—"

"He despises Stella. No way he'd give her anything."

"Then she's got a new sugar daddy. Not many men in Houston spend like that..."

Stella's grip tightened around her water glass.

So this mother-daughter duo had been scheming against Adrian all along.
###Chapter 60 I'm Done Playing Games

Stella Valentine's fingers clenched the hem of her shirt through the thin wall.

Lily Savigny and Sophia Durand's voices carried clearly, each word stabbing into her heart like a knife.

Her phone screen lit up.

[Did you hear?] Mr. Alistair's text arrived right on time.

Her fingers trembled as she replied: [I heard.]

[Do you hate them?]

[With every fiber of my being!]

[Want revenge?]

She bit her lip until it bled, the metallic taste spreading: [Yes!]

[Be my woman. Bear my child. I'll make them pay.]

......

"Miss, would you like to order?" The waiter followed her to the doorway.

Stella didn't hear him. Her mind reeled from that text.

Who was Mr. Alistair?

He was like a bottomless whirlpool—calm on the surface, but hiding dangerous undercurrents.

As for the child...

Probably because she resembled the woman he loved.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Yes?"

"Stella, where are you?" Adrian Roland's voice was glacial.

"You changed your number?"

"Why did you block me?"

She laughed coldly. "I'm waiting for the divorce."

"In such a hurry?"

"Just like you couldn't wait to marry Lily six years ago." She enunciated each word. "Free this afternoon? Let's finalize it."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"Where did you get three million?"

"I earned it."

"Three million in half a month?" Adrian scoffed. "Do you think I'm stupid?"

"You're just narrow-minded." Her grip tightened on the phone. "Lily waited six years for you. Hurry up and marry her."

"My life is none of your concern."

"I don't have time for this!"

"Then we won't divorce." Adrian said suddenly. "Return that money to your lover. Cut ties with him."

Stella nearly laughed in disbelief. "Have you lost your mind?"

"......"

"Adrian, don't contact me unless it's about the divorce."

She ended the call with force.

Adrian stared at the darkened screen, his knuckles whitening.

She dared hang up on him?

"Mr. Roland." Vincent Astor entered.

"Any updates?"

"The car your parents were in...may have been scrapped."

Adrian closed his eyes.

That accident changed everything.

His parents gone. The woman he loved turned out to be an accomplice...

He should hate her.

Yet when she appeared at the jewelry store with three million, jealousy nearly consumed him.

Found a new patron so quickly?

"Mr. Roland, about Martha's death—"

"I know."

Vincent hesitated. "The child...DNA tests confirm it's not yours."

Adrian shot to his feet. "What?"

"I ran three tests. Only the first—"

"Enough!"

So she'd betrayed him six years ago.

She fled to America after the accident because the bastard's father was there!

"Should we still retrieve the child?"

"No need." Adrian's eyes turned venomous. "Just some bastard."

......

Stella exhaled sharply after hanging up.

"Miss Valentine, heading home?" Driver Charlie asked respectfully.

"Yes."

"Mr. Alistair said—"

"I know." She cut him off. "Don't ask questions you shouldn't."

Her phone rang again.

"Stella!" Joy Fairsprene's excited voice chirped. "My friend opened a jewelry store! They need designers!"

Stella's eyes lit up. "Really?"

"But his standards are high. Go audition first!"
###Chapter 61: No Need

Joy Fairsprene's message arrived swiftly.

The company profile and address blinked on the screen. Stella Valentine tapped to view them.

The interview was scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM—quite urgent.

"They just landed a major client and are short-staffed," Joy whispered over the phone. "The pay is excellent. Prepare well."

Back at the hotel, Stella immediately researched the company called "Unique Jewelry."

The name stood out.

Each customer could only custom-design a wedding ring here once in their lifetime, symbolizing unwavering devotion.

This rule had offended many wealthy clients. Some tried to reorder for second marriages, offering exorbitant sums, only to be turned away.

Stella chuckled. The owner was stubborn, turning down easy money.

But "Unique" had its appeal. Every pair of rings was exclusively designed by an assigned jeweler, one-of-a-kind worldwide. Unlike ordinary jewelry stores that mass-produced identical pieces.

This very principle tormented the designers.

Each commission demanded entirely new creations, an exhausting workload. Designers quit in droves, leaving the company perpetually hiring. To maintain quality, the owner personally screened candidates, resulting in an abysmal acceptance rate.

Recently, a mysterious tycoon had placed a ten-million-dollar order but rejected all existing designs. Hence the urgent recruitment.

By the time Stella closed her laptop, the city lights had already brightened the night.

She organized her notes and stood to switch off the lamp.

Mr. Alistair would be back soon.

Ten minutes later, the lock clicked softly.

His footsteps sounded heavier than usual.

"Have you eaten?" His voice carried a subdued gloom.

Stella shook her head.

"Why skip meals?"

"Lost track of time... Have you eaten, Mr. Alistair? I'll cook now."

She turned to leave but was abruptly pulled back.

Stumbling, she fell into his familiar embrace.

The scent of eau de cologne enveloped her. Somehow, this fragrance had become a source of comfort.

"Stella..."

His chin rested atop her head, gently rubbing.

Trapped in his arms, she tried to wriggle free.

"Don't move." His voice was hoarse. "Let me hold you. I'm exhausted. This helps."

Her heartbeat quickened. "Mr. Alistair, I'm still married. This isn't..."

"Shh." He inhaled deeply. "Think of it as a hug between friends. I'm tired. Holding you eases the pain."

Stella froze.

The Mr. Alistair she knew was always strong and composed. She'd never seen him so vulnerable.

"Have you been drinking?"

"...I wish I were drunk. Then my heart wouldn't ache like this."

"What happened?"

"Something... It's killing me." His arms tightened. "Stella, are all women this cruel?"

"Huh?"

"Cold-hearted. Cutting with their words. No mercy left."

Her chest constricted.

She understood this pain too well. During her years as Mrs. Roland, Adrian's words had sliced her open, leaving wounds that still ached when remembered.

"Cruelty isn't gendered," she murmured. "Some people refuse to listen. They only believe what suits them."

He leaned his full weight against her. "We're kindred spirits in suffering."

"...Yes. But I've realized life must have meaning. If not for others, then for family and friends. Those who are cruel—once we stop caring, they can't hurt us anymore."

Mr. Alistair went rigid.

"If we stop caring... she becomes nothing..." he repeated under his breath.

"Exactly. I'm fighting for custody of my daughter, supporting my mother, saving to reunite with my son abroad. That's what matters now."

He clutched her suddenly. "Don't go..."

"I'm not going anywhere?"

"You said you're leaving the country..." His voice grew faint. "If you go, what about me? Name your price. I'll pay it. Just stay..."

Stella sensed something amiss.

"Mr. Alistair, let me help you to bed."

Her slender frame couldn't bear his full weight.

He finally straightened but kept hold of her hand. "Promise you won't leave."

"People always move on," she said gently. "I'm doing better now, striving for those I love. You will too. Then you won't need me anymore."

"Will I?"

"Of course. You've helped me. I won't disappear. I'll stay until you find your way."

He chuckled darkly. "What if I never do?"

"You will." Stella shook her head. "A new relationship speeds up healing. You could try matchmaking, meet new people..."

"Matchmaking?" He savored the word.

"Or social mixers? I'm not sure..."

"Did you move on because you found someone new?"

She bit her lip. "We... should've ended long ago. I just finally accepted it—letting each other go."

"And in the future... would you consider someone else?"

"I don't know." She sighed. "With two children, perhaps... there's no need."

Mr. Alistair suddenly bent down, pressing a kiss to her hand.

"Stella, if you ever want to start anew," his voice was barely a whisper, "give me first consideration. Please."
###Chapter 62: Fate's Intertwining

The night was deep and silent.

Mr. Alistair tossed and turned all night.

Stella Valentine could hear his muffled sobs—like a wounded beast licking its wounds in the dark. She lay rigid, afraid to move, unwilling to disturb what little dignity he had left.

Dawn crept in before she finally drifted into a fitful sleep.

The alarm blared at seven sharp.

The sheets beside her were smooth and untouched, as if no one had ever been there. She had grown accustomed to this eerie phenomenon—every night in Room 1231 of Houston Grand Hotel, she slept soundly, never noticing when he slipped away.

After washing up, she applied a light layer of makeup in the mirror.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Stella, are you on your way?" Joy Fairsprene's voice crackled with urgency.

Stella glanced at the blur of scenery outside the taxi window. "Fifteen minutes."

"Perfect!" Joy exhaled in relief. "My friend despises tardiness."

"Professionalism. I understand."

"There's more," Joy lowered her voice. "He has a thing against beautiful women."

Stella arched a brow. "Why?"

"Got burned by his first love. Once rejected a brilliant female designer just because she was pretty." Joy hesitated. "Don’t wear any makeup today!"

A soft chuckle escaped Stella. "Already wiped it off."

"No, no, your bare face is still too—" Joy gasped. "Wait! Is there an eyewear shop nearby? Get the ugliest black-framed glasses you can find!"

The taxi happened to pass one.

Stella hurried inside.

"Need an eye exam, miss?" The clerk beamed.

"Black frames." She cut straight to the point. "The uglier, the better."

The clerk's smile froze.

Five minutes later, she emerged wearing a pair of hideously thick glasses. The reflection staring back resembled a bookish nerd. Satisfied, she smirked.

As she walked toward Unique Jewelry, memories flooded in.

During her design studies abroad, rings had been her specialty. She once sketched a "Stella Ring" for an engagement—sapphire base with diamond accents. The draft had caused a sensation—

She shook her head violently, forcing herself back to reality.

The company's entrance loomed ahead.

"Miss Stella Valentine?" The receptionist smiled. "Ms. Fairsprene notified us. Please follow me."

The elevator ascended to the conference floor.

Through the glass wall, she spotted two unexpected figures—Adrian Roland and Lily Savigny seated across from a slick-suited man oozing sycophancy.

"These are the VIP clients?" Stella whispered.

The receptionist nodded. "Mr. Roland has high standards. All our designers' proposals were rejected."

Stella drew a sharp breath and pushed the door open.

Three pairs of eyes snapped toward her.

Adrian's pupils constricted. Lily's face twisted. The suited man frowned. "You're the designer Ms. Fairsprene recommended?"

"I'm Stella Valentine."

His scrutinizing gaze dripped with skepticism. "She claimed you're a once-in-a-century genius—"

Stella nearly bit her tongue.

That exaggerating Joy.

"She might've oversold to help me." Her voice remained steady.

"Wait in my office." He waved dismissively. "End of the hall—Manager Quentin's office."

She turned to leave.

"Wait."

Adrian stood abruptly, his voice a low rumble. "Let her try."

Manager Quentin gaped. "But she hasn't even—"

"Your designers keep disappointing Lily." Adrian's gaze pinned Stella in place. "Give the newcomer a shot."
###Chapter 63: Have You No Heart at All?

Adrian's words struck like thunder.

Lily was the first to react, gently tugging his sleeve. "Adrian, isn't this inappropriate? After all, you two—"

"Shut up." His gaze remained locked on Stella.

She wore clothes from six years ago and outdated black-framed glasses—nothing like the heiress she once was.

Beads of sweat formed on the manager's forehead. "Mr. Roland, are you sure you want this newcomer to design it?"

"Is there a problem?" Adrian sneered. "She knows me best."

Understanding dawned on the manager.

An ex-girlfriend.

His tone shifted instantly. "Miss, please have a seat. Mr. Roland has high standards, so I hope you—"

"No special treatment." Adrian cut him off. "If the design fails, she’s out."

Stella clenched the pen in her hand.

She should have expected this.

"Please state your requirements," she forced herself to say professionally.

Adrian scoffed. "I’ve said it countless times."

Stella turned to the manager. "May I see the previous records?"

The computer screen displayed pages of demands that nearly made her laugh.

Lily wanted a 12-carat heart-shaped diamond ring, while Adrian preferred minimalist styles.

An impossible task.

"I’ve reviewed everything," she closed the laptop. "Miss Savigny wants romance, while Mr. Roland leans toward business minimalism. Correct?"

Lily lifted her chin. "If the design disappoints, I won’t compromise."

"Understood."

"We’re getting married next month," Adrian suddenly announced.

Stella’s fingers trembled. "Congratulations. Then let’s finalize the divorce after this interview. I brought all the documents."

"So eager?" Adrian shot to his feet. "Our daughter is still so young, and you’ve already moved on?"

"And you?" Stella finally snapped. "Who took her from me? Who’s here designing wedding rings with his mistress?"

"You—"

"If custody goes to me, I’ll never remarry! Can you say the same, Adrian? Are you even fit to be a father?"

The air froze.

Lily turned pale.

The manager stumbled back.

Adrian slammed his fist on the table. "Stella Valentine, have you no heart at all?!"
###Chapter 64: The Truth Revealed

Adrian stood frozen.

Stella's violent reaction caught him off guard.

"Adrian, we've reached this point." Her voice was icy. "You have someone new. Why bother with me?"

"Bother?" His brows furrowed.

"Do we have to torture each other?" Stella met his gaze. "Marry whoever you want. But my daughter will never call a murderer 'stepmother.'"

Adrian sneered. "You think you can stop me? I could ruin your life in Houston."

"I believe you." She straightened her back. "But for my daughter, I'd risk everything."

Outside the glass conference room, employees paused to watch.

Whispers spread like wildfire.

The manager hurriedly shooed them away. "Everyone, take half the day off. Leave now!"

Within minutes, only the three of them remained.

"Stella, I don't trust you," Adrian said darkly.

"Good. I don't trust you either." Her eyes flicked to Lily. "Especially after you chose her."

Lily's face turned ashen.

Six years of scheming, just for Adrian to finally agree to look at wedding rings with her—ruined by Stella!

"What do you mean?" Lily finally shrieked. "'Snake-hearted'?"

Stella smirked. "You dare ask me that?"

"Stella!" Lily trembled with rage. "Your son's illness has nothing to do with me! You were careless during pregnancy!"

"Interesting." Stella narrowed her eyes. "Even Adrian doesn't know what illness Ethan has. Yet you're so well-informed?"

Lily paled.

"Lily, I'll make you pay for everything you owe me." Stella enunciated each word. "My son. My mother. My father. And Martha!"

Lily clutched Adrian's arm. "Adrian, she's slandering me!"

He pulled away. "Enough."

"You're defending her?" Tears spilled from Lily's eyes. "I've been by your side for six years!"

"I know." He massaged his temples wearily.

"Then why don't you believe me?"

Adrian suddenly looked up. "Because evidence doesn't lie."

Lily froze.

"The police found new proof." His voice was hoarse. "The villa's surveillance footage shows Stella was asleep when Martha fell."

Lily's legs gave out.

"If it wasn't you or her, did Martha jump?" Adrian laughed bitterly. "Lily, I saw the footage."

"N-no... That's not what happened..."

"Martha raised me. Why kill her?" His voice shook. "Just to frame Stella?"

Lily collapsed to the floor. "She insulted me first... I only gave her a little push..."

"So it was you." Stella's smile was cold. "Lily, you disgust me."

Adrian closed his eyes in pain. "Lily, I wanted to pretend I didn't know..."

"Adrian!" She clung to his leg. "I did it because I love you!"

Stella turned and walked away.

She couldn't bear to watch this farce a second longer.
###Chapter 65: I'll Prove Myself

Lily Savigny's face turned deathly pale.

"Adrian, you knew all along?"

Adrian Roland leaned back on the sofa, eyes closed in exhaustion. "Does it even matter now?"

"At least..." Lily bit her lip. "At least you still wanted to marry me after learning the truth, right?"

Adrian gave a bitter, self-deprecating smile.

Marriage?

Once, he had looked forward to it with all his heart. But the recent flood of revelations had left him utterly disillusioned.

"Lily, I despise deception most of all."

"Adrian, I can explain! It was all just accidents—"

"Accidentally going to the rooftop?" Adrian cut her off sharply. "Accidentally arguing with Martha? Accidentally watching her fall? Accidentally framing Stella for it?"

Lily fell silent.

The manager standing nearby shifted uncomfortably. This was elite family drama he had no business hearing—especially when it involved a death.

"Mr. Roland, perhaps I should step out—"

Stella Valentine spoke up calmly. "Manager, I came for the job interview. Does this order still require my attention?"

The manager hesitated. "Well..."

He glanced nervously at Adrian.

"Change it to a single ring," Adrian said abruptly. "Two rings redesigned into one. Same price, but the design must meet my standards."

The manager nodded eagerly. "Of course! Then we'll have this designer—"

"Another day." Adrian stood and walked out without looking back.

Lily grabbed his arm in panic. "Adrian!"

He shook her off. "We both need space."

The conference room fell silent.

As Stella methodically gathered her materials, Lily suddenly lashed out. "Stella, are you satisfied now?"

Stella smiled faintly. "Quite the performance. Your acting has slipped."

"Don't get smug! Adrian only loves me!"

"What does that have to do with me?"

"Stop pretending to be noble! You just want to use your child to trap him!"

Stella rose, her gaze icy. "If he hadn't taken my child, I'd have preferred he never knew of their existence."

"You—"

The door swung open abruptly.

A young man strode in, frowning. "What's going on here?"

The manager hurried forward. "Mr. Valence, this is the designer here for the interview—"

Victor Valence raised a hand, cutting him off as he scrutinized Stella. "Here for the job?"

"Yes. I'm Stella Valentine."

He smirked. "A designer? I'd have guessed janitor."

The manager tried to explain. "Mr. Valence, she's Mr. Roland's ex. Having her here could—"

"Unnecessary." Victor's voice turned glacial. "This company runs on merit, not connections. Ex-girlfriend? Current girlfriend wouldn't make a difference if she's incompetent."

"But the company needs—"

"Enough!" Victor snapped. "If she's not gone in ten minutes, you're fired too."

The manager turned helplessly to Stella. "Miss Valentine, I'm sorry—"

"Wait." Stella took a deep breath. "Mr. Valence, I respect your commitment to quality. But Adrian and I are completely over. Give me a fair chance. If my designs don't measure up, I'll leave immediately."

Victor raised an eyebrow. "You're sure?"

"Let me try."

"You can't even dress yourself properly, yet want to design jewelry? Gemstones don't allow do-overs."

Stella glanced down at her simple outfit, puzzled.

"My appearance doesn't affect my skills."

Victor suddenly laughed. "Interesting. Nine tomorrow. Bring your portfolio."

Stella's eyes lit up. "Thank you, Mr. Valence!"

"Don't celebrate yet. I've fired top designers before."

"I know."

"Confident, are you?"

"No." Stella met his gaze squarely. "But I need this job. I'll prove myself."

"Money troubles?"

"Yes."

His eyes flicked to her faded clothes. "Obviously."

"My apologies. I'll dress appropriately tomorrow."

"More curious—someone this desperate might be tempted with our materials..."

Stella remained composed. "I only design. I don't handle physical inventory."

Victor studied her with newfound interest. "Fascinating. If the designs fail, we could always use another janitor."
###Chapter 66: First Glimpse of Brilliance

At 8:15 in the morning, Stella Valentine stood at the entrance of Unique Jewelry.

She glanced down at her slightly outdated business suit—the newest one in her closet.

Six years without buying new clothes had made her forget what shopping even felt like.

Behind her black-framed glasses, her eyes flashed with determination.

Joy Fairsprene's words echoed in her mind: "Victor Valence is eccentric—he actually dislikes women who dress too meticulously."

"Miss Valentine, Mr. Valence is waiting for you in the conference room," the receptionist said with a practiced smile, leading her to the elevator.

Pushing open the conference room door, Stella hesitated for a fraction of a second.

Twenty pairs of eyes turned to scrutinize her.

Victor sat at the head of the table, his long fingers tapping the surface. "Perfect timing. Saves me the trouble of sending someone to fetch you."

A turquoise jewelry design was projected on the screen.

"Tell me your thoughts," Victor said bluntly.

Stella took a deep breath. "It's beautiful."

A few mocking chuckles broke out in the room.

"Is this the level of expertise we're interviewing now?"
"Anyone can call themselves a designer these days."
"Ordinary yet so confident."

Victor's eyes flickered with disappointment as he raised his hand to dismiss her.

"But—" Stella's voice rang clear. "This design has three fatal flaws."

The room fell silent.

She walked to the projector, her slender finger pointing at the screen. "First, pairing turquoise with gold is garish. Second, the necklace clasp is overly complicated. Third..."

Her gaze swept across every designer present. "At least two people worked on this piece."

A woman in a yellow blouse jerked her head up from the corner.

"The floral motif on the brooch was clearly added later," Stella said, locking eyes with her. "And it's a style the client rejected multiple times."

The designer paled. "That's nonsense!"

The manager looked stunned. "She's right. We did cycle through three designers for this project. The clients were a mother and daughter with clashing tastes..."

"Give me fifteen minutes," Stella suddenly said.

"What?"

"I can revise it now."

Victor narrowed his eyes. "You're sure?"

Stella had already picked up a pencil. "I need the measurements."

The room was so quiet, only the sound of graphite scratching paper could be heard.

Fifteen minutes later, she set the pencil down.

"Replace the gold with platinum for the necklace, lengthen the fringe to accentuate the neckline. Switch the earrings to teardrop turquoise. As for the brooch..."

She slid the sketch toward Victor. "Change it to a ginkgo leaf—symbolizing eternal love."

Victor studied the drawing, his gaze deepening.

"Why a ginkgo leaf?"

Stella's voice softened. "A daughter's gift to her mother. Nothing is more fitting than eternity."

The yellow-clad designer slammed her hands on the table. "She doesn't even know design software! These hand sketches are worthless—"

"Hired," Victor cut her off. "Start tomorrow."
###Chapter 67: I Never Speak of Uncertainties

Stella Valentine's words sent the conference room into an uproar.

"Hand-drawn sketches in this day and age? Does she even know how to use a computer?"

"Fifteen minutes? She must be joking."

"She's just here for attention!"

Amid the waves of ridicule, only the manager maintained courtesy. "Miss Valentine, are you certain you can finish in fifteen minutes?"

"I'm not."

The manager's expression darkened.

"But I never speak of uncertainties." Stella met his gaze steadily. "Give me a chance. The worst outcome is public humiliation."

The manager hesitated, glancing at Victor Valence.

Victor's long fingers tapped the table, his lips curling into a cold smirk. "Ten minutes. Including memorizing the data. Dare to try?"

"I dare."

Quentin Roland hastily handed her paper, pens, and the measurement chart.

Stella walked to the wall, pressing the sketchboard against it. Her eyes scanned the dense data rapidly before closing the file after three minutes.

"Compass."

"T-square."

"Triangle ruler..." Quentin faltered. "We don't have that one."

Laughter rippled through the room.

Stella ignored them. She raised her pencil, squinting as she measured angles by sight, marking a perfect 45-degree line.

"She's eyeballing it? Insane!"

"No way that's accurate!"

Victor's gaze sharpened. He watched as her pencil and eraser conjured three-dimensional shadows, the obsidian gemstone springing to life on paper.

"One minute left."

Her strokes became a blur—necklace, earrings, brooch, ring, finishing with a pair of ear cuffs.

"Time's up."

Silence swallowed the room.

Quentin leaned in, speechless.

"Measurements match." Victor's voice cut through the stillness. "Margin of error is negligible."

Stella began explaining her design philosophy. She replaced the gemstone with obsidian, used tassels to lighten the weight—every modification aligned flawlessly with the client's needs.

By the end, only her cool, measured voice remained.

Victor stood. "Go to HR."

"Monthly salary of $20K, plus 20% project bonuses."

Stella's pupils contracted slightly.

"The client arrives this afternoon. Close the deal, and you'll earn $50K." He turned away with a final remark. "Master the design software in three days, or you're out."

The crowd surged forward to examine the sketch.

"This level of skill..."

"Even my mentor couldn't..."

As Quentin prepared to escort her to HR, Stella's throat suddenly burned.

A splatter of crimson stained the pristine floor.
###Chapter 68: Secrets Hidden in Time

"Miss Valentine!"

Manager Quentin's alarmed voice pierced the air.

I braced myself against the cold wall, my knuckles turning white from the pressure. The familiar metallic taste rose in my throat again, and I bit my lip hard.

"I'm fine." My voice came out feather-light.

Quentin's hand hovered midair, hesitant to touch me. "Should I call an ambulance?"

"No need." I fished out the pill bottle from my bag, shaking out the last white tablet. The empty container mirrored my dwindling life.

The painkiller dissolved on my tongue, spreading bitterness.

"The floor—"

"Forget the floor!" Quentin wrung his hands. "You're pale as paper. Are you sure you don't need a hospital?"

I shook my head, forcing a smile. "Just an old condition. Won't kill me."

The onboarding process went surprisingly smooth.

When Quentin showed me to my workstation, he hesitated. "About... Mr. Roland's account—"

"Adrian and I are over." I cut him off. "He's engaged now."

Quentin frowned. "His fiancée... I swear I've seen her somewhere before."

I stayed silent. The world had many lookalikes—just like Mr. Alistair and I, strangers who felt inexplicably familiar.

The afternoon meeting took an unexpected turn.

"Oh my God! It is you!" Miss Fiona Valdemar fluttered over like an excited sparrow. "The shining star of Milan Design Institute!"

I froze.

"Those celestial rings you designed were divine!" She gushed breathlessly. "Our entire class applied because of you!"

Madame Valdemar smiled indulgently. "Youthful enthusiasm."

Memories flooded back—Milanese sunlight, studio lamps, abandoned dreams. Who would I be now without that accident?

"Where did you disappear to, senior?" Fiona pressed.

I adjusted my cuff, hiding the scar on my wrist. "Personal matters."

"What a waste!" She suddenly grabbed my hand. "But I found you now! I'll tell everyone the shining star is back!"

"Please don't." I recoiled. "I just want quiet work."

Fiona's gaze dropped to my modest outfit. Her voice softened. "Is it because of the baby?"

I didn't deny it.

As she left, she shoved a card into my hand. "Call me anytime you need help!"

My phone vibrated.

[Adjusting well?]

My breath hitched.

[Are you watching me, Mr. Alistair?]

[I only watch what's worth watching.]

The screen dimmed, then lit again: [Hold your phone steady.]

My hands jerked, nearly dropping it. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, only the bustling crowd moved.

[Where are you?]

[Does it matter?]

I stared at those three words. He was right. Why did it matter? This stranger who refused to meet me.

[Do we know each other?] I typed with trembling fingers.

Each second of waiting stretched like a year.

Finally, the reply came:
[I knew Stella Valentine long before you think.]

"Miss Valentine?" Quentin's voice snapped me back. "Your payroll card—seventy thousand. You can withdraw for emergencies."

I clenched the thin plastic. Seventy thousand—nowhere near the surgery cost.

But it was a start.
###Chapter 69: Fading Memories

Seven hundred thousand.

That amount used to be pocket change in Stella Valentine's past spending records.

Now it had become an ambitious goal requiring her utmost effort.

News of her landing a major client on her first day spread like wildfire through the design department.

"Oh my God!" A ponytailed young girl rushed over. "That mother-daughter pair is notoriously difficult. How did you get them to sign on the spot?"

"Just got lucky." Stella offered a modest smile.

A bespectacled colleague adjusted her black frames. "I've been in this industry for three years and never heard of you. With skills like yours, you shouldn't be unknown."

Stella's fingers absently traced the desk surface. "I... left the industry for six years."

"Six years?!" The ponytailed girl gasped. "Then you were..."

"Raising children." Stella said calmly.

The office fell silent.

The bespectacled woman inhaled sharply. "Your husband must be extraordinary to make you give up your career."

"We're divorced." Stella's soft voice dropped like a stone into still water.

The female colleagues exchanged glances, complex emotions flashing in their eyes.

"Marriage really is a tomb," the ponytailed girl muttered.

"Women should have their own careers," the bespectacled one clenched her fists.

A cold laugh came from the corner. "If everyone thought like you, the jewelry design industry would've collapsed long ago."

The speaker wore a yellow trench coat—the same woman Stella had publicly critiqued that morning.

The office turned deathly quiet.

Stella walked over. "I apologize for this morning. To make amends, how about I treat everyone to dinner?"

"Unnecessary." The woman in yellow didn't look up. "You think everyone wants your pity meal?"

Stella pressed her lips together.

She knew she'd broken an unspoken rule—questioning a senior's design on her first day.

A notification popped up on her computer.

Victor Valence had sent the celebrity list for tomorrow's brand launch, requiring her to select appropriate display jewelry for each star.

Stella immediately immersed herself in work, pushing aside the earlier unpleasantness.

When the下班铃声 sounded, Joy Fairsprene's call arrived right on time.

"Stella! I knew you could do it!" The voice chirped like a lark.

Stella's lips curved unconsciously. "Thanks to your recommendation."

"Stop being modest! Where's my celebratory dinner?"

"How about tonight? I just got the commission—you pick the place."

Joy excitedly named a restaurant—Atlantis Seafood.

Stella's hand froze midair.

Memories flooded back.

"Do you like it?" The young man pointed at the underwater tunnel. "They say proposals here have a 100% success rate."

"Who said I'd marry you!" The girl blushed while hitting him.

"Who else would dare marry this spoiled princess?"

......

"Ma'am?" A waiter's voice brought her back.

Stella found herself already seated at the restaurant. Across from Joy's expectant face, not the youth from her memories.

"You look pale," Joy said worriedly.

"Just thinking about work." Stella forced a smile.

When the waiter brought menus, Joy waved them off. "Such a fancy place—you order, Stella."

Stella expertly selected signature dishes.

"You're quite the connoisseur," the waiter remarked. "These are all the chef's specialties."

"Came here once before," Stella said quietly. "Many years ago."

After the waiter left, Joy whispered, "During college? Did your family bring you?"

"Adrian Roland." Stella said the name as if discussing a stranger.

Joy clapped a hand over her mouth.

"It's all past." Stella watched fish swim by. "Look how cute that clownfish is."

Joy suddenly leaned in. "Remember Zachary Ellison from last time? He's been asking about your preferences."

Stella frowned. "I have two children."

"Two?!" Joy's voice spiked before lowering. "Another one in the States?"

"Mm. Five years old." Stella's gaze followed a blue tang. "Originally planned to take Luna there too."

Joy slammed the table. "That bastard Adrian!"

"Enough." Stella smiled, changing topics. "Try this cream soup—it's special."

Aquarium lights cast rippling shadows across their faces through the water.

Joy suddenly turned serious. "Stella, the best way to forget old love is to start new romance."

Stella watched the fish swimming overhead without replying.

Those beautiful creatures moved freely through azure waters, just like her youth that could never be reclaimed.
###Chapter 70: Know Your Place

Stella Valentine clutched her phone, fingertips trembling slightly.

Mr. Alistair's text had caught her off guard.

[Eating alone again tonight?]

She suddenly remembered she'd forgotten to inform him of her plans. Quickly, she replied: [I'm so sorry, Mr. Alistair. I made dinner plans with Joy. Should I come back now?]

[No need. Enjoy yourself. The room just feels too empty without you.]

The loneliness in his words made her chest tighten.

[My driver is waiting outside the restaurant. Come straight home when you're done.]

[Okay.]

Putting away her phone, she sighed softly.

Mr. Alistair treated her too well—so well it frightened her. Was this tenderness meant for the woman she resembled, or for her true self?

She didn't dare dwell on it.

"Stella!" Joy Fairsprene waved a hand in front of her face. "Stop thinking about work after hours. How about your love life?"

"Right now, I just want to stabilize my career and gain custody." Stella pressed her lips together. "Luna is still with Adrian. I can't relax."

Joy frowned. "Since Lily can't have children, maybe she'll treat Luna better?"

"Impossible." Stella's voice turned icy. "She'd harm elders without hesitation. What's a child to her?"

The waiter arrived with their food, smiling. "Thank you both. Another guest just ordered the same dishes."

Joy beamed. "My friend here is a designer!"

Stella's ears burned. "Joy!"

"You're the best!" Joy raised her juice glass. "To the brightest star!"

After dinner, Joy rushed off to another gathering.

As Stella headed toward Mr. Alistair's car, someone suddenly yanked her into the shadows.

"Whose car is that?" Adrian Roland's voice was dark with anger.

Pain shot through her wrist. Gasping, Stella snapped, "Did you take up stalking as a new hobby, Mr. Roland?"

Seeing her pale face, Adrian instinctively loosened his grip. "Are you okay? I—"

"Know your place." She wrenched free. "Shouldn't an engaged man stop harassing his ex-wife?"

"Ex-wife?" He laughed coldly. "Our divorce isn't finalized."

Stella turned toward the waiting driver. "Let's go."

Adrian seized her wrist again. "Mr. Alistair? You moved on that quickly?"

"Let go!" She struggled. "You abandoned me first!"

"I abandoned you?" His eyes reddened. "Stella, who betrayed whom?"

The driver approached. "Miss Valentine, Mr. Alistair has been waiting."

Suddenly, Adrian swept her off her feet and shoved her into his own car.

"You're insane!" Stella pounded the window.

He slammed the accelerator, voice frigid. "Want that divorce? Spend tonight with me."

The words struck like a slap.

"Or I'll burn the papers." He glared at the pursuing driver in the rearview mirror. "You'll never be free."

Trembling, Stella dialed Mr. Alistair—only for Adrian to snatch her phone and hurl it out the window.

"Adrian!" Her voice broke. "What will Lily say?"

"Since when do I care?" His smile was cruel. "Tonight, you're not going anywhere."
###Chapter 71: Bloodstained Terror

The Maybach shot forward like an arrow released from its bow, its engine roaring.

Stella Valentine clutched the seatbelt, her nails digging into her palms.

"Adrian Roland! Have you lost your mind?"

His knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. "Who was that man?"

"None of your business."

The speedometer needle jerked toward the red line.

Her stomach churned violently, darkness creeping at the edges of her vision.

A screech of tires shattered the night.

Adrian yanked her from the car and swept her into his arms.

"Let me go!"

"Too late."

The bedroom door crashed open, making her flinch.

She landed hard on the mattress, his scorching weight pinning her down.

"I regret it," Adrian rasped, his voice raw.

She struggled wildly, but he easily trapped her wrists above her head.

"Lily Savigny couldn't satisfy you?" Her laugh was brittle. "Since when has the great Mr. Roland been so desperate?"

His eyes darkened dangerously before he crushed his mouth to hers.

The metallic tang of blood bloomed between them.

Stella went rigid. A searing pain tore through her abdomen.

Cold sweat drenched her back.

"What's wrong?" Adrian tensed at her sudden stillness.

She curled into a fetal position, her face ghostly pale.

Crimson spread across the white sheets like a grotesque flower.

Adrian's pupils contracted. "Stella!"

"Hos...pital..." Her whisper faded.

When the housekeeper arrived with wailing Luna, she found Adrian sprinting downstairs, clutching Stella's blood-soaked form.

The infant's cries pierced the air.

"A mother and child share one heart..." The old woman's eyes glistened.

Outside the ER:

"Postoperative wound rupture! Hypovolemic shock!"

The doctor glared at Adrian. "You didn't know she just had breast surgery?"

He stood frozen.

The emergency light bathed his ashen face in hellish red.

Monitors shrieked alarms.

Blood pressure plummeted.

60...50...40...

"Clear!"

"Epinephrine 1mg IV push!"

Stella's frail body convulsed under the electric current before collapsing.

Like a broken doll.

Adrian slammed his fist into the wall, skin splitting over his knuckles.

The realization struck him with brutal clarity—

He was losing her.
###Chapter 72: Critical Condition Notice

At three in the morning, Joy Fairsprene rushed down the hospital corridor in her high heels.

The red emergency light burned her eyes.

Adrian Roland slumped against the wall, his suit wrinkled like a rag, his tie hanging loose around his neck.

Slap!

Her palm struck his face.

"If anything happens to Stella, I swear I'll make you pay!" Joy's voice trembled.

Adrian slowly lifted his head, his eyes bloodshot. "What's wrong with her?"

"Now you care?" Joy sneered. "She just had surgery three days ago. Her wounds haven't even healed, and you made her stand in the rain in the middle of the night?"

Adrian staggered to his feet, bracing himself against the wall.

Surgery? What surgery?

He remembered Stella's pale lips, the way she always unconsciously pressed a hand to her chest.

"Appendicitis?" he muttered.

"Bullshit!" Joy's eyes reddened. "There's a ten-centimeter scar on her chest. Since when does appendicitis require open-heart surgery?"

The emergency room doors swung open.

A masked doctor held up bloodstained gloves. "Next of kin, please sign."

Adrian lunged forward. "I'm her husband."

The doctor frowned at him. "The patient underwent a major lung resection. She now has a severe infection. This is a critical condition notice."

"Lung resection?!" Adrian's voice cracked.

"You didn't know?" The doctor's gaze sharpened. "Only one-third of her left lung remains. The cancer may have metastasized."

Joy's legs gave out as she leaned against the wall.

"Impossible..." Adrian stared at the notice, his hand shaking too violently to sign.

The doctor sighed. "She's been on high-dose painkillers long-term. Her pain levels were at least an eight on the scale. To function normally under that kind of suffering..."

Before he could finish, Adrian slammed his fist into the wall.

Blood seeped from his knuckles, but he felt nothing.

Level eight pain—three times worse than childbirth.

And yet Stella had smiled at him every day, cooked his meals, even...

His phone buzzed.

Vincent Astor's voice came through the receiver. "Mr. Roland, we found the package Stella sent to the U.S. a year ago. It's a video for the child."

Stella's gentle voice echoed through the emergency ward:

"Wait for Mommy, sweetheart... I found a way to save you..."

"I'll bring Daddy to see you..."

Adrian collapsed to his knees, his forehead pressed against the cold tiles.

Finally, he understood.

The bloodstains on the sheets that night weren't from reconstructive surgery.

Stella had just undergone a lung resection, enduring unbearable pain while waiting for him to come home.

And he had walked away without looking back.
###Chapter 73: Repaying What I Owe Her

The recording continued to play.

For over an hour, Stella Valentine's gentle voice filled the hospital room.

Her tone was as soft as a spring breeze, carrying the tender warmth only a mother could possess, pouring all her love into those recordings.

She never told her child she was about to leave this world.

She only said, "Mommy is going to a very beautiful place."

Adrian Roland's knuckles turned white as he pressed them against his chest.

The pain there felt like someone had carved out a piece of his flesh.

"Who is Ethan?" Joy Fairsprene demanded, her eyes red.

Adrian's throat moved as he swallowed hard.

He had never met that child.

But he knew his name was Felix Roland.

Sun, moon, and stars—finally complete.

It was the name they had once agreed upon.

"My son," he rasped, his voice barely recognizable. "Five years old. He's been in the hospital since birth..."

Joy's tears hit the floor.

"Adrian Roland, you're a monster!"

He didn't argue.

Yes, he was a monster.

He hadn't even known his own son existed. He hadn't noticed the woman he loved most was dying.

He had even robbed her of the right to see their daughter.

"Stella gave you two children!" Joy screamed hysterically. "Last time, she swallowed her pride and begged you to save your son, and you forced her to divorce you! This time, right after giving birth, you took her daughter away! Why don't you just die?!"

Adrian stood motionless.

If enduring her curses could bring Stella back to health, he would let her scream at him for the rest of his life.

The emergency room doors suddenly swung open.

"Doctor!" Adrian lunged forward, grabbing the physician's arm. "How is my wife?"

The doctor removed his mask and shook his head.

"Late-stage lung cancer. She could go at any moment..." He paused. "Try to fulfill her last wishes."

"How long does she have?"

"It's uncertain." The doctor sighed. "Could be tomorrow. Could be six months."

Adrian staggered back two steps.

Joy snatched the payment slip and rushed to the nurse's station.

When she returned, Stella had already been moved to the ICU.

Through the glass, Adrian could see her frail body, almost disappearing beneath the sheets.

Dried blood still stained her wrists.

Only the numbers on the monitor proved she was still alive.

"If she stabilizes in three days, she can be moved to a regular room," the doctor said. "But we need to decide on chemotherapy soon."

Joy suddenly seized Adrian's collar.

"Divorce her," she sobbed. "Let her spend her last days in peace."

"I'm her husband."

"Do you deserve to be?" Joy's voice trembled. "In twenty-six years, what have you ever given her?"

Adrian's eyes burned a terrifying red.

"I'll make it up to her," he said, each word deliberate. "With my life."

"She doesn't need that!" Joy shrieked. "She just wants to live her final days in peace!"

Adrian stared at Stella through the ICU window.

"When she wakes up," he murmured, "if she asks for a divorce herself, I'll let her go."

He knew she would say it to his face.

Because his Stella had always been a woman who saw things through to the end.
###Chapter 74: Finale

The oxygen mask fogged up, blurring her vision.

Stella Valentine blinked hard until Joy Fairsprene's tear-streaked face came into focus.

"Stella!" Joy lunged forward to grab her hand. "You're finally awake!"

The warmth of those fingers confirmed she was still alive.

"How long was I out?"

"Three days." Joy wiped her cheeks. "The doctors said if you didn't wake up soon..."

The sharp antiseptic smell stung her nostrils.

This wasn't the same hospital.

Stella suddenly smiled. "So you know now?"

Joy's tears splashed onto her wrist. "Why didn't you tell me?"

"What good would it do?" She stared at the ceiling. "Just one more person to grieve."

"I could've been there for you!" Joy shot upright. "From today onward, I'm your real sister!"

The laugh tugged at Stella's abdominal stitches.

"Don't move!" Joy frantically restrained her. "The doctor said you're still fragile."

Her phone buzzed against the pillow.

A text from Mr. Alistair.

[Why didn't you tell me?]

Joy fumbled to hold the screen closer. "Look! Is it him?"

The call came through abruptly.

"...Mr. Alistair."

"Does it hurt?" His voice through the receiver was liquid morphine.

"Manageable."

"Don't lie." A weighted exhale. "I can always tell."

Stella closed her eyes. "I'm sorry. I won't be able to keep my promise."

"It's alright." Steel wrapped in velvet. "I'll walk this last stretch with you."

Tears breached without warning.

"I want to see you." She gripped the sheets. "Just once."

The silence stretched.

"Stella," his voice roughened, "it's not time yet."

"I understand."

"But I'll find another way to be there."

Joy suddenly tugged her sleeve, pointing at the door.

Through the glass, Adrian Roland's gaunt profile stood sentinel.

"Should I let him in?" Joy whispered.

Stella shook her head. "We ended when the divorce papers were signed."

"But he's been here three days—"

"Joy." Gentle finality. "Please call Damian Chamberlain for me."

Joy hesitated, then nodded.

Stella turned toward the window.

Sunlight streamed across the white walls.

Exactly like the white roses she'd loved in the Roland family garden.
###Chapter 75: That Was Her

Joy Fairsprene pushed open the hospital room door to find Adrian Roland curled in the shadows of the corridor.

His suit was crumpled beyond recognition, the tie hanging loose around his neck. Dark stubble shadowed his jaw, and his once-sharp eyes were now bloodshot, staring vacantly at the floor.

"Stella wants to see you." Joy swallowed the word "scumbag" before it could escape.

Adrian flinched as if struck, his fingers digging into his palms.

"What, scared now?" Joy's laugh was icy. "She's finally willing to talk, and you're chickening out?"

"I know what she'll say." His voice was raw, like sandpaper on skin.

He'd practically lived in the hospital smoking room these past days, the scent of nicotine clinging to him. The nurses had given up evicting him, resigning themselves to leaving him his corner.

Joy crossed her arms. "Then don't keep her waiting."

Adrian rose slowly, pushing the door open with the caution of someone afraid to wake a sleeping beast.

Stella Valentine sat propped against the pillows, the sunlight gilding her pale profile. At the sound of the door, she turned. Her eyes were still pools of nothingness.

"You hurt me," she said.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I'm sorry."

"You'll cover the medical bills."

"Yes." The word came too fast. "And your mother's treatment, I'll—"

"No need." Her interruption was sharp. "It's already taken care of."

His pupils contracted. "By him?"

"Yes."

"Is he... good to you?"

"Better than you were." Her whisper cut like a scalpel. "That's enough."

Adrian's smile was uglier than a grimace. "You're divorcing me to be with him?"

"I just want to repay his kindness with what little time I have left." She shook her head. "Nothing more."

"Can we... not divorce?" His fingers closed around hers, cold as death.

Stella wrenched her hand free. "No."

"Even just on paper—"

"Adrian." Her gaze pinned him. "Why bother?"

Outside, twilight deepened. The first star blinked to life.

"Look." Stella's sudden smile was heartbreaking. "Heaven's pitying me."

Adrian followed her gaze. The sky wasn't fully dark yet, the stars faint but countless.

That was her.

The memory hit like a fist—a girl on tiptoe whispering in his ear: "See? The sky's full of my name."

Tears traced silent paths down Stella's cheeks. "This time... it's really goodbye."
###Chapter 76: Eternal Starlight

"Goodbye" is a double-edged sword.

It carries the hope of reunion yet the finality of parting.

Adrian's hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel.

Stella's last words echoed relentlessly in his ears.

She had spoken so calmly, yet each syllable cut through him like a blunt knife.

Even in rejection, she maintained her grace.

Unlike Lily Savigny, who had shed all pretense - pressuring him into marriage while covering up Martha's death.

The only time he'd seen Stella lose control was when she attacked Lily at the villa.

That day, she'd been a lioness defending her cubs, unrecognizable from her usual composed self.

He returned to the ancestral home late at night.

Moonlight pooled across the courtyard like liquid silver.

Not wanting to wake his sleeping daughter, he leaned against the car door gazing upward.

"Young master!"

The elderly butler Benjamin started upon seeing him at dawn.

"What are you looking at?"

"The stars."

"But it's broad daylight—"

"Stella said stars never disappear." Adrian's voice turned hoarse. "Sunlight just obscures them."

Benjamin frowned. "Miss Stella still won't forgive you?"

"She shouldn't."

"But Luna needs both parents!"

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "I'll prepare Luna's bottle."

......

Three days later, an email shattered the fragile peace.

The sender's name glared from the screen: Hugo Merovingian.

The man who'd raised Ethan for five years was now helping Stella file for divorce.

When the call connected, Hugo's tone was glacial.

"When does Mr. Roland wish to finalize the paperwork?"

"I want to see Ethan."

"He's not your son." Hugo's laugh held no warmth. "Get a paternity test if you don't believe me."

"Stella already told me everything."

Silence crackled through the line.

"You've changed," Hugo finally said. "But the damage is done. Stay away from them."

The dial tone buzzed as Adrian stared blankly at his phone.

Vincent called immediately after.

"Miss Savigny is asking for you."

"Block her." Adrian's voice could have frozen hell. "I'll see her tonight."

After hanging up, he played building blocks with Luna.

Her giggles temporarily numbed the pain.

But some matters demanded resolution.

The apartment door opened to the acrid scent of something burnt.

Lily waved uninjured fingers. "I burned myself cooking—"

"Enough theatrics." Adrian strode past her.

"Do you hate me now?" She chased after him. "This is all Stella's doing—"

"Stella would never stoop to your level."

Lily's face twisted.

Adrian whirled suddenly. "You used my phone to block her?"

"I...I was scared—"

"How did you get my password?"

"Your lockscreen was her photo!" Lily shrieked. "I guessed using your anniversary date!"

Adrian's pupils contracted. "How did you know our anniversary?"

"I—"

"Talk!"
###Chapter 77: The Breakup

Lily Savigny trembled from head to toe.

She had never seen Adrian Roland this furious before.

Even at his angriest, he would simply give her the cold shoulder. But this time, he had ignored her calls for days and was now shouting at her outright.

"Adrian, you—"

Adrian clenched his fists, barely containing his rage. The woman before him bore no resemblance to the one he'd met six years ago.

"You've changed, Lily." His voice dripped with disappointment. "All these years, I rarely mentioned Stella. You two should've been strangers. Yet you knew about our anniversary? Who told you? Or... was our meeting never a coincidence to begin with?"

Lily's heart skipped a beat.

She had slipped up, forgetting how sharp Adrian's instincts were.

Back when he'd despised Stella, he'd overlooked the inconsistencies. But now, his hatred no longer blinded him—Stella was reclaiming his heart.

"It was just a coincidence," she insisted, steadying her voice. "You came to fix your car, and I happened to be the receptionist. How could I have predicted when your car would break down? Or which repair shop you'd choose?"

Adrian closed his eyes briefly. "Explain the anniversary."

"...Dad told me."

"Victor Lefèvre?"

"Yes." Lily bit her lip. "He's Stella's uncle, after all. He knew everything about you two."

"Stella and her uncle were never close. She wouldn't share private matters with him."

"But she would tell her mother!" Lily argued desperately. "Isn't it normal for a daughter to confide in her mom?"

Adrian's lips curled into a cold smile. "Did you send Victor to pry for information?"

"No!"

"Lily." His voice turned glacial. "I despise lies. This is your last chance."

Her face paled. "What will you do? Send me to the police? Accuse me of pushing Martha down the stairs?"

She hoped he'd deny it—or forgive her.

Instead, Adrian countered icily, "Was it really an accident?"

"I—"

"No witnesses, no clear surveillance footage. You can claim it was unintentional." His gaze sharpened like a blade. "But what about your conscience?"

Lily's lips trembled.

"I've pieced most of it together." Adrian's tone was merciless. "Stella left, and you appeared. When I lost everything, you conveniently showed up. Who benefited the most? Victor Lefèvre, Sophia Durand... and you."

"Adrian, you've got it all wrong—"

"The detective was right." He cut her off. "Follow the money."

Her eyes darted away, unable to respond.

Adrian's stare pierced through her. "I've replayed these past years in my head. That car crash took Stella's child and father—she was the real victim. Meanwhile, Victor swallowed both the Valentine and Roland fortunes, then welcomed you all into his mansion."

"You suspect Dad?"

"Shouldn't I?"

"But what does he have to do with the crash? Could he control how Stella's father drove?"

Adrian took a deep breath. "I'll uncover the truth. Lily, I hope you're innocent. But logic tells me otherwise."

Panic flashed in her eyes. "How dare you accuse me? I'd never even met Stella's father back then!"

"If the investigation clears you, I'll apologize and compensate you." His voice was steel. "If not..."

The unspoken threat hung between them.

He couldn't prove Martha's death was murder, but he would never let his parents' crash go unpunished.

"Fine! I'll wait for your apology when you find nothing!" Lily forced defiance into her voice.

"I hope so." Adrian pulled out his keys. "Keep the apartment. You'll receive a settlement. We're done."

......

"Mom! Adrian suspects everything!"

Sophia Durand was mid-facial at a luxury spa when the call came. Her sheet mask slid off in shock.

"How?!"

"That old maid Martha! The police told him 'follow the money,' and now he's accusing Dad! He even thinks our first meeting was staged—"

Sophia bolted upright. "What did you say to him these past days?"

"I couldn't even see him! He blocked my number!" Lily's voice shook. "He just came back and broke up with me—"

"Useless!" Sophia hissed. "Did you at least get the old mansion's address?"

"No chance!"

"Listen." Sophia lowered her voice. "Every man has a weakness. We orchestrated that crash so you could swoop in when he was vulnerable. Now his heart belongs to Stella's bastard. Find that child—"

"What should I do?"

"Check his shopping records." Sophia's eyes gleamed. "Babies need formula and diapers. Get his assistant to leak the delivery address—that's where the mansion is."
###Chapter 78: All I Want Is a Peaceful Life

The relentless rain had lasted an entire week.

Stella Valentine pushed open the hospital room door, her hair still dripping. She cradled the insulated food container protectively against her chest, careful not to let any rainwater seep in.

"Damn weather," she muttered, shaking her damp sleeves. "If this keeps up, I'll start growing mold."

Joy Fairsprene handed her a towel. "I told you not to come."

"Not a chance," Joy winked mysteriously. "Today's meal is special."

Stella arched an eyebrow. "Did your mother invent another new dish?"

"Wrong!" Joy lifted her chin proudly. "I cooked it myself."

Stella burst out laughing. "The great Miss Fairsprene actually stepped into a kitchen? Last time you tried instant noodles, you nearly blew up the stove."

"Hey!" Joy glared indignantly. "People can change, you know? I studied properly this time."

"Fine," Stella's eyes softened with amusement. "After I'm discharged, I'll teach you some of my signature dishes."

Joy suddenly leaned closer. "When did you learn to cook, Stella? I remember you couldn't even fry an egg before."

Memories flooded back—the aroma of spicy grilled squid from the snack street behind their high school. Back when her mother was strict, Adrian Roland would climb the fence to bring it to her, hiding it under his uniform jacket so she could sneak bites.

"Earth to Stella?" Joy waved a hand in front of her face.

She blinked back to reality. "Life... forces you to adapt, I guess."

The room fell silent.

Joy squeezed her hand. "The doctor said the surgery was successful. You'll recover."

Stella turned to the window. Raindrops streaked down the glass like transparent scars.

"Joy, you know what I want most right now? Just an ordinary, peaceful life."

Joy's eyes reddened. "That bastard is still standing downstairs, soaked to the bone."

Stella's fingers twisted the hospital blanket unconsciously.

"He stops me every time to ask about you," Joy said through gritted teeth. "I told him—as long as I keep bringing meals, it means you're still alive."

The phone rang abruptly.

"Mr. Merovingian?" Stella answered.

"Ethan won't stop demanding to see you," Hugo Merovingian's voice held exasperation. "The little rascal nearly smuggled himself back inside a suitcase."

Stella chuckled. "His health improves and the mischief starts."

"Something strange happened," Hugo's tone turned serious. "How did Adrian find out Ethan is his son? Those paternity reports were clearly—"

Joy suddenly interrupted. "The recording! Stella's recording!"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"What recording?" Hugo asked.

Stella's chest tightened. "The messages I recorded for Ethan. I mailed them to you on a USB drive."

"I never received it." Hugo's voice dropped dangerously low.
###Chapter 79: Cruel Fate

Stella Valentine bit her lower lip hard, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Hugo Merovingian's voice came through the phone. "This doesn't make sense. How did the package you sent end up in Adrian Roland's hands? Did he intercept it?"

Stella shook her head, then remembered he couldn't see her. "No," she said softly.

Joy Fairsprene chimed in. "I overheard at the emergency room that day. The package was returned because of a wrong address. Those USB drives were left unattended and just happened to be found by Adrian's assistant..."

Stella's breath hitched.

So that's what happened.

Fate could be so cruel.

Those recordings containing her deepest thoughts had still found their way to Adrian after all.

If this had happened before she gave up hope, everything might have been different.

But now...

"Stella?" Hugo's voice pulled her back to reality. "Leave the divorce to me."

She took a deep breath. "Okay."

"You've been separated for a year. Even if he refuses to sign, we can file for divorce in another year."

A year.

Stella smiled bitterly.

She didn't know if she had that much time left.

After hanging up, Joy suddenly gasped. "Stella! Adrian is still standing downstairs! He's been there in the rain for over ten days now..."

Stella picked up her phone and dialed a long-unused number.

"Ms. Valentine?" Damian Chamberlain's voice held surprise.

"It's been a while," Stella said, forcing calm into her voice.

"Congratulations on your improved health," Damian replied sincerely.

Stella gave a faint laugh. "Just temporarily not dying yet. Damian, I wanted to ask—do you still have that divorce agreement?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Yes. Mr. Roland never revoked the authorization." Damian paused. "You...agree to the divorce now?"

"Yes. The sooner, the better." Stella tightened her grip on the phone. "I'll pay extra for your services."

Damian's voice dropped to a whisper. "Ms. Valentine, it's not that I don't want to help...but I can't see Mr. Roland right now."

"Why not?"

"I know too much." Damian laughed bitterly. "Someone told me about Martha Clementson's situation..."

Stella's pupils constricted. "Lily Savigny threatened you?"

"...I can mail you the divorce papers. But I'm afraid that's all I can do."

After hanging up, Stella felt icy cold all over.

So Damian's sudden disappearance was also Lily's doing.

"Still no luck?" Joy asked worriedly.

Stella looked out the window. "Another year then...if I can last that long."

......

New Frontier Group CEO's Office.

Vincent Astor frantically searched for Felix Roland's whereabouts but found nothing.

The phone rang abruptly. The receptionist sounded panicked. "Mr. Astor! Ms. Savigny and her mother are forcing their way upstairs!"

Vincent's temple throbbed.

Ever since his boss started his "vigil" outside the hospital, Lily had been causing daily scenes at the company.

The elevator dinged open.

A middle-aged woman with heavy makeup stormed in on high heels, her red nails pointing at Vincent's nose. "You must be Adrian's assistant? How dare you stop me!"

Vincent suppressed his anger. "Madam, this is a workplace."

"Enough! Get Adrian out here!" the woman shrieked. "He's been mistreating my daughter. He owes us an explanation today!"

Vincent's expression turned cold. "Mr. Roland isn't here."

"Not here? Where is he?"

"That's confidential."

The woman sneered. "Do you believe I can get you fired?"

Vincent remained composed. "That would require you actually being Mr. Roland's mother-in-law."
###Chapter 80: Never to Meet Again

Sophia Durand studied the young man before her with a dark expression. "You certainly know how to talk."

"You flatter me, madam. I'm just an employee." Vincent Astor turned to give instructions. "Ms. Lin, please serve our guests some coffee."

He addressed Sophia and her daughter. "You may wait in the reception area. I have work to attend to."

"Wait!" Sophia's sharp voice stopped him. "I have questions for you."

Vincent reluctantly turned back, maintaining a safe distance. "Go ahead."

Sophia gave her daughter a meaningful look. Lily Savigny immediately understood. "Mom, I need to touch up my makeup."

Vincent frowned and moved to follow, but Sophia's shrill voice halted him. "What? Are you going to follow my daughter to the restroom?"

"I was just concerned she might get lost."

"Spare me the fake concern." Sophia cut to the chase. "Is Adrian Roland keeping another woman?"

While her mother distracted Vincent, Lily quietly slipped to his desk. She quickly accessed his computer and found crucial information in the shopping records.

Baby supplies. Children's clothes. Formula.

The delivery address was clearly the Roland family estate.

Lily snapped photos of the evidence with her phone before silently returning to her mother's side.

Seeing her daughter's success, Sophia finally stood. "Since Mr. Roland isn't here, we'll return another time. Make sure he calls me back."

Vincent exhaled in relief. "I'll relay the message."

Outside the company building, Lily's voice trembled with excitement. "Mom, I found where that bastard child lives!"

"Control yourself." Sophia smirked coldly. "Once that little bastard disappears, Stella Valentine will never forgive Adrian."

"Should we go now?"

"Of course." A vicious glint flashed in Sophia's eyes. "I want Stella to watch her daughter die with her own eyes."

Two hours later, outside the Roland estate.

Light rain drizzled as the elderly butler, Benjamin Langley, played with little Luna in the gazebo. The baby giggled, reaching for a toy, her dimples faintly visible.

"That little bastard looks just like Stella," Lily spat through gritted teeth.

Sophia pulled a baby bottle from her bag. "Swap this when you get the chance."

"What's inside—"

"Pure grain alcohol." Sophia's smile turned sinister. "A one-month-old baby won't survive drinking this."

......

In the hospital corridor, the sound of a crying baby kept Stella Valentine awake.

She opened her door to find a flustered young father.

"Need help?"

The man looked embarrassed. "My wife is getting examined..."

Stella expertly checked the diaper. "It needs changing."

She demonstrated the process with gentle precision as she explained.

"You seem so young, but you're so good with babies."

"I have two children." Stella replied quietly. "My youngest just turned a month old."

The man looked surprised. "And your husband—"

"We're finalizing our divorce."

He immediately fell silent.

Back in her room, an unknown number flashed on her phone.

"Stella, want to see your daughter one last time?" Lily's icy voice came through. "117 Phoenix River Road. Come late, and you'll only collect a corpse."
###Chapter 81: All I Want Is My Daughter to Live

The phone's ringtone shattered the silence.

Stella Valentine's fingers trembled as she answered the call.

"Stella, I have your daughter." Lily Savigny's voice slithered into her ear like a venomous snake.

Stella's blood turned to ice. "Lily! If you dare lay a finger on Luna, I'll make you wish you were dead!"

"Tsk, so dramatic." Lily chuckled. "I'm just reminding you—if you don't come to the old house soon..."

The line went dead.

"Hello? Lily!"

Only the hollow dial tone answered her.

Stella staggered to her feet, her frail frame swaying in the hospital gown.

"Miss, do you need help?" A new father by the doorway asked with concern.

She ignored him, grabbing her phone and bolting for the exit.

"Patients can't engage in strenuous activity!" A nurse rushed to block her path.

"My daughter's in danger!" Stella's voice cracked. "Please, let me go..."

The nurse hesitated. "But your condition—"

"I'll sign a waiver!" Stella turned to the man. "Please..."

Understanding, he gently held the nurse back. "Let her go."

Stella plunged into the rain.

Fat droplets stung her face like needles.

The hospital entrance swarmed with people hailing cabs.

She waved desperately, watching taxis get snatched up one after another.

"Stella!"

Adrian Roland's voice cut through the downpour.

He pulled her under the awning. "What happened?"

She wrenched free. "Lily went to the old house! Did you tell her the address?"

"I didn't—"

"Who else knew where it was?!" Her eyes burned crimson. "If anything happens to Luna, I'll never forgive you!"

Adrian's face darkened. "Get in the car."

The vehicle was tomb-silent.

Stella clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

Through the rearview mirror, Adrian saw her soaked gown clinging to her frame, rainwater pooling in her slippers.

"Dry your hair—"

"Shut up!"

Twenty minutes later, tires screeched outside the old house.

Stella burst into the nursery.

"Little Star?" Old Benjamin turned in surprise.

"Where's Luna?"

"Just fell asleep..."

Stella lunged for the crib.

Little Luna lay still, cheeks flushed.

Her shaking hands checked every inch—no visible injuries.

But something acrid hung in the air.

"Benjamin, what did you feed her today?"

"Just formula and water..."

Stella snatched the bottle from the nightstand and twisted it open—

The pungent stench of alcohol assaulted them.

"This is liquor?!" Adrian grabbed it, face draining of color.

The old man's legs buckled. "Impossible! I filled it with water..."

Stella gathered her daughter.

The baby burned against her skin, unresponsive.

"How much did she drink?"

"H-half the bottle..."

They raced to the hospital.

Emergency lights glared.

"Alcohol poisoning." The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Immediate gastric lavage."

Stella's knees gave out. "No... other options?"

"Five more minutes and it's too late."

She bit her lip until copper flooded her mouth. "...Do it."

The procedure would damage Luna's delicate stomach.

But not doing it would kill her.

Dark spots danced in Stella's vision as she stumbled back.

Strong arms caught her.

"Let go!" She thrashed. "Adrian, you bastard!"

"I'll deal with Lily."

"How?" Stella laughed bitterly. "Like you 'dealt' with marrying her?"

His grip tightened. "This is different."

"I just want Luna safe!" Her scream tore through the corridor. "If she dies, I'll haunt you both!"

The OR lights burned like judgment.

Slumping onto the bench, Stella's tears blurred everything.

Her tiny Luna, so soft, so fragile...

Why did she have to suffer this?
###Chapter 82: You Don't Deserve Her

"Please verify guardian identity. We need a signature for the gastric lavage procedure."

Stella Valentine struggled violently to break free from Adrian Roland's embrace, but his arms remained immovable like steel clamps.

"Let go! I need to sign for Luna!"

Adrian took the pen with an impassive expression, signing the consent form with a flourish. "I'll sign."

He handed the completed form to the doctor. "Thank you."

The doctor hesitated. "Should we call the police? From what I overheard, the alcohol poisoning doesn't seem accidental. Could it be the nanny—"

"Call them."

Though reluctant to suspect the old butler, Adrian needed the truth.

Sirens soon pierced the night.

Benjamin Langley looked distraught during questioning. "I swear I don't know how liquor got into the bottle... I never drink, and there's no alcohol in this house! Even if there were, I'm not so senile I'd mistake water for liquor!"

Adrian leaned against the wall, observing coldly.

Benjamin had served the Roland family for decades with unwavering loyalty. Harming Luna was impossible.

"Sir, think carefully—did you notice anything suspicious this afternoon?"

"Suspicious..." The old man racked his brain before shaking his head.

Adrian showed photos of Lily Savigny and her mother. "Recognize them?"

Benjamin squinted. "Never seen them."

"Certain?"

"Master Adrian, we were in the garden all afternoon. We didn't encounter anyone."

The detective frowned. "That leaves you as the only person who handled the bottle."

Benjamin clutched his head in anguish. "Why would I hurt Luna...?"

The interrogation stalled until Benjamin suddenly recalled something. "Wait! I heard a loud noise in the nursery and went to check—I was gone maybe a minute... But that's not enough time to tamper with the bottle..."

True.

The narrow bottle neck would require at least five minutes to pour out water and replace it with alcohol.

"We'll keep investigating," the officer said, closing his notebook.

Adrian spoke abruptly. "Unless someone replaced the entire bottle."

Both Benjamin and the detective froze.

Swapping bottles would take thirty seconds.

"Collect fingerprints from the bottle."

"Citywide database matching takes a month—"

"I'll provide comparison samples tomorrow."

The detective's eyes lit up. "You have suspects?"

"Yes."

"Then we'll have results by tomorrow."

A heart-wrenching wail suddenly cut through the hallway.

Adrian sprinted toward the sound, taking his daughter from the nurse.

The nurse sighed. "Gastric lavage is hard on adults, let alone infants..."

Stella's heart shattered as tears flooded down her face.

"Breastfeeding would be gentler on her stomach these next few days."

"Understood."

"Let's move her to recovery."

Stella requested softly, "Can she stay in my room? I'm on the sixteenth floor."

The nurse blinked. "That's the oncology ward..."

"I have lung cancer."

"Oh..."

"Will it affect nursing?"

"Theoretically no..."

"Good."

Stella's eerie calm unsettled the nurse, who finally nodded. "I'll arrange it."

Stella kissed her daughter's tear-streaked cheeks.

Luna's cries gradually quieted into hiccuping whimpers at her mother's touch.

"Mommy will protect you..." Stella's voice broke. "For... as long as I can..."

The child's trusting obedience was a knife twisting in her chest.

"Stella..."

"Get out."

"I—"

She looked up with glacial eyes. "Adrian, this is the daughter I nearly died bringing into the world—who almost died today because of you. She stays with me now. Always."

Adrian closed his eyes in defeat. "Can I... ever see her again?"

"Only if you want to watch her die. You know what Lily is capable of."

"But I'm her father—"

"Are you?"

He froze.

"You're not worthy."

Each word struck like a hammer. "I'm begging you—never come near us again."

"..."

"Should I get on my knees to convince you?"

Adrian wiped his face. "That won't be necessary. I understand."

"No secret visits either."

"...Fine."

"File for divorce tomorrow. Give Lily her security, and Luna stays safe."

"...Fine."

Midnight found them in the recovery room.

Luna slept fitfully in Stella's arms, dried tears still glistening.

Stella gently wiped her daughter's face with a warm cloth, refusing to leave her side.

She dared not sleep.

Fear clutched her heart—that her child might vanish if she blinked.

Her phone vibrated.

[Sleep. I'll watch over her.]

Mr. Alistair's text unleashed fresh tears.

[I'm terrified.]

[She's safe with me. Rest—your daughter needs you strong.]

[But what if—]

[Stella, look outside.]

She raised her eyes to the starry sky.

[Right now, we're sharing this same constellation.]

The inexplicable message soothed her frayed nerves.

Of course. He was here.

[Trust me. Let me handle everything. Close your eyes, darling.]

[...Okay.]
###Chapter 83: I Can Trust You, Right?

Stella held little Luna tighter.

The faint scent of medicine still clung to the child. Instinctively, Stella curled her body, shielding her daughter with the softest part of herself. Only when she heard the steady rhythm of Luna's breathing did the knot in her chest loosen slightly.

Mr. Alistair had told her to rest, but sleep was impossible.

Her thoughts kept circling back to old Benjamin Langley.

She remembered Adrian once saying how kind the old butler had been to him since childhood. How could the man who secretly slipped candy into Adrian's schoolbag ever harm Luna?

And the method was so clumsy.

Last time at the old mansion, she'd watched Benjamin adjust the angle of Luna's bottle with painstaking care.

Her phone vibrated.

[Stella, turn off the lights.]

Her fingers trembled.

[Mr. Alistair, are you here?]

[If you don't sleep, I'll come supervise you personally.]

A smile tugged at her lips.

Moving silently, she first drew the curtains tight, then switched off the hallway light. Darkness swallowed the hospital room whole.

The door hinges creaked softly.

"Mr. Alistair..."

Warm fingers enveloped hers, pulling her into an embrace. He carefully avoided her injuries, his voice low. "I'm here."

The familiar scent of cedarwood wrapped around her.

She buried her face in his chest, breathing him in like oxygen.

"Checking so thoroughly?" He chuckled. "Afraid someone might impersonate me?"

She shook her head, her voice muffled against his shirt. "Your smell makes me feel safe."

His hand stilled in her hair.

"Have you decided on your answer?"

She felt his muscles tense.

"Yes." Her fingers twisted in his shirt. "Mr. Alistair, I'm willing."

Tears soaked through the fabric.

"Whether it's one month or one year..." Her voice broke. "I want to be with you."

His breathing hitched.

"Good." His arms tightened. "I'll stay with you. And the children."

She trembled with silent sobs, biting her lip to keep from waking Luna.

Suddenly, he swept her off her feet.

"Close your eyes." His voice was rough. "We're going to the rooftop."

She obeyed instantly.

"Stella." He paused on the stairwell landing. "Can I trust you?"

She nodded against his chest.

When the night air brushed her cheeks, she burrowed deeper into his arms.

"Let it out." He kissed her hair. "No one can hear you here."

Years of pent-up sorrow came flooding out.

Tears drenched his shirt, cooling in the breeze. Only when exhaustion claimed her did she finally still in his embrace.

"Sleep." His arms were steel bands around her. "I've got you."

Under the moonlight, two lonely heartbeats slowly synchronized.
###Chapter 84: The Power of Gentleness

"Stop calling! Stella needs rest!"

"No way? Who do you think you are? She doesn’t want to talk to you. Can’t you just be decisive for once? If you want a divorce, then get it over with. Stop dragging things out with your sentimental nonsense..."

Who was speaking?

Stella Valentine slowly opened her eyes, realizing she had been brought back to her hospital room at some point. Little Luna gazed up at her with wide, curious eyes.

Her heart melted. She pressed a soft kiss to her daughter’s cheek. The baby giggled instantly.

"Silly girl," Stella murmured, tapping Luna’s tiny nose. "You nearly gave Mommy a heart attack yesterday. You must never drink anything that smells strange again."

Luna babbled in response, wrapping her tiny fingers around Stella’s.

"Stella!" Joy Fairsprene abruptly ended the call and rushed over, her eyes red-rimmed. "Why does everything bad happen to you? I was only gone for half a day, and this happens..."

Judging by her friend’s puffy eyes, Joy must have cried before arriving.

"You’ve been working so hard for me," Stella said, squeezing Joy’s hand. "I’ve taken up too much of your time."

"Nonsense! My dad’s company is thriving now—orders are pouring in. He’s practically pushing me out the door to stay with you, our family’s savior."

"...Savior?"

"Absolutely! You saved me in college, and now you’ve saved our business. Stella, I’m sticking with you for life!"

Stella chuckled. "Then start by delivering my resignation letter to Mr. Valence. I don’t think I can return to work."

Joy’s face lit up. "Actually, he didn’t fire you! He approved remote work with full pay!"

Stella blinked. "Really?"

"Of course!" Joy beamed. "That obsidian jewelry set you designed for Madeline Valdemar? It went viral! At last night’s auction, every socialite went crazy for Unique Jewelry, demanding your designs!"

Stella froze.

As a designer, she had confidence in her work. The obsidian collection was striking, but she never expected such a sensation.

"Madeline won’t stop praising you. Your name is all over high society now. Even my mom’s friends are begging for custom pieces."

"What does your mother want?" Stella offered immediately. "I have nothing but time here."

"Are you kidding?" Joy gasped. "Unique Jewelry’s waitlist extends to next year! Mr. Valence limited you to one commission per month, and over twenty clients are already queued up."

The flood of good news left Stella dazed.

Back in Milan, her professors had praised her talent. Now that recognition had become reality, it felt surreal.

"Joy, I—"

"Stella." Joy gripped her hands tightly. "You have to stay strong. The world needs you—at least finish these commissions. For your children. For your admirers. Promise me?"

Stella’s nose stung. "Okay."

She understood Joy’s fear. While she’d made peace with her late-stage cancer diagnosis, her friend was clearly terrified.

"Oh!" Joy suddenly remembered. "That scumbag Adrian called about finalizing the divorce at the courthouse. He wanted to speak to you, but since you blocked him, he called me. I shut him down."

Stella pressed her lips together. "Good."

"Once the divorce is done, you’ll be free. You and Mr. Alistair can finally be together properly."

At the mention of him, Stella asked, "When did you arrive?"

"Around six this morning." Joy showed her phone. "See? I got this text at six. It must be from him. I came straight here."

The message bore Mr. Alistair’s signature thoughtfulness—gentle, considerate, ending with gratitude.

"Stella, he’s really something," Joy said earnestly. "Zachary doesn’t stand a chance. Gentleness is a man’s greatest charm."

Stella smiled softly. "Mm."

"Don’t believe those domineering CEO novels. In real life, kind and strong men are the most reliable. True masculinity isn’t about acting cool—it’s about protecting loved ones with tenderness."

Stella laughed. "Since when did you become so philosophical? Bad breakup?"

"Ugh, remembering my awful first love." Joy grimaced. "My ex acted like some novel’s tyrannical CEO—always forcing kisses, even saying ‘I own this fishing pond’ when we went angling. So cringey!"

Joy’s exaggerated disgust made Stella burst into laughter. Even Luna waved her tiny fists, giggling.

Then Stella recalled the nurse’s instructions to reduce Luna’s morning feeding.

Her phone buzzed.

[Already fed the baby—3 AM and 6 AM. Don’t worry.]

Joy peeked. "Him again?"

"Yes."

Reading this perfectly timed message, Stella sighed. She hadn’t been as attentive as Mr. Alistair.

[Thank you.]

[Listen to the doctors and rest well. I’ll visit tonight.]

[Okay.]

[Stella, your daughter is adorable. She takes after you.]

Putting her phone away, Stella gazed at the bundle in her arms. Luna’s eyes crinkled with joy, babbling happily.

This child was born smiling.

A girl who smiles often is blessed with luck.

Stella hugged Luna tighter, kissing her forehead. "Grow up healthy and happy. Mommy doesn’t care if you become a Roland heiress—just keep laughing like this. Then, even if I... I’ll be at peace."
###Chapter 85: Mr. Alistair's Identity

Stella Valentine never imagined she would have such peaceful days.

No more struggling to make ends meet.
No more worrying about illnesses.
Just quiet moments with her daughter.

Little Luna babbled in her arms, waving tiny hands like an energetic bunny.

"She's recovering remarkably fast." The doctor smiled after the checkup, gently touching Luna's cheek. "Those who survive great calamities are destined for happiness."

Stella kissed her daughter's forehead. This child had endured so much, yet still radiated joy.

Joy Fairsprene burst into the room, arms laden with shopping bags. "Stella, look what I got for Luna!"

Baby supplies piled onto the sofa. Stella shook her head. "Are you trying to buy out the entire mall?"

"You don't understand." Joy leaned in conspiratorially. "This little one is my lucky charm."

Stella chuckled. Once Joy set her mind on something, nothing could change it.

"Actually," Joy's expression turned serious, "there's something I need to ask you."

"Hmm?"

"About Mr. Alistair..." Joy hesitated. "Why does he refuse to show himself?"

Stella's fingers stilled. The question pricked like a thorn.

"He has his reasons," she murmured.

Joy sat upright. "Stella, I have a theory."

"What?"

"Either he's hideously ugly, or..." Joy lowered her voice, "...he has facial scars."

Stella's pulse jumped. That moonlit silhouette flashed in her mind—the sharp jawline, the straight nose. She'd never seen his left side.

"There's a businessman in Houston," Joy said carefully, "with a scar over his left eye."

Stella's breath caught.

"My ex-boyfriend." Joy gave a bitter smile. "Six years ago, I broke up with him to adopt a child who survived school bullying."

Stella stared at her friend, stunned. The revelation crashed like a boulder into still waters.

"You were married?"

"Divorced ages ago." Joy waved a hand. "That child is thriving now—got into Houston University."

Mr. Alistair's words echoed in Stella's mind: I hurt the woman I loved most. If that man was Joy's ex...

"He hates me." Joy's voice trembled. "Later, he flaunted his new girlfriend in front of me."

Stella's heartbeat accelerated. All clues pointed in one direction.

"Joy," she heard her own shaky voice, "who was your ex-boyfriend?"
###Chapter 86: Do You Miss Me, Stella?

Stella Valentine licked her dry lips and exhaled heavily.

"Julian Valois."

Her pupils constricted sharply. "Julian Valois of Valois Realty?"

Joy Fairsprene gave a slight nod. "Yes."

Valois Realty...

It was him...

Memories flooded back. On her eighteenth birthday, her father had thrown a lavish coming-of-age party at Houston Grand Hotel, inviting numerous business elites—including Julian Valois.

Back then, she'd been deeply in love with Adrian Roland. Her only impression of Julian came from Adrian's own words: "The only person in Houston who can rival me is Julian Valois."

"Victor Valois of Unique Jewelry is his younger brother," Joy continued. "That idiot abandoned the family business to pursue jewelry design, causing a huge rift. Julian cut off his funds. Despite his sharp tongue, Victor's decent at heart, so I secretly helped him out."

Stella's eyes widened in realization. "That's how you got me the referral to Unique Jewelry..."

"Exactly," Joy smirked mischievously. "Even though I never became his sister-in-law, he owes me this favor. But you got the job on your own merit—I just opened the door."

Stella's fingers trembled as she searched "Julian Valois."

The results showed dual degrees in architecture and business. After taking over Valois Realty, he'd rapidly expanded the empire. The string of zeros in his net worth made her dizzy.

"Stella?" Joy waved a hand before her eyes. "Don't overthink it. We haven't spoken in six years—we're strangers now. If he really is Mr. Alistair... I promise he's trustworthy."

Stella's brow furrowed.

This possibility caught her completely off guard.

Could Mr. Alistair be Julian Valois? Why would a man who'd once loved Joy choose her?

"I think he didn't want to burden you," Joy analyzed. "Given our history, he probably worried you'd feel uncomfortable."

"Do you still love him?"

"Absolutely not!" Joy sprang up indignantly. "Back then he dared to parade other women to provoke me. If it happened today, I'd curse him out. Men only slow down my career."

Stella fell silent.

If it really was Julian...

Those deliberate provocations might have stemmed from the bitterness of abandonment. And Joy's decisive departure had left this man broken ever since.

The entire afternoon, Stella's mind swirled chaotically.

When Joy left at dusk after a family call, only Stella and her sleeping baby remained in the hospital room.

Her phone vibrated.
[Has Joy left?]

This normally innocent question now felt like probing.

[She went home for dinner.]

[Her parents were always strict. I'll come keep you company tonight.]

[Mr. Alistair... you know Joy well?]

[Why do you ask?]

[Just curious.]

[Houston's a small place. It's normal to know about the Fairsprenes. Don't overthink it.]

She wasn't overthinking.
Her heart had already sunk.

From Joy's fragmented remarks, she pieced together the story: A headstrong Joy entered a sham marriage to adopt an abused child. Julian mistook it for betrayal. Their relationship ended over misunderstanding.

A love that could have been beautiful.

She should reveal the truth.

As night fell, the expected message arrived.
[Stella, turn off the lights.]

She drew the curtains tight and groped her way to the door.

Familiar arms enveloped her.

"Do you miss me, Stella?" Mr. Alistair's voice held laughter.

"......"

"Why so quiet?"

"...I missed you."

"I missed you too." His embrace tightened. "Now I look forward to nightfall most—because it means I get to see you."

Stella remained silent.

Sensing something amiss, he cupped her face. "What's wrong?"

"Mr. Alistair... do Joy and I... resemble each other?"

She held her breath, awaiting judgment.

He chuckled softly. "You share kindness, but your personalities differ completely. Joy's straightforward, you're gentle; Joy has a round face, yours is oval." A pause. "Did Joy say something?"

"No, just curious about similarities between close friends."

"Joy truly values loyalty," he said gently. "I asked her to accompany you, and despite being a late sleeper, she came first thing in the morning."

"She deserves to be cherished..."

"Fate can't be forced." A soft sigh. "Sometimes even lovers miss each other—simply because the timing's wrong."

Stella pulled away slightly, murmuring, "There's something you must know. Joy's marriage back then was to adopt a child suffering school bullying. It was purely platonic—nothing happened between them..."

He drew her back into his arms, fingers threading through her hair. "You think I'm Julian Valois?"

Stella froze.

"Then... are you?"
###Chapter 87: The Mysterious Call

Mr. Alistair remained silent for a long time.

His slender fingers gently brushed through her hair. "Stella, is my identity really that important to you?"

Stella Valentine tightened her grip on the blanket.

Was it important?

Of course it was.

"Mr. Alistair, if you really are Julian..."

"Hmm?" His voice lifted slightly, laced with amusement.

"Then please let Joy go." She mustered the courage to meet his masked gaze. "She deserves someone better."

Mr. Alistair suddenly laughed.

The sound carried a hint of bitterness.

He pulled her closer. "Stella, some relationships are like shooting stars. Beautiful as they streak across the sky, but never meant to stay."

Her heart clenched.

"But—"

"No buts." He cut her off. "Some people are just passing through. Like me and her."

Stella bit her lower lip.

She couldn't tell if he was admitting it or denying it.

The anesthesia hadn't fully worn off. Her thoughts moved sluggishly.

"You promised me." His voice softened unexpectedly. "No more questions about who I am."

Stella lowered her eyes.

"This is the last time." She whispered. "Because it's about Joy."

Mr. Alistair waited in silence.

"If you're Julian, give her closure." Stella took a deep breath. "If you're not, forget I said anything."

The room was so quiet their breathing filled the space.

"Stella," he spoke suddenly, "do you think people who've missed each other can start over?"

She froze.

"As long as they're alive, there's hope."

His body stiffened visibly.

"Like me," she smiled bitterly. "I wanted to take back Shi's Jewelry, but now..."

"Don't say it!" His arms tightened around her, panic creeping into his voice. "You'll be fine."

Stella shook her head gently.

Cancer didn't discriminate.

All she wanted now was to cherish the person in front of her.

"Mr. Alistair," she asked suddenly, "have we met these past few days? As your real self?"

This was her final test.

He buried his face in the crook of her neck.

"Stella," his voice was muffled, "I am Mr. Alistair. That's enough."

She didn't press further.

His kiss came without warning.

Starting at her forehead, then her eyelids, the tip of her nose, before finally claiming her lips.

It began tenderly, then grew feverish.

Stella could feel him losing control.

And the overwhelming love behind it.

She suddenly understood—the body never lies about love.

Just like with Adrian Roland.

Six years of waiting, only to end with divorce papers.

At least she still had Mr. Alistair.

As long as he wasn't Julian...

"That's easy!" Joy Fairsprene waved dismissively the next day after hearing the story. "Once you're better, we'll confront him together!"

She was meticulously peeling an apple.

The unbroken spiral of skin hung perfectly, like a work of art.

"See?" She proudly displayed her handiwork. "World-class skills!"

Stella couldn't help but laugh.

Joy always treated life's biggest problems as minor inconveniences.

She wished she could live that simply.

The phone rang abruptly.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

"Hello?"

"Miss Valentine, this is Julian Valois."
###Chapter 88: The Price of Truth

Stella's fingers trembled violently.

The name "Julian Valois" on her phone screen burned her eyes.

"Hello?"

The voice on the other end froze her in place.

That voice...

It was too familiar.

So familiar she almost believed Mr. Alistair was standing before her.

"Miss Valentine?"

"Y-yes, I'm here." She pressed a hand to her racing heart. "Hello, Mr. Valois."

A soft chuckle came through the line. "Just call me Mr. Valois."

Stella bit her lower lip.

Mr. Alistair.

Mr. Valois.

The two titles tangled on her tongue, nearly slipping out.

"I heard you weren't feeling well." Julian's tone was gentle, almost tender. "Are you better now?"

Stella glanced at Joy playing with Luna.

"Much better. Joy is keeping me company." She hesitated. "Would you like to speak with her?"

"No need." Amusement colored his voice. "I called specifically for you."

Her heart skipped a beat.

"I'd like you to design a jewelry set." Julian said. "For someone very important."

"Is it... for your girlfriend?"

"You could say that."

Stella clenched the bedsheet. "What style does she prefer?"

"What about you?" Julian countered. "What do you like?"

"Emeralds... and roses."

"Then that's settled." His decision was final. "No rush. Take your time with the design."

Her hands still shook when she ended the call.

"Stella?" Joy scooted closer. "Who was that?"

"Julian Valois." Stella stared at her phone. "He wants me to design jewelry."

Joy's eyes widened. "How did he—"

"I don't know." Stella shook her head. "Maybe he got my contact from the company."

Joy suddenly grabbed her hand. "Come on. I'm taking you somewhere."

Zachary's computer screen glowed blue.

Surveillance footage from the hospital entrance played frame by frame.

"This one." Zachary pointed. "Appeared at midnight two nights in a row."

Stella watched the black sedan, her breathing growing ragged.

Her phone vibrated.

[Stella, stop looking.]

Her fingers jerked. The phone clattered to the floor.

"What's wrong?" Joy bent to pick it up.

Stella snatched it first. "Let's go."

"We're about to identify the owner!" Zachary called after them.

But Stella was already dragging Joy out the door.

In the car, Joy couldn't hold back. "You're just giving up?"

Stella gazed at the blurring scenery outside.

"Sometimes ignorance is better."

Joy suddenly gasped. "Stella, look—"

A familiar figure hurried through the hospital entrance.
###Chapter 89: Chance Encounter

The car window rolled down slowly as the hospital entrance came into view.

Stella Valentine immediately recognized the familiar figure—Lily Savigny was walking briskly through the hospital doors.

"Screech—" Joy Fairsprene slammed on the brakes, bringing the car to an abrupt halt. "Ugh, that fake little saint. I’d love to know what she’s up to now!"

Little Luna Roland slept soundly in Stella’s arms. She gently pressed her friend’s hand. "Let it go. I’m happy with my life now. I don’t want to dwell on the past."

"No!" Joy shook off her hand, eyes blazing. "Even if you don’t care about Adrian Roland anymore, she stole your family’s legacy! Your home!"

Stella looked down at her daughter’s peaceful face.

If the Valentine family were still intact, Luna would have been a cherished little princess, not a child without a stable home.

"You stay here with the baby. I’ll go check it out—just a quick look, no trouble, I promise." Joy was already pushing the car door open.

"Joy!"

But her friend was already sprinting after Lily into the hospital.

Lily Savigny moved through the hospital alone, her expression tense.

She couldn’t wait any longer. Adrian had grown increasingly distant, and years of careful planning were on the verge of collapsing.

At least yesterday, he’d finally finalized the divorce with Stella.

This was her last chance.

Sunglasses, a mask, and a hat concealed her face until she entered the examination room and removed them.

The doctor initially thought a celebrity had walked in, but his expression fell when he saw her ordinary features.

"Doctor, I need ovulation induction shots."

"That requires preliminary tests first." The doctor frowned.

"Money isn’t an issue. I just need to get pregnant as soon as possible." Lily lowered her voice.

The doctor set down his pen, smirking. "In all my years, I’ve never heard someone bribe me so bluntly."

"...I just want a child."

"Regular menstrual cycle? Normal marital relations?"

Lily nervously shut the door, her voice trembling. "I... had a miscarriage. It’s hard for me to conceive now. IVF is fine—I can pay any amount."

"We don’t have IVF licensing here." The doctor shook his head.

"Then the shots! My friend got pregnant right after taking them!"

...

Outside the hospital, Stella fidgeted anxiously.

Joy was impulsive. If she confronted Lily, things could go badly.

"Knock knock"—the car window tapped.

"Ma’am, your car is taking up two spots." The parking attendant gestured to the long line of vehicles behind them. "Could you move, please?"

Stella panicked. "I... I don’t know how to drive. My friend will be back soon."

"How long is that gonna take?" The attendant scowled. "This is an emergency lane!"

Horns blared in frustration.

"Miss Valentine?"

A smooth, cultured voice suddenly spoke.

Stella turned and met a pair of warm, jade-like eyes.

Behind gold-rimmed glasses, the man stood impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his tie perfectly knotted—every inch the refined aristocrat.

"I’m Julian Valois."

Stella’s pupils contracted—why was he here?

"Are you the car owner’s friend?" The attendant pressed. "Move it now! There’s an emergency patient waiting!"

Julian glanced at Stella. "Need help?"

His tone, his demeanor—everything about him reminded her of Mr. Alistair.

"Miss Valentine?"

"Y-yes, please." Stella snapped out of her daze.

Julian gave a polite nod and smoothly parked the car in a proper spot.

In the confined space, they sat barely half a meter apart.

When he glanced at her through the rearview mirror, he caught Stella stealing a look at him.

"Miss Valentine."

"Mr. Valois, thank you for today."

"Don’t mention it." His gaze softened as it landed on Luna. "Your daughter is lovely."

"Thank you."

"Forgive my forwardness..." Julian hesitated. "May I hold her?"

Stella tensed instantly.

No matter how much he resembled Mr. Alistair, he was still a stranger.

"My apologies, that was inappropriate." He immediately withdrew the request.

"She’s asleep..." Stella murmured.

Julian nodded in understanding. "I should’ve thought of that. Are you here at the hospital for...?"

"Just accompanying a friend." She deflected. "And you, Mr. Valois?"

"Personal matters." He sidestepped the question, then asked gently, "Does the wound still hurt? Try to avoid painkillers—they’re not good for your nerves."

Stella’s head jerked up. "How did you know what medication I’m taking?"
###Chapter 90: Truth and Lies

The air inside the car turned suffocating.

Stella clenched the hem of her dress, her nails digging into her palms. She regretted exposing the unspoken lie between them.

Why couldn't she have pretended ignorance a little longer?

"Miss Valentine." Julian's voice remained gentle as jade. "Some lies are told for protection. Some deceptions come from kindness."

Stella lowered her lashes. "I'm sorry, I—"

"No apologies needed." He shook his head slightly. "No matter who I am, I would never hurt you."

She could only nod.

"Joy will be back soon. I should go." Julian paused. "Remember to return to the hospital."

As the car door closed, Stella watched through the window as his tall figure walked toward a black Maybach parked nearby.

Only when the car disappeared from sight did she finally exhale.

"Stella!" Joy flung the door open with her usual energy. "I told you it was her!"

Stella rubbed her temples.

"What's wrong?" Joy leaned closer. "I brought big news! One good, one bad. Which do you want first?"

"The bad one."

"Lily might be pregnant!"

Stella's lips twitched. "Oh."

"That's all?" Joy's eyes widened. "If she's really carrying that scumbag Adrian's child—"

"Not my concern." Stella cut her off. "I don't care about their affairs anymore."

Joy pouted. "Fine. Do you want to hear the good news?"

Stella lifted her gaze.

With a dramatic flourish, Joy pulled out her phone and played a recording. Lily's deliberately hushed voice came through: "...had a miscarriage before...hard to conceive again..."

The audio cut off abruptly.

"Well?" Joy arched an eyebrow triumphantly. "I told you I saw her at the OB-GYN! Who knows how many abortions she's had—"

A realization struck Stella. "Then that time she miscarried..."

"Faked it!" Joy scoffed. "Didn't Adrian take her abroad for a whole year? Perfect timing to avoid the paternity test."

Stella smiled bitterly.

Trust worked that way—when given, everything seemed perfect; when broken, every flaw became glaring.

"I'm sending this to Adrian right now!" Joy tapped excitedly at her screen.

"Don't." Stella stopped her hand.

"Why not?"

"Let them get married." Stella stared out the window. "Let love turn to resentment. Let the first love become a stain on the sheets... That's the best revenge."

Joy blinked. "English, please?"

"Trash belongs in the dumpster." Stella chuckled darkly. "Keeps them from contaminating others."

Joy burst out laughing. "Should've said that sooner!" She pocketed her phone. "We'll keep this as leverage. Let's see how long their 'happiness' lasts."

Stella nodded.

"By the way," Joy suddenly turned serious, "about your future—"

"I'll take good care of the children." Stella interrupted, her gaze drifting into the distance. "And then..."

Find a quiet place to see the stars one last time.

[Don't overthink, Stella. It hurts me to see you like this.—Mr. Alistair]

Stella whipped her head around.

Through the swaying tree shadows, the black Maybach that should have left still idled nearby.

The license plate number matched perfectly.
###Chapter 91: The Truth Emerges

The engine roared as Joy Fairsprene slammed the accelerator. The car shot forward like an arrow.

"That Lily Savigny is a bitch!" Joy smacked the steering wheel in frustration. "Don't worry, Stella. We'll go find Mr. Alistair and get answers!"

But Stella Valentine's gaze remained fixed on the rearview mirror.

The black Maybach still sat parked, its window slightly lowered, revealing the driver's sharp profile.

"Joy."

"Hmm?"

"What color is Mr. Alistair's car?"

Joy frowned in thought. "Zachary said it was black... some fancy model like May—"

"Maybach?"

"Yes!" Joy turned in surprise. "How did you know?"

Stella's fingers tightened unconsciously.

She didn't just know the car model.

She knew exactly who was behind the wheel.

"Stella?" Joy glanced at her worriedly. "You look pale."

"It's nothing." Stella forced a smile. "Probably just post-surgery fatigue."

Joy pulled up to the hospital entrance and hurried to open her door.

"Want me to come with you?"

"No need." Stella adjusted baby Luna in her arms. "You go ahead."

Luna giggled, tiny fingers grasping a strand of Stella's hair.

That smile... it looked just like Mr. Alistair's gentle expression.

The realization startled her.

"Miss Valentine?" A nurse peeked in. "Visitors claiming to be family."

Stella tensed. "Who?"

"An older couple. Said they're your uncle—"

Before she could finish, Victor Lefèvre barged in.

"Stella Valentine!" His face twisted in rage. "Why did Adrian Roland withdraw funding?!"

Stella smirked coldly. "Ask your daughter."

"You—!" Victor raised his hand.

"Try it." Stella met his glare. "Victor, remember who holds majority shares."

Her phone buzzed.

[Don't be afraid. On my way.]

Stella typed back: [Not necessary.]

The phone rang instantly.

"Mr. Alistair?"

"Five minutes." His voice carried urgency. "Don't provoke them."

Stella inhaled deeply. "Mr. Alistair... or should I call you Julian Valois?"

Dead silence on the line.

"I saw your car." Her voice softened. "Right outside the hospital."

Beep—

The dial tone cut off as the door swung open.

Julian Valois strode in, positioning himself between her and Victor.

"Let me handle this," he murmured.

The familiar scent of his cologne enveloped her.

Stella stared blankly at his broad shoulders.

"CEO Valois?!" Victor gaped. "Why are you—"

Julian cut him off coldly. "Outside. Now."

Sophia Durand tugged Victor's arm. "The CEO is right, let's discuss this—"

As the door clicked shut, Stella caught Julian's hushed whisper:

"Stella... I'm sorry."
###Chapter 92: Intoxicated Night

Security arrived to find Sophia Durand desperately clutching Victor Lefèvre's sleeve.

Julian Valois cast a complicated glance at the hospital bed before leaving. His Adam's apple bobbed several times before he finally murmured, "Get well soon."

"Who was that scary-looking man?" A young nurse whispered, patting her chest.

"Definitely not a decent person. Look at that nouveau riche attitude."

"Poor Ms. Valentine..."

"But that gentleman earlier was so handsome! Is he her boyfriend?"

"Don't talk nonsense. The man outside the operating room last time was her husband."

"But I've seen him at the hospital entrance several times..."

"My God, you remember that clearly?"

"With a face like that, how could anyone forget?"

The nurses giggled as they left, carefully closing the door behind them.

The room plunged into silence.

Stella Valentine stood by the window holding her daughter, watching Julian and Victor confront each other in the garden.

Julian stood casually with hands in pockets while Victor gestured wildly toward the hospital.

She didn't need to guess what they were arguing about.

Twenty minutes later, Victor stormed off in his car.

Julian pulled out his phone and sent a message.

Her phone vibrated immediately.

[Handled.]

Outside, Julian pocketed his phone and walked toward the black Maybach.

As the car drove away, her heart sank with it.

...

Midnight found Lily Savigny anxiously biting her nails.

The pain from ovulation induction shots still lingered in her abdomen.

The doctor's words echoed in her ears: "Your uterine lining is too thin. The chances of pregnancy are extremely low..."

She hurled a pillow across the room.

How could Stella use children to stage a comeback?

Her phone screen lit up and dimmed repeatedly—still no reply from Adrian Roland.

Click.

The sound of the door unlocking made her spring up.

Adrian stumbled in reeking of alcohol.

"Who are you?" He squinted at her.

"It's me, Lily!" She rushed to support him. "This is our home."

"Lily..." He repeated dully before shoving her away. "No...I need to find Stella..."

"She's already divorced you!"

"Divorced?" Adrian froze, his eyes bloodshot as he lurched toward the door. "I need the rooftop...Stella's waiting..."

The rooftop wind cut like knives.

Adrian staggered around searching for a phantom.

Lily watched coldly until exhaustion overcame him.

"Adrian," she said softly, "Stella has someone new."

His back went rigid.

"Julian Valois from Valois Group." She pressed against him. "The project you withdrew funding from..."

"Billions aren't small change." His voice turned alarmingly clear.

"But that's my father—"

"So?" Adrian spun around with a sneer. "Trading you for billions?"

Lily turned pale.

"You pushed Martha down the stairs." He advanced step by step. "The 4S store 'coincidence' was staged. And..."

He suddenly grabbed her chin. "Did that child ever really exist?"

Lily's pupils contracted.

"Talk!" His roar echoed across the rooftop. "Or I'll bankrupt Victor Lefèvre and make you pay for Martha's life!"
###Chapter 93: Mr. Alistair, Also My Husband

Lily Savigny's nails dug deep into her palms.

She didn't dare meet Adrian Roland's bloodshot gaze.

If the truth came out, everything she'd carefully built would crumble.

The ringing phone came at the perfect moment.

She practically fled to the corner to answer. "Hello?"

"Lily, it's Felix." The voice belonged to the 4S shop employee.

Her chest tightened. "What is it?"

"Mr. Roland is investigating the repair records from that car accident six years ago. I remember you handled it..."

Her breath hitched. "The documents are lost."

"What? How could such important files—"

"I said they're lost!" Her voice rose sharply before she hastily lowered it. "Sorry, I've been emotional lately."

Felix hesitated. "You seem... resistant to this matter?"

Lily's eyes darted. Her tone instantly softened. "I'm pregnant. The doctor says the fetus is unstable..."

"Oh! Don't worry, I'll tell Mr. Roland we couldn't find anything."

Hanging up, she exhaled in relief.

When she turned around, the rooftop was empty.

......

Night deepened.

Stella Valentine stood by the window, watching the black Maybach enter the hospital grounds.

Her phone screen lit up: 【I'm here】

Her fingers trembled slightly as she replied: 【Okay】

The room plunged into darkness.

The sound of the turning lock was unnervingly clear.

A familiar scent enveloped her as she was pulled into warm arms.

"Stella." His voice was rough.

She parted her lips, unsure what to call him.

"Call me Mr. Alistair." He read her hesitation. "I like hearing you say it."

"But—"

"Mr. Alistair has another meaning." His lips brushed her ear. "Husband."

Her entire body stiffened.

"Today's incident with Victor won't happen again." His arms tightened, carefully avoiding her injuries.

"Adr—"

Feeling her tension, she corrected herself: "Mr. Alistair."

His low chuckle vibrated against her. "Sounds perfect."

"Your cologne is too strong."

"I'll use less tomorrow." He kissed her hair. "Is Luna asleep?"

At the mention of their daughter, Stella's voice tightened. "Can you find out who hurt her?"

"You know the answer." He sighed. "There are no cameras near the estate."

"So Lily gets away with it?" She shoved him away abruptly. "Martha, your parents, my father—"

"Stella." He captured her shaking hand and pressed it to his chest. "I swear you'll see them pay with your own eyes."

"How?"

"Give me time." Suddenly he scooped her up. "The moon is beautiful tonight. Let me show you the stars."

Striped shadows from hallway lights fell across his mask.

Studying his tense jawline, she whispered, "What if... just what if I don't have much time left?"

"Then we'll treat every day like the last." He looked down at her. "Starting now—focus on the stars."

Night wind tousled her hair.

His embrace was so warm it made her want to cry.
###Chapter 94: He Is Nobody, Just Mr. Alistair

Sunlight filtered through the curtains as I slowly opened my eyes.

The familiar antiseptic smell told me I'd woken up in a hospital room again.

Little Luna curled against me, sleeping soundly. I gently stroked her soft hair, noticing how my sleeping position had been adjusted to protectively cradle her.

Mr. Alistair must have done this.

I rubbed my itchy nose. His cologne last night had been overpowering, and its sharp scent still lingered faintly.

Getting up, I pushed open the window to let the morning breeze carry away the traces of his fragrance. Luna was too young for such strong scents.

The sudden ringtone startled me.

The name flashing on screen was no surprise.

"Mr. Valois?"

Engine noises rumbled through the phone as Julian Valois spoke cheerfully: "Miss Valentine, did you sleep well last night?"

I remembered counting stars in his arms until I drifted off—a rare dreamless night.

"Very well."

His low chuckle vibrated through the receiver. "Good. Proper rest is the best medicine."

"And you?"

"I slept wonderfully." His tone shifted abruptly. "About that custom jewelry set—any design ideas yet?"

The forced subject change was obvious.

I understood his intention—Julian Valois by day, Mr. Alistair by night. He wouldn't blur those lines.

"Could you describe the recipient? Age, personality, usual occasions..."

"You decide." His voice softened. "I trust your taste."

Words failed me.

"No rush," he added lightly. "Just making conversation. You sound better—that's what matters."

"I'm fine."

"Call me anytime."

"Alright."

"Goodbye."

"See you tonight."

I immediately regretted it.

After a brief silence, his deep laugh came through. "If that comforts you, think what you will."

"...Thank you."

"No need." A pause. "I'll remember about the cologne."

Hanging up left me unsettled.

If he chose to maintain this facade, I wouldn't pry. Yet his history with Joy Fairsprene still pricked at my heart like a splinter.

That splinter was yanked out unexpectedly—Joy visited that afternoon with her "boyfriend."

My jaw nearly dropped when I saw him.

"He's...really your boyfriend?"

Joy clung to the man's arm affectionately. "Surprise!"

No surprise—just sheer shock.

Harry Vance, the A-list actor before me, constantly appeared in tabloids with a different woman each month. Though not a fan, even I recognized him.

I managed a stiff nod.

Harry smiled easily. "Miss Valentine, Joy's told me so much about you."

"Excuse us—I need a word with Joy."

Dragging her into the bathroom, I hissed: "Are you serious? How long have you known him?"

"Met at a party last week." She waved dismissively. "Relax, it's fake—just to get my parents off my back."

"But this is too..."

"Zachary Ellison and his friends won't cut it!" She rolled her eyes. "If I picked them, my parents would start planning weddings immediately."

I bit my lip.

"Stella, after seeing what happened between you and Adrian, I'm done with marriage." She patted my shoulder. "Harry's a celebrity—we can drag this out for twenty years. Perfect!"

Her words stung.

"But his reputation..."

"Mutual benefits." She winked. "I brought him to show you—I won't interfere with you and Julian."

Tears pricked my eyes. "Joy..."

"Sisters before misters!" Grabbing the water pitcher, she headed out. "Be right back."

Returning to the room, I found Harry scrolling through his phone. He offered a polite smile.

The silence grew suffocating.

Then the door burst open.

"That was fast—" I turned, then froze.

Adrian Roland stood in the doorway, his glare slicing toward Harry as his lips curled coldly. "Stella, quite the popular divorcee?"

"He's not—"

"Harry Vance." Adrian strode forward, extending a hand. "Visiting my ex-wife?"

Harry shook it blankly. "Yes—"

The sentence ended with Adrian's fist smashing into his face—
###Chapter 95: Your Regret Means Nothing to Me Now

Adrian's fist connected with Harry's face before he could react.

Harry staggered back, knocking over a vase behind him.

"Mr. Roland, what—"

"Stay away from Stella." Adrian's voice was glacial.

Stella rushed forward and grabbed his arm. "Adrian!"

"You're the one acting insane!" His eyes burned with fury. "First Julian, now this playboy—"

"We're divorced!" Stella cut him off.

Adrian's throat worked. "I regret it."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "So what? Should I grovel in gratitude?"

"The children need us—"

"They need me." She took a step back. "Where were you when Luna was sick? Where were you when Ethan got bullied?"

He reached for her. "Let me make it right—"

Stella slapped his hand away.

"Do you remember that blue dress I wore at eighteen?" she asked suddenly.

Adrian froze. "The one your father gave you?"

"Yes. I cried over it for a week." Her gaze drifted to the window. "But even if it returned now, it wouldn't fit anymore."

She turned back to him. "Just like you."

His face went pale.

"Mr. Alistair found me when I was dying in the ICU." Her voice was soft. "You were helping Lily pick her wedding dress."

Joy burst in with a water pitcher. "You bastard!"

She planted herself in front of Stella like a bristling cat.

"He's my boyfriend!" She pointed at Harry's swelling cheek. "Who gave you the right to hit him?"

Adrian sneered. "The way he looks at Stella—"

"Psycho!" Joy hurled a pillow at him. "She has Julian now. Nobody wants your pathetic regrets!"

Stella gently stilled her friend's hand.

"Adrian," she said calmly, "delayed affection is worthless."

The room plunged into silence.

Adrian's knuckles whitened before his hands fell limp at his sides.

As he turned to leave, he heard Stella tell Joy, "Ask Julian to dinner tonight."

The door slammed shut with a deafening crash.
###Chapter 96: I Won't Give Up

Harry Vance finally gathered his courage to speak. "Mr. Roland, there's been a misunderstanding..."

Adrian Roland frowned deeply, remaining silent.

Joy Fairsprene waved impatiently. "Just leave already. Stella needs rest."

Adrian didn't budge, his gaze locked onto Stella Valentine.

Joy stomped her foot in frustration and pushed him. "Are you leaving or not?"

But Adrian stood firm as a mountain.

She gritted her teeth. "Since when does the great Mr. Roland resort to being a nuisance? Stella is already divorced from you!"

"No."

The single word rolled off Adrian's tongue with unsettling calm.

Stella whirled around, disbelief flashing across her face.

Joy's eyes widened. "No divorce? That's impossible..."

"Cooling-off period." Adrian's intense stare never wavered. "Stella, we're still married."

Her lips trembled. The words struck like lightning.

"Focus on recovering. Victor Lefèvre won't bother you again."

A nurse hurried over. "Sir, please keep it down."

Adrian nodded. "Stella, I won't give up."

With that, he turned and left.

Stella's legs gave out, and she collapsed onto the bed.

Joy rushed to steady her. "Damn this cooling-off period! Never getting married is clearly the smarter choice."

With shaking hands, Stella dialed Hugo Merovingian.

"Stella?"

"Mr. Merovingian, about the divorce..."

"I was just about to tell you. There's a mandatory one-month cooling-off period before finalizing it."

A bitter laugh escaped her.

Fate always seemed to side with Adrian.

"I have to return to the States in ten days. You'll need to handle the rest yourself."

Her heart sank. "Thank you for your help."

"Ethan keeps asking for you. A child needs his mother, even if just for a visit..."

Stella's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

"Stella?"

"...I'll think about it."

Hanging up, she closed her eyes in exhaustion.

Harry tugged Joy's sleeve. "Let Ms. Valentine rest."

Joy hesitated. "Stella, should I stay?"

"No."

Once alone, silence reclaimed the hospital room.

Her phone buzzed.

[Are you okay?]

[Managing.]

[Adrian came to see you.]

Her fingers froze mid-reply.

[Do you still love him?]

[No.]

[What about me?]

[Mr. Alistair, when can we meet?]

[Not yet.]

A self-deprecating smile curved her lips.

Everyone kept telling her to wait.

The divorce. The truth. Even her dwindling lifespan.

[I'm tired of waiting.]

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Stella, I'm downstairs." Julian Valois' voice sounded hoarse.

Her pulse jumped. "Did you see Adrian?"

"Yeah."

"Why bother?"

He sighed. "Some things can't be explained yet."

"Not even in daylight?"

"The truth is more complicated than you realize." His tone darkened. "Someone has sacrificed too much for you..."

Silence stretched between them.

"Let's get dinner. That underwater restaurant?"

"I'm exhausted."

"Then I'll wait."

The call ended, and Stella drifted into uneasy sleep.

Adrian's figure haunted her dreams, along with Mr. Alistair's shadow—but Julian was conspicuously absent.

A ringing phone startled her awake.

"Stella!" Joy's excited voice crackled through. "The Maybach's license plate from the surveillance footage doesn't match Julian's!"

Stella bolted upright. "What?"

"Julian might not be Mr. Alistair, but they must know each other! I'm tracking all Maybachs in the city now!"
###Chapter 97: You Should Get Pregnant Too

The crystal chandelier's glow cast shadows across Sophia Durand's sullen face in the Sun family villa.

"Did Adrian really say that?" Her teacup slammed onto the coffee table with a sharp crack.

Lily Savigny curled into the sofa corner, her smudged mascara creating dark streaks. "He rushed straight to the rooftop to find Stella... Mom, he still can't let that woman go!"

"Stop panicking," Sophia sneered. "Men are all the same. His obsession with Stella is only because of that child."

"That bitch has nine lives!" Lily ground her teeth. "Even that high-proof alcohol couldn't kill her!"

Sophia narrowed her eyes. "If only you could conceive..."

"Mom!" Lily suddenly clutched her hand. "What if we try another overseas clinic?"

"Can you leave now?" Sophia shook her head. "The moment you're gone, Adrian will run straight to Stella."

Lily's nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"Your body is so peculiar," Sophia muttered. "Just a few miscarriages and you're infertile? Those nightclub girls have abortions a dozen times and still pop out babies..."

"It's those disgusting old men's fault!" Lily shrieked. "Ugly bastards who promised divorces, then vanished when I got pregnant!"

Sophia patted her daughter's hand. "I should've had you target unmarried men like Adrian from the start."

"Back then he only had eyes for Stella!"

"But you still got him in the end, didn't you?" Sophia's lips curled triumphantly. "Listen—a woman's career means nothing compared to a good marriage. Look at Aunt Liu, killing herself at work while I enjoy spas and shopping..."

Lily's gaze flickered. "What do we do now? Maybe..." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "We could take care of Stella's child—"

"Fool!" Sophia leaned in sharply. "Stella has Julian Valois protecting her now. Brute force won't work." She produced a small vial from her purse. "I have a better plan..."

As Sophia whispered, Lily's pupils dilated. "This... would it really work?"

"Relax," Sophia smirked. "Once it's done, Adrian will never escape you."

New Frontier Group's executive conference room hummed with tension.

The video call had lasted forty minutes. Beads of sweat dotted the Black manager's forehead onscreen.

"Eric, ten points! That's our final offer!"

Adrian Roland stared blankly at the monitor, his knuckles rapping a hollow rhythm on the mahogany table.

Stella's resolute eyes haunted him.

Why?

Just one month—how had everything shattered so completely?

"Mr. Roland?" Vincent Astor murmured. "They've already conceded ten points..."

Adrian snapped back to reality. "Deal."

The screen went dark. Vincent exhaled. "Sir, Ethan has returned to Houston with Attorney Sullivan."

"When?" Adrian shot up from his chair.

"Recently..." Vincent hesitated. "Miss Savigny keeps visiting the office..."

Adrian's gaze turned glacial. "What does she want?"

"She claims..." Vincent swallowed. "To discuss wedding arrangements with you."
###Chapter 98: Enigmatic Night

Moonlight cascaded like liquid silver.

Adrian Roland froze abruptly, his pupils contracting. He seized Vincent Astor's tie and dragged him into the elevator.

"Mr. Roland!" Vincent stumbled, bracing against the wall. "What's wrong?"

"Them?" Adrian's voice was strained. "Besides Lily Savigny, who else?"

"Her mother." Vincent adjusted his crooked tie. "That woman's verbal assaults are truly..."

Ding—

The elevator doors opened.

Adrian strode toward the CEO's office, his dress shoes tapping a rapid rhythm on the marble floor.

"Recount that day's events." He halted at Vincent's desk. "Every detail."

Vincent swallowed hard. "Miss Savigny said she needed to use the restroom..."

"How long?"

"About half an hour." Beads of sweat formed on Vincent's forehead. "Her mother kept harassing me..."

Adrian retraced the path Vincent described. His gaze settled on the narrow gap behind the desk, his eyes darkening.

"Was the computer on?"

"I was handling your emails..."

Adrian closed his eyes briefly.

Everything made sense now.

Luna's alcohol poisoning. The exposure of the ancestral home. Those baby supply deliveries with suspicious addresses.

"Mr. Roland?" Vincent ventured cautiously.

"Ban them from the premises." Adrian's voice was icy. "I'll handle Luna's purchases."

Vincent nodded. "Did you drink last night?"

Adrian frowned.

"You smell of alcohol." Vincent hesitated. "Mrs. Roland always reminded you..."

The phone rang abruptly.

Unknown caller.

"Hello?"

"Adrian!" Lily's voice trembled with tears. "I know the truth about the car accident! Your parents' vehicle..."

Adrian's grip tightened. "Explain."

"Brake system failure..." Her breathing grew frantic. "Meet me. Six years of my youth—I want two million."

"Stay away from Ethan and Luna."

"Deal."

......

In the hospital room, Stella Valentine gazed at the neon lights outside.

Her phone screen lit up.

[Busy tonight. See you tomorrow.]

Her finger hovered over the screen before typing a single word: "Okay."

[We'll meet soon.]

Her heart skipped a beat.

[Sleep well. Dream of me.]

She smiled faintly. [I can't control dreams.]

[Then wait for me to enter yours.]

Night deepened. Stella curled protectively around the sleeping Luna and closed her eyes.

Perhaps it was better he didn't come. This time, don't make her wait too long.

......

The apartment was thick with cloying perfume.

"Adrian?" Lily emerged from the shadows, offering a glass of water. "To warm your stomach."

He took it and drained the glass.

"Now will you talk?"

Lily suddenly pressed against him, arms encircling his waist. "Kiss me one last time."

Dizziness struck. Adrian's vision blurred as heat flooded his body...
###Chapter 99: The Forbidden Passenger Seat

Adrian Roland's eyes snapped open.

His temples throbbed as if someone had hammered against them. Struggling to sit up, he realized he was only wrapped in a loose bathrobe.

Lily Savigny nestled beside him, her curves accentuated by black silk pajamas. Her cheeks were flushed, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes. "Adrian, last night—"

"Get out!" He shoved her away and staggered off the bed.

Clothes were scattered across the floor. He yanked on his shirt, fingers trembling with rage.

Lily wrapped her arms around him from behind. "I was wrong. Can't we start over?"

"You drugged me?" Adrian spun around and gripped her chin.

"I didn't—"

"Bullshit!" Veins bulged at his temples. "How could I not remember anything?"

Lily paled.

Her mother's words echoed in her mind: No matter what, you must get pregnant. It's your last bargaining chip.

"Consider it a farewell gift." She forced tears to her eyes. "I won't tell Stella."

Adrian sneered. "You lied about my parents just to get me here for this?"

"Wasn't she the same back then—"

"Shut up!" His gaze turned razor-sharp. "Don't you dare mention her."

Lily clenched the sheets. "Have you forgotten who killed your parents? That drunk driver from the Valentine family—"

"Enough!" He hurled a cigarette box against the wall.

Adrian lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. Through the smoke, Stella's pale face flickered in his mind.

"Luna's been sick often lately." Lily suddenly changed tactics. "Let me take care of her."

"Lily." He exhaled a smoke ring. "Drop the act."

"What act?"

"Martha. Luna." He crushed the cigarette. "Two million will be wired today. Let's end this clean."

The door slammed shut behind him.

Stella Valentine lay staring at the ceiling.

Mr. Alistair hadn't come last night. The realization tightened her chest.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains. She forced herself to rally—she couldn't meet Ethan looking like this.

Her phone rang just as she changed into the new outfit Joy had bought her. The white blouse and coffee-brown skirt made her reflection look like a high school student again.

"Stella?" Hugo Merovingian hesitated on the line. "You..."

"What's wrong?"

"Almost didn't recognize you." He chuckled. "Like a teenager playing dress-up."

Carrying Luna downstairs, Stella drew admiring glances from everyone.

Hugo's SUV waited outside. Her hand froze mid-reach when she went to open the passenger door.

"Take the front seat," Hugo said, rolling down the window.

Stella shook her head and slid into the back. "This seat... isn't meant for me."

As the car pulled away, she caught her flushed ears in the rearview mirror.

Some boundaries could never be crossed.
###Chapter 100: The Important One

Stella Valentine's movements were deliberate, leaving no room for ambiguity to grow.

Hugo Merovingian gave a helpless half-smile. "This car has never had a female owner."

"It will someday." Cradling her daughter, Stella spoke calmly. "Mr. Merovingian, I want to take care of Ethan myself when he returns."

"Your health—"

"The medical report shows I'm stable." She glanced down at the child in her arms. "I owe Ethan too much. I want to make it up to him."

Hugo studied her pale profile. "Raising two children alone will be exhausting."

"I can handle it."

"You're still as stubborn as ever." He sighed softly. "Stella, you're too hard on yourself."

The words felt eerily familiar.

For a fleeting moment, Stella recalled the fertility doctor who'd administered her ovulation shots saying the exact same thing.

Fate was a mischievous child, toying with her life. It dangled hope before crushing it mercilessly. Giving her a terminal diagnosis, then denying her a quick death. Now, with the tumor removed, her health improved daily against all odds.

She suddenly laughed.

"What's so funny?"

"The absurdity of fate."

"Spoken like a true artist. Always so poetic."

Stella shook her head. "This isn't about art."

"Then what?"

"Experience." She gazed out the window. "When your life becomes a rollercoaster, you'll understand better than I can explain."

The Hilton stood in the city's west, directly opposite the Houston Grand Hotel in the east.

Thirty minutes later, the black sedan pulled up at the hotel entrance. Hugo circled to the passenger side, opening her door with gentlemanly care, his hand shielding her head.

"Thank you."

"My pleasure."

He handed the keys to the valet. A flustered new attendant fumbled, causing the vehicle to lurch dangerously toward Stella.

"Look out!"

Amid shouts, Hugo tackled her to the ground. Instinctively shielding her daughter, Stella braced for impact—but Hugo's body absorbed the collision.

"Mr. Merovingian!"

Staff rushed to help them up. The panicked valet pleaded, "Please don't report me! It's my first day—"

Hugo's first concern was Stella. "Are you hurt?"

"I'm fine. Your arm—"

"Just a bump."

She noticed his blanched lips. "You need a hospital."

"What the hell is going on here?!"

An enraged voice cut through the commotion. Adrian Roland shoved through the crowd, roughly pushing Hugo aside. "Counselor Merovingian, has your divorce litigation extended to harassing my wife?"

Stella stared in shock. "Why are you here?"

"Had I not come, I'd have missed this touching scene." Adrian's eyes burned with fury. "So this is your so-called 'friend'?"

"Adrian!" Stella hissed, keeping her voice low. "Mr. Merovingian just saved my life!"

"By tackling you to the ground?"

"I was holding our child!" Trembling with anger, she spat, "Is this how little you think of me?"

Adrian's aggression faltered. "That's not what I meant—"

"Then you were following me?"

His Porsche was parked nearby. Adrian swallowed hard. "I needed to know who this 'Mr. Alistair' is—the one you're so devoted to."

Onlookers gathered. Stella refused to become gossip fodder. "We're leaving."

Adrian blocked her path. "Why are you at a hotel?"

"None of your business."

"You're injured—"

"No one hurts me except you." Her laugh was icy. "Sign the divorce papers in thirty days, or we'll settle this in court."

Turning to Hugo, she murmured, "I'm sorry you got dragged into this."

Hugo pressed a hand to his injured arm. "It's nothing."

"Get that checked at the hospital."

"Worried about medical bills?" His smile was wry. "Is that all you care about?"

Stella frowned. "What else?"

"Never mind." Hugo shook his head, then asked abruptly, "Who is Julian Valois? The one Adrian mentioned?"

The elevator doors slid shut between them. Stella's reply was barely audible.

"Someone very important."

Silence stretched as they stood side by side, both lost in thought.

Hugo noticed the subtle shift in her eyes when Julian's name was spoken.

But Stella's mind was elsewhere—would Mr. Alistair know about the accident? Would he contact her?

Her phone vibrated.

[Are you alright, Stella?]

Seeing the familiar number, the tension drained from her shoulders.

[I'm fine.]

[See you at our usual time tonight.]
###Chapter 101: With Him Here, I Fear Nothing

The elevator stopped on the 12th floor, and Stella Valentine's heartbeat suddenly quickened.

Hugo Merovingian's room was on this very floor.

Her arms tightened slightly around Luna.

Five years. This was the first time she could speak to her son while fully conscious.

Anticipation and nervousness tangled together.

"Ethan's been nervous since last night," Hugo chuckled. "You two have identical expressions."

Stella pressed her lips together, freeing one arm to reach for her son.

"But," Hugo paused, "Ethan looks so much like Adrian Roland."

Her throat tightened. "They're father and son."

"If Adrian demands visitation rights..."

"I know," she cut him off. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."

Hugo stopped at room 1208. The moment his fingerprint unlocked the door, it swung open from inside.

Ethan stood there in a navy-blue suit, eyes sparkling. "Uncle Hugo, is Mom here?"

The door opened fully. Mother and son locked eyes.

Tears instantly spilled down Ethan's cheeks. His lips trembled, speechless.

"He sleeps with your photo every night," Hugo murmured.

Stella knelt, arms open. "Ethan, I'm your mom."

"Mom!" He crashed into her embrace, sobbing. "I missed you so much..."

Her tears fell. "I missed you too... Do you hate me?"

Ethan shook his head violently. "Mom promised to come get me!"

"Yes, I'm here now." Her voice broke. "We won't be apart anymore."

Ethan pulled back suddenly. "Are you coming back to the States with us?"

"We're staying here," she wiped his tears. "Uncle Hugo has work too."

"Anywhere is fine as long as I'm with Mom." He clung to her. "You won't leave again, right?"

Stella hesitated.

"Is Dad coming?" Ethan peered around hopefully.

"Dad's busy." She changed the subject. "This is your sister, Luna."

Ethan approached cautiously. "She's so cute! She's smiling at me!"

Watching her children, warmth flooded Stella's chest.

Hugo helped her up. "Let's talk inside."

Ethan buzzed around like an excited bee, tending to his mother and sister.

"This kid's always acted like a little adult," Hugo smiled.

Stella pulled her son close. "Sit with Mom for a while?"

"Don't be scared, Mom." Ethan puffed out his chest. "I'll protect you and Luna."

She ruffled his hair, laughing. "Ethan is our hero."

"Can I hold Luna?"

In the bedroom, Ethan lay beside his sister, eyes shining. "She's so tiny."

"You were this small once too."

"Mom," Ethan asked suddenly, "did you make up with Dad?"

Her throat constricted. "It's complicated... But he'll visit you both."

"Dad must be a good person," Ethan said innocently. "Or Mom wouldn't have loved him."

Outside the door, Adrian leaned against the wall, heart splitting.

Did he deserve that title?

Soft breathing sounds came from the bedroom—both children asleep in each other's arms.

Stella gently closed the door to find Hugo frowning on the balcony, phone in hand.

"What's wrong?" she asked when he hung up.

"I must return to the States immediately. My client's situation worsened."

"Go ahead."

"But you and Ethan..."

"It's fine." Stella smiled. "With that very important friend here, I fear nothing."
###Chapter 102: Your Words Are Enough

"You're not fully recovered yet. How will you take care of two children?"

Stella Valentine had already considered this.

She gently stroked Luna's cheek, her gaze tender yet resolute.

"I plan to rent an apartment after discharge and hire a nanny. Ethan should start preschool soon, and Luna is still so young..."

Hugo Merovingian interrupted her. "I've booked this suite for a month. You can stay here temporarily."

"I'll transfer the payment to you."

"Stella..."

"Mr. Merovingian, you've already done too much for me."

He gave a bitter smile. "You always do this—afraid of owing me anything."

He stood and walked to the window.

"I understand. Even if you no longer feel anything for Adrian... you still wouldn't choose me." He turned, his expression calm. "But it's fine. Being friends is good too. Your heart already belongs to someone else."

Stella lowered her lashes. "Yes."

"Does he treat you well?"

"Very well."

"That's good." Hugo picked up his coat. "This time, be happy."

He left in a hurry, not even waiting for Ethan to wake.

When Ethan rubbed his eyes asking for Uncle Hugo, Stella could only soothe him softly.

[Coming back?]

Mr. Alistair's text suddenly appeared.

[Back where?]

[The hotel, or the hospital. Stella, I'm feeling jealous.]

She couldn't help but smile.

[Bringing the kids to a hotel isn't convenient.]

[Why?]

[Would you mind?]

[They're your children, so they're mine too.]

She remembered him once saying he wanted a child.

[Is that matter... finished?]

[It needs more time.]

[I'll wait.]

The phone suddenly rang.

"Stella..." Mr. Alistair's voice sounded choked. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For existing. I thought I'd be alone for the rest of my life..."

Her heart trembled.

"Mr. Alistair, if..."

"Hmm?"

"If my health allows..." Her voice grew quieter. "I'd be willing... to have your child."

Silence filled the line.

"Mr. Alistair?"

"Stella."

"Yes?"

"Your words are enough."

......

Late at night, Joy Fairsprene barged in, munching on an apple.

"I know all about high-society scandals!" She crossed her legs. "Everything's glamorous on the surface. Hey, why does Mr. Alistair always come at midnight and leave before dawn?"

Stella gently patted Luna. "Maybe... he doesn't want me to see his face."

"That's extreme!" Joy widened her eyes. "Only three or four hours of sleep? Unless..."

"Unless what?"

"He has another place to nap." Joy lowered her voice. "Could it be... he has another woman?"

Stella's hand stilled.

"Think about it," Joy leaned closer. "Rushing back before sunrise—maybe he's having breakfast with someone else..."

Luna suddenly began to cry.

Stella quickly picked up her daughter, but her heartbeat turned erratic.
###Chapter 103: A Fateful Arrangement

"Joy, could you do me a favor?"

Stella Valentine perked up immediately. "What is it? Just say the word!"

"Help me find an apartment. It doesn’t need to be too big—just enough for me and the two kids."

Joy Fairsprene understood. "Right, your uncle’s family has taken over the Roland estate. You’ll need a place after being discharged. Any specific requirements?"

Stella smiled softly. "Just something simple and cozy."

"Leave it to me!"

Joy worked with astonishing efficiency. The very next day, she had good news.

She drove over to pick up Stella and the children for a viewing.

The neighborhood was older but well-maintained, with lush greenery and a peaceful atmosphere.

"The landlord is amazing!" Joy led little Ethan inside by the hand. "Three bedrooms, a living room—120 square meters. There’s even space for a live-in nanny. The landlord is in a hurry to move abroad, so the rent is only $1,500. It’s practically a steal!"

Stella gave a small smile. "We really are lucky."

Her phone buzzed. A text from Mr. Alistair:
[Do you like the place?]

Stella typed back directly:
[Did you arrange this?]

[Yes and no.]

[Which is it?]

He sidestepped the question:
[The neighborhood is quiet but conveniently located. There’s a kindergarten two minutes away, a supermarket nearby, and the hospital is close.]

The hospital was within easy reach—medical care would never be a problem.

He had thought of everything.

Joy was still gushing. "The weirdest part? The landlord contacted me! Isn’t that strange, Stella? I didn’t even go through an agent, and he just called out of the blue..."

Stella asked quietly, "Did he say how he got your number?"

"No, he just said he had a place to rent..."

"Maybe it was fate."

Joy frowned. "This is too coincidental... Stella, maybe we should look at other options? Something feels off..."

Stella stopped her. "It’s fine. This place... was arranged by Mr. Alistair."

"Julian Valois?" Joy’s eyes widened. "He’s changed so much! It’s like he’s a completely different person!"

Stella walked through the apartment and noticed every detail had been meticulously considered.

The master bedroom had an enormous king-sized bed—even larger than the one at the hotel.

Her cheeks warmed slightly.

Though she had just given birth, the implication of that bed was unmistakable.

"Stella!" Joy came running over, holding a pack of diapers. "Look!"

They were Luna’s size.

Not just diapers—every baby essential was already stocked.

"I can’t believe a man could be this thoughtful. I’m jealous," Joy sighed.

The other room was filled with children’s supplies—Ethan’s schoolbag, stationery, even a piggy bank.

Joy gasped. "Anyone would think the kids’ real father prepared all this!"

Adrian Roland?

Stella shook her head. His tenderness had long been reserved for Lily Savigny.

"Stella," Joy said seriously, "stay with Mr. Alistair. He’s a better man than Adrian."

Stella nodded. "What about you?"

After all, Julian had once been Joy’s fiancé.

Joy burst out laughing. "Have you forgotten about Harry? That jealous puppy would throw a fit!"

"Joy, the arrangement is just for show. Don’t let it become real..."

"I know!" Joy cut her off. "I’ve got this under control."

Ethan came barreling into Stella’s arms. "Mommy! Is that our room?"

Stella held him carefully, ignoring the twinge of pain from her incision. "Do you like it?"

"I love it!" Ethan’s eyes sparkled. "How did you know Iron Man is my favorite?"

Stella smoothed his hair. "It wasn’t me..."

"Then was it Aunt Joy?"

Joy scoffed. "Not me. Your dad bought it."

"My dad?!"

"Not your birth father. Your other dad."
###Chapter 104: First Light

Ethan tilted his head, his eyes brimming with confusion.

He tugged at Joy Fairsprene's sleeve with his small hand. "Aunt Joy, will that daddy buy mommy pretty dresses like they do on TV?"

Joy crouched down and pinched his chubby cheeks. "Of course he will. He'll even take her out for candlelit dinners."

Ethan immediately cheered, spinning in place. "Then I'll pick the prettiest dress for mommy!"

Joy burst into laughter, pulling the little boy into her arms. "Stella, your son is such a sweetheart. He's going to break so many hearts when he grows up."

Stella Valentine watched her son's joyful silhouette, her eyes growing warm.

The pain Adrian Roland had inflicted on her was bone-deep, but these two children were the most precious gifts heaven had given her.

Perhaps this was fate's way of making amends.

Ring-ring—

The sudden chime of her phone shattered the moment.

"Stella, how are you settling into the new place?" Julian Valois's voice came through the receiver.

Unconsciously, Stella softened her tone. "It's lovely. We have everything we need."

"Good."

"Mr. Valois, I really can't thank you enough."

The rustling of papers sounded on the other end. "Don't thank me. The previous owner did all the decorating. When she heard you were moving in with children, she prepared all sorts of kid-friendly things."

A strange feeling flickered in Stella's chest. "Even the Iron Man merchandise?"

"What Iron Man?"

"It's Ethan's favorite—"

"Sorry, Stella," Julian interrupted abruptly. "I have an emergency meeting. I'll call you later."

The call ended abruptly.

Joy sidled up with a mischievous grin. "What's wrong? Did Mr. Valois get nervous?"

Stella ran her fingers along the edge of her phone. "He said the previous owner prepared everything."

"What a coincidence," Joy said dramatically, throwing her hands up. "Does this landlord read minds or something?"

The afternoon sun was gentle.

In the hospital corridor, the doctor held up a CT scan with a relieved smile. "Ms. Valentine, you're recovering well."

Joy was more excited than the patient herself. "Can she go back to work?"

"Yes, but she needs to rest." The doctor adjusted his glasses, then lowered his voice. "Also... avoid marital relations for now."

Stella's ears burned. "That... won't be an issue."

As they stepped out of the hospital, Joy suddenly smacked her forehead. "I almost forgot! Harry Vance's concert is tonight. As his fake girlfriend, I have to show up."

Stella chuckled. "Go on. Don't keep the superstar waiting."

Dusk settled in.

Stella stood at the base of her apartment building, gazing up at the lit window.

The moment her key touched the lock, the door swung open.

Strong arms pulled her into an embrace.

"Mr. Alistair?" she gasped.

A low laugh vibrated against her hair. "Who else would dare hold you like this?"

Only then did Stella notice the lingering sunset outside.

He came during daylight?

"The children—"

"Both asleep," his breath brushed her ear. "Ethan's jet-lagged, and Luna's out like a light."

A warm palm covered her eyes.

"Now it's not against the rules," his satisfied voice murmured. "Stella, I've dreamed of having a home like this."

Stella suddenly frowned. "Mr. Alistair, you're not wearing cologne today?"

His arms stiffened slightly.

"Didn't want to overwhelm the kids." He changed the subject. "Do you like the place? Ethan's Iron Man—"

"You claimed not to know about the Iron Man things on the phone," she pointed out sharply.

After a beat of silence, he suddenly swept her off her feet. "I'm tired. Come lie down with me."

Stella gasped, instinctively wrapping her arms around his neck.

Outside, the last sliver of sunset light grazed their entwined shadows.
###Chapter 105: I'm Human Too, Of Course I Feel Fear

His lips trailed downward slowly.

The warm sensation slid from her hairline, brushed past her brow, and lingered at the tip of her nose.

"Stella, may I?"

Backlit by the light, his silhouette enveloped her completely. She couldn't see his expression, only felt the strength of his arms around her.

"I..."

Mr. Alistair's voice suddenly dimmed. "Still not ready? It's alright. I can wait."

"It's not that I don't want to," Stella hurried to explain. "It's just..."

"Just what?"

Unresolved knots still tangled in her heart.

Memories of Julian Valois and Joy Fairsprene's past played vividly in her mind. Now Joy was entangled with that unreliable Harry Vance, and Stella couldn't help worrying. If she returned Julian to Joy, perhaps she'd be facilitating a perfect match.

By any measure, Julian was far more dependable than Harry. And besides... his heart had always belonged to someone.

"Mr. Alistair."

"Hmm?"

"You've denied being Julian Valois before."

The arms around her tightened abruptly. His response was evasive. "Does my identity matter so much to you?"

Stella bit her lip. "Just this last question..."

"If I am, will you push me toward Joy Fairsprene?"

She fell silent.

Mr. Alistair always understood her best.

"Joy has helped me so much," she sighed. "If you two—"

"Stella." He cut her off.

A warm palm covered hers, pressing it against his chest.

Through the thin fabric of his shirt, his heartbeat pulsed distinctly.

"Feel that?" He leaned in, breath grazing her ear.

Her earlobe burned. She wanted to pull away, but his grip held firm.

"Hmm?" He deliberately drew closer.

Flustered, she tried to create distance, but with a deft movement, he unbalanced her. She stumbled forward, collapsing against him.

"Mr. Alistair, you—"

"I what?"

You're terrible.

She whispered it silently in her heart.

"Don't curse me in your thoughts." His low chuckle vibrated against her. "I know everything."

Stella gasped and looked up, but all she met was darkness.

"You can read minds?"

"Only yours." His lips skimmed the corner of her mouth. "I know exactly what you're thinking."

"Then what if... I leave?"

"You promised you wouldn't." His voice dropped abruptly.

"I'm scared," she admitted softly. "I don't know who you are. I don't know where you are. If you disappeared..."

"I won't." His arms tightened. "Not unless you send me away."

"Adrian Roland said the same thing once."

Mr. Alistair paused. "I'm not him."

"He was young then." Her voice was barely audible. "Promises are always forgotten by those who make them and remembered by those who hear them."

"So I'm old now?" A sudden laugh escaped him.

"No! I meant—"

"I know." He pressed a kiss to her temple. "My Stella understands me best."

Those two words—my Stella—sent tremors through her heart.

Far more stirring than any rote "I love you."

"So... are you Julian Valois?"

"I'm just your Mr. Alistair."

"And during the day?"

"During the day..." He suddenly swept her up into his arms. "I'll hide very well."

In the bedroom, he sat on the edge of the bed with her in his lap, refusing to let go.

"I can't tell you the truth yet." His voice was muffled against her hair. "Because I'm afraid too."

"Mr. Alistair feels fear?"

"Of course." His whisper was barely audible. "Today's our housewarming. Look how bright the stars are."

Outside the window, the night sky glittered with countless stars.

September third.

0903—a date she would remember forever.
###Chapter 106: I Can Do Far More for You Than This

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains when the doorbell's sharp ring startled Stella Valentine awake.

"Mommy..." Ethan rubbed his sleepy eyes by her bedside. "Someone's at the door."

Her chest tightened. They'd only moved into this apartment yesterday—very few people knew the address.

Joy had gone to a concert last night and would still be asleep at this hour. As for Mr. Alistair...he was always cautious, never visiting unannounced in broad daylight.

"Sweetheart, go back to your room," she whispered. "Lock the door."

Only after ensuring Ethan's safety did Stella approach the entrance. The peephole revealed a kindly unfamiliar face.

"Miss Valentine? I'm your new nanny," came a cheerful voice.

Nanny? Stella frowned. She hadn't hired one.

"Who sent you?"

"A young gentleman. He mentioned you love chicken wonton soup and had me bring some."

Her heart skipped. Mr. Alistair.

Upon opening the door, the middle-aged woman introduced as Martha beamed, waving a food container. "That gentleman paid me ten times the usual rate!"

Martha...wonton soup... Stella's fingers trembled slightly. He remembered even these small details.

"Mommy!" Ethan suddenly darted out. "Luna wet the bed—"

Martha immediately set down the food. "I'll handle it! Miss Valentine, eat while it's hot."

Watching Martha's bustling figure, Stella momentarily saw her former nanny's shadow.

"Mommy," Ethan tugged her sleeve, "did our new daddy hire her?"

Stella crouched to his eye level. "We're not married yet. Just call him Uncle."

"What's Uncle's last name?"

The question froze her. She still didn't know Mr. Alistair's real name.

Returning to the dining area after washing up, Martha already held giggling Luna while Ethan playfully teased his sister.

"You're truly blessed, Miss Valentine," Martha remarked. "The gentleman even handles midnight feedings himself. In all my years as a nanny, I've never seen such a devoted man."

Stella's chopsticks paused. She distinctly remembered waking for last night's feeding...

Her phone vibrated. A message from Mr. Alistair appeared: 【This wonton soup tastes like Martha's. Try it】

The first sip brought familiar warmth to her eyes—an exact replica of memory's flavor.

【Delicious】 she replied.

The screen lit up again: 【Stella, I can do far more for you than this】

Like a pebble disturbing still waters, the words sent ripples through her heart. She suddenly realized—in unseen ways, Mr. Alistair had already woven a tender safety net around her.
###Chapter 107: The Fake Girlfriend

Stella Valentine believed those words without question.

Mr. Alistair never broke his promises.

If he said he would do something, he would.

Martha Clementson's arrival lifted a weight from her shoulders.

The experienced nanny took perfect care of baby Luna, and even Ethan clung to her.

Since Mr. Alistair had arranged this, Stella trusted her completely.

Her first priority after leaving the hospital was reporting to work.

She refused to accept special treatment because of Joy Fairsprene's connections. The office was already buzzing with gossip.

"Martha," Stella adjusted her bag, "I'm heading to the office. The children are in your hands."

Martha cradled Luna and nodded. "Don't worry, Miss Stella. But Mr. Alistair asked me to relay a message."

"He left a message?"

"A text received around three or four this morning." Martha lowered her voice. "He said he can't stop you from working, but remember—work exists to serve life. Now that Luna is back, don't push yourself too hard."

Three or four in the morning...

He really hadn't slept.

Stella pressed her lips together. "I understand."

She stopped by Houston Grand Hotel first to retrieve her things.

Room 1231 remained untouched, as if she could still catch his scent lingering in the air.

The black-framed glasses rested quietly on the nightstand.

She changed into an unflattering plaid shirt, double-checked her deliberately plain appearance in the mirror, then headed to Unique Jewelry.

The moment she stepped through the doors, Quentin Roland grabbed her arm.

"Stella! Thank God you're here!"

Chaos engulfed the office. Employees scurried in every direction.

"What's going on?"

Quentin dragged her toward the third floor. "Mrs. Valois is here!"

Inside the VIP lounge, an elegant woman sipped tea with regal poise.

Her burgundy velvet dress accentuated her grace, and the jade necklace around her throat screamed luxury.

"Five hundred custom jewelry sets?" Stella's eyes widened.

Quentin wiped his brow. "Mrs. Valois is trying to book five years' worth of orders so Mr. Valence can't use work as an excuse to avoid arranged marriages."

Stella frowned. "Forced matches never end well."

"Since when do elite families care?" Quentin whispered. "Just like the Roland and Valentine alliance back then—"

Stella's fingers twitched.

"—all glamour on the surface. Who knows what really happens behind closed doors?"

Her lashes lowered. "True."

Quentin's eyes suddenly lit up. "Perfect timing! The company desperately needs—"

The lounge door swung open.

Victor Valence stormed in, his gaze locking onto Stella. "You."

Quentin rushed to pledge loyalty. "Mr. Valence, whatever you need, I'll—"

"Not you." Victor cut him off, staring straight at Stella. "Only her."

Before she could react, he yanked her into the lounge.

The door slammed shut behind them.

"Mom," Victor slung an arm around Stella's shoulders, "this is my girlfriend."

The air froze.

Mrs. Valois's teacup clattered against its saucer.

Her razor-sharp eyes raked Stella from head to toe, her frown deepening. "This?"

"Yes. Her."

"Have you lost your mind?" Mrs. Valois stood abruptly. "Every debutante I've introduced is from an impeccable family. And you choose some..." She swallowed the word on her tongue, "...unadorned girl?"

Stella caught the implication.

At least the woman had enough class not to say "frumpy" outright.

Victor shrugged. "I like simplicity. What good are looks? Haven't we learned enough from my brother's mistakes?"

"Don't mention your brother!" Mrs. Valois trembled with anger. "With only you two carrying on the Valois name, and Julian still unmarried over that Joy Fairsprene—"

"Which is why I chose her." Victor tightened his grip. "You're the one being difficult."

Mrs. Valois scoffed. "Fine. Tell me—what's her name? What's her background? How did you meet?"

Victor faltered. Leaning close to Stella's ear, he whispered, "Actually...what was your name again?"
###Chapter 108: You're Not Mr. Alistair, Are You?

"You don't even know her name?"

Victor Valence shrugged. "Mom, I can't remember the names of all those blind dates you set me up with."

Eleanor Valois's face paled. She clutched her chest and collapsed onto the sofa.

"Mom!" Victor panicked.

Stella Valentine rushed forward. "It might be a hypertensive crisis. Open the windows!"

Victor fumbled to unlatch every window.

With practiced efficiency, Stella rummaged through Eleanor's purse and retrieved the antihypertensive medication. "Forgive me, Mrs. Valois."

She shook out a single pill and moved to administer it.

"Stop!" Victor grabbed her wrist. "You don't know the proper dosage!"

Stella gasped as pain shot through her wound. She curled into the corner, forehead beading with sweat.

"Mom, how do you feel?"

"I'll...die from your stupidity one day!"

Eleanor regained her breath but fixed her gaze on Stella. "You hurt the poor girl."

"I barely touched her—"

"Are those muscles just for show?" Eleanor snapped. "Go check on her!"

Victor hesitated. "Let me take you to the hospital first."

"No need. Your brother's almost here."

"Julian?"

"Since you actually listen to him."

The door swung open. Julian Valois strode in. "Mother."

"Help that young lady."

Julian knelt beside Stella, voice gentle. "Allow me to apologize for my brother. Do you need medical attention?"

Stella's lashes fluttered.

That voice...it was wrong.

During their last meeting, Julian's tone had been raspy and deep—identical to Mr. Alistair's. But now...

She lifted her head slowly.

Julian's pupils contracted. "Stella? What are you doing here?"

"I work at your brother's company." She forced a smile. "You knew that."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I...forgot in the moment. Where does it hurt?"

"My wound reopened."

"I'll take you to the hospital."

He reached to assist her, maintaining careful distance.

"Brother, you know her?" Victor narrowed his eyes.

Julian paused. "Miss Valentine is a friend."

"What kind of friend?" Victor's tone turned suggestive.

Eleanor slammed the coffee table. "Whose girlfriend is she really?"

Victor spread his hands. "Mom, she's not my girlfriend. Just a designer at the company—"

"You dragged some random woman here to fool me?"

"If you weren't forcing me to marry—" Victor froze. "Wait...is she actually your girlfriend? I thought you were with Joy Fairsprene—"

Stella felt Julian's hand tremble.

"Mr. Valois?"

"Let's go."

Stella shook her head. "No hospital."

Julian insisted, "I must answer to...someone."

"Who?"

He evaded. "Your late father wouldn't want you injured."

Stella jerked her hand back. "Mr. Valois, you're not Mr. Alistair, are you?"

The air turned glacial.

Julian gave a rueful smile. "You figured it out."

"Your voice and scent are different." Her voice shook. "Did he ask you to do this?"

"He has reasons." Julian sighed. "Perhaps it's better this way. No more acting."

"Do you still love Joy?"

Julian stiffened. "...Yes."

"Those jewelry designs were for her?"

"Yes."

Stella straightened her spine. "I'll create pieces Joy will adore."

Guilt flashed across Julian's face. "Stella, Mr. Alistair sacrificed much for you. Call me if you need anything."

"Thank you."

Eleanor looked utterly lost. "So this girl is—"

Stella inhaled deeply, summoning a professional smile. "Mrs. Valois, I'm Stella Valentine, lead designer at Unique Jewelry. Regarding those 500 pieces, what specifications do you require?"
###Chapter 109: Uniquely Unattractive

Eleanor Valois had ulterior motives for this visit.

She used jewelry customization as an excuse to pressure her sons into marriage.

Stella Valentine's quick thinking had just saved her from embarrassment.

"Five hundred sets won't be necessary," Eleanor adjusted her hair gracefully. "One custom piece will suffice. My sons are both hopeless—the eldest has been pining after some girl for seven years, and the younger one refuses to even date..."

Victor Valence interrupted, "Mom, Julian can handle continuing the Valois lineage. Women are too much trouble. I'm not getting married."

Eleanor sighed. "You're grown men now. I can't control you anymore. But..." She turned to Stella. "This designer just saved me. We should show our gratitude."

"I'll give her a raise," Victor offered promptly.

Still pale, Eleanor leaned on Julian for support. "Let me take you home, Mother."

Before leaving, Julian cast a lingering glance at Stella, his lips parting as if to speak.

Once they were gone, Victor sauntered over to Stella, scrutinizing her. "See? Even my scatterbrained brother wouldn't fall for someone like you. At least his taste is normal—what a relief."

Stella ignored him. Though brilliant in design, her boss remained an entitled playboy at heart.

She just wanted to focus on work and return home to her children.

More importantly—Julian wasn't Mr. Alistair.

This realization lifted a weight off her shoulders. She no longer needed to feel guilty around Joy Fairsprene. Perhaps she could even help clear their misunderstanding.

"Hey, Glasses Girl." Victor rapped impatiently on the desk.

Stella frowned. "What did you call me?"

"Glasses Girl." He pointed mockingly at her frames. "Who wears these outdated things anymore? Change them before meeting our client this afternoon. And get someone to do your makeup if you can't manage it yourself."

Stella suppressed a sigh. No wonder Joy called him venomous-tongued.

"We have a client meeting?"

Victor smirked. "A difficult one. All our other designers are dodging it. Care to try?"

"But I've already taken Julian and Eleanor's orders—"

"Those can wait." He waved dismissively. "Focus on this first." His gaze swept over her outfit with distaste. "Buy decent clothes and fix your appearance at lunch. Looking like this, people might mistake our company for a tutoring center."

Stella nodded. "Should I change back after the meeting?"

Considering his aversion to attractive women.

Victor snorted. "Do whatever you want. As long as you perform, you can stay as ugly as you like."

As she exited the VIP room, she caught his mutter: "...uniquely unattractive..."

Quentin Roland waited outside, offering awkward consolation. "Don't take Victor's attitude personally."

Stella smiled. "Artists are like that."

"Your afternoon client is Katrina Orlando, an international fashion designer," Quentin explained. "She wants ten jewelry sets to complement her new collection."

"Ten sets?"

"Better than Eleanor's five hundred." He chuckled. "The commission's substantial. Didn't you say you needed money?"

She did. Though Mr. Alistair covered all expenses, she insisted on repaying the three-million-dollar ring herself.

At lunch, she met Joy for shopping.

"My God!" Joy barely recognized her. "Stella, just because Victor hates beautiful women doesn't mean you have to sabotage yourself!"

Stella checked the rearview mirror. "Is it that bad?"

"You look like my cleaning lady," Joy whispered.

Stella gave a wry smile. "Victor has... unique preferences."

"He's a freak!" Joy rolled her eyes. "No one can handle him except Julian."

Mentioning Julian, Stella said softly, "I saw him today."

"At the office? He went to check on you, didn't he?" Joy shrugged. "Probably worried about your health."

"He admitted it."

"Admitted what?"

"That he's not Mr. Alistair."

Joy slammed the brakes. "He told you himself?"
###Chapter 110: Blissful Ignorance

Stella Valentine's eyes widened. "Impossible!"

She absently twisted the ring on her finger. "I've noticed for a while. Julian Valois has these subtle pauses when he speaks—Mr. Alistair never does. And Mr. Alistair wears sandalwood cologne, while Julian always smells of mint."

Joy Fairsprene tugged at her hair. "Then who could it be?"

"It doesn't matter anymore." Stella leaned back as sunlight dappled her lashes through the car window. "He has his reasons."

"You're just going to stay with someone whose identity you don't even know?"

Watching the blurring landscape outside, Stella murmured, "Not knowing is better. No expectations mean no disappointments. I used up all my courage on Adrian Roland. I can't survive another heartbreak."

Joy blinked in confusion. "Stella, I don't understand."

A soft chuckle escaped Stella's lips. "Good."

Joy suddenly slapped the steering wheel. "Oh! Chanel's new floral sundress would look perfect on you!"

Stella's fingers twitched.

Floral prints.

Adrian's favorite style for her.

"We're here!" Joy practically dragged her into the boutique, pointing at a lavender sundress on the mannequin. "That one!"

The dress resembled a cloud plucked from a lavender field.

After six years in trousers, the fabric felt foreign yet familiar against Stella's skin.

"Stella?" Joy knocked on the fitting room door.

Her cheeks burned. "Get me an L."

The door opened. Joy gasped. "Oh my—" Her gaze locked onto Stella's chest. "That's...too..."

The M-size dress strained across her bust, the lace trim accentuating every curve.

A commotion erupted from the next fitting room.

"Must you be so difficult?" A woman's petulant voice carried through. "You promised to tell me the truth if I went shopping with you."

A man's voice, thick with irritation: "Lily Savigny, enough."

"What, did you have patience when stargazing with Stella Valentine?" The woman's tone turned shrill. "Only I know the truth about your parents' accident!"

Stella froze.

BANG!

Joy kicked the partition hard. Lily's shriek pierced the air.

"Keep it down in public!" Joy swiftly wedged a sofa against the neighboring door and yelled, "Everyone! The New Frontier Group CEO's cheating in a fitting room!"

She dialed her phone. "City Hotline? There's breaking news at Chanel—"

Lily pounded on the door. "Joy Fairsprene, have you lost your mind?"

Perched on the sofa like a smug cat, Joy crossed her legs. "Reporters will be here soon. Take your time."
###Chapter 111 The Price of Truth

The fitting room door rattled violently under pounding fists.

Lily Savigny's voice slithered through the crack. "Joy Fairsprene! Have you lost your mind? Open this door!"

Leaning casually against the wall, Joy aimed her phone camera at the fitting room, lips curling into a icy smile. "Oh? In such a hurry now? Weren't you enjoying yourself earlier?"

"Stop spouting nonsense!" Lily's voice cracked with panic. "We were just trying on clothes!"

"Trying on clothes?" Joy's mocking laughter echoed. "Together? Should I call the press for an exclusive interview?"

Silence swallowed the fitting room.

Adrian Roland stood motionless against the wall, his glacial gaze pinning Lily in place. "Talk."

Her lips trembled as fingernails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"Adrian, let me explain—"

"Explain what?" His voice could freeze hell. "How you used my parents' death to manipulate me?"

Outside, Joy regaled the gathering crowd with theatrical gestures. "Everyone! Come see the scandal! CEO Roland and his mistress getting cozy in a fitting room—"

Stella Valentine grasped her friend's arm. "Joy. Enough."

"It's not enough!" Joy shook her off. "Have you forgotten what she did to you, Stella?"

Stella's gaze drifted toward the fitting room, shadows flickering in her eyes. "I don't want the children witnessing this."

Inside the cramped space, Lily suddenly laughed.

"You really want the truth, Adrian?"

His eyes turned blade-sharp. "Speak."

"Fine." She inhaled sharply. "That car crash wasn't an accident."

"Continue."

"Someone tampered with the vehicle." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "The brake system..."

Adrian's hand shot out, vise-like around her wrist. "Who?"

"Let go! You're hurting me!"

"Names."

"It was..." Her pupils dilated with venom. "Shi Feng."

Adrian's grip slackened.

"Impossible."

"Open your eyes!" Lily massaged her reddened wrist. "He'd been plotting to take over the Roland empire for years."

"Stella wouldn't lie to me."

A humorless chuckle escaped Lily's lips. "Still defending her? Then tell me—how did her father really die?"

Commotion erupted outside.

"Press is here!" Joy's triumphant announcement sliced through the noise.

Lily's face drained of color.

Adrian remained eerily calm. "Finish."

"Shi Feng..." Her voice quivered. "He meant to kill your parents, but the plan backfired when—"

"Evidence."

Her eyelashes fluttered. "I saw it myself..."

Adrian's sudden laughter held no mirth.

"Do I look like a fool to you, Lily?"

"It's the truth!"

"Then why did the police find nothing?" He advanced, forcing her against the wall. "Why are you the only witness?"

Her back pressed into cold mirrors.

"Because... because..."

"Because it was you."

The accusation hit like a sledgehammer. Lily's entire body convulsed.

"Lies!"

"Only you had access to that car."

Her scream tore through the air. "Why would I kill them?"

"To drive Stella and me apart." His quiet tone carried lethal precision. "To break me. To create an opening for yourself."

Lily's complexion turned ashen.

Camera flashes strobed beyond the door.

"Mr. Roland! What's your relationship with this woman?"

"Sources say you were intimate in the fitting room—"

Joy jutted her chin. "This is what happens to homewreckers!"

Stella melted into the crowd's periphery.

Her phone vibrated.

An unknown number flashed onscreen:

"Want the truth about your father's death?"
###Chapter 112: Commitment to the Role

"Move aside!"

The fitting room door burst open with a crash.

Camera flashes erupted instantly as reporters swarmed in with their equipment. Lily Savigny shrieked and scrambled behind Adrian Roland, only to be captured perfectly by the sharp-eyed paparazzi.

"Mr. Roland! It really is you!"

"Is this lady your new flame?"

"Rumors say you're engaged to Miss Valentine, yet you're having a secret rendezvous in a fitting room. Does she know about this?"

Joy Fairsprene hid behind the crowd, laughing gleefully. "Serves them right! Let these two cheaters taste public humiliation. How does it feel, Stella?"

Stella Valentine watched the besieged pair and nodded faintly. "Quite satisfying."

"You should've retaliated like this sooner! Why should you struggle alone with the kids while they live it up?"

Stella checked her watch. "Joy, I need to head back to the office. I have a client meeting this afternoon."

"Fine, mission accomplished today." Joy tugged her through the crowd. "Wait till you see tomorrow's headlines!"

Once in the car, Stella suddenly remembered. "We forgot to pay for the dress!"

"Oh no, I completely blanked!"

"Should we go back?"

"But you'll be late for work..."

Ding—

Her phone chimed right on cue.

[Dress has been paid for.]

"Mr. Alistair?" Joy raised an eyebrow. "Let me guess—he said the dress is taken care of?"

Stella nodded.

"Your Mr. Alistair," Joy sighed, "is like a genie, granting wishes on demand. I’m so jealous."

"You could have one too."

"Stop right there!" Joy waved a hand. "I’m not signing up for forced matrimony."

Stella hesitated.

"Sorry," Joy smacked the steering wheel in frustration. "I really need to filter my mouth..."

A sudden honk made her slam the gas pedal, jerking the car forward.

"Scared me half to death..." Joy clutched her chest. "I’m visiting Harry Vance’s magazine shoot later."

"Aren’t you two just pretending?"

"Commitment to the role, darling."

As the car stopped at the office entrance, Joy winked. "Want me to pick you up tonight?"

"No need," Stella stepped out. "Focus on your plans."

"Maybe Mr. Alistair will come for you?"

Ding—

[The dress suits you perfectly.]

Stella’s lips curved. [Thank you.]

[To celebrate my little star’s victory today, what would you like for dinner?]

[Those models have such perfect figures. I can’t compare.]

[They couldn’t fill out a size L dress.]

Stella instinctively glanced down.

The skirt’s loose hem contrasted sharply with the snug fit across her chest.

[Mr. Alistair, you saw me?]

[Stunning.]

[Were you at the boutique?]

[Yes.]

"Miss, we’re closed to walk-ins today." A familiar voice interrupted her.

"Manager Quentin?"

"You know me?" Quentin Roland looked apologetic. "I didn’t mean to stop you—"

"I’m—"

"The model, right?" His face lit up with realization. "Katrina’s waiting! Hurry inside!"

Without another word, he ushered her into the VIP lounge.

"You’re late," a pixie-cut woman turned—then froze. "Miss Valentine?"

"Miranda?" Stella recognized the stylist.

"What a coincidence!" Miranda lowered her voice. "Have you... met Mr. Alistair yet?"
###Chapter 113: The Simpler the Condition, the Harder to Fulfill

"...Not yet."

Miranda wasn't surprised by this answer. She simply nodded. "He must still be handling that matter. Until then, I doubt he'll seek you out. But Miss Valentine, please give him time. He's mentioned your story to me. To my eyes, you two are a match made in heaven."

Stella's eyes widened slightly. "He told you about us?"

"...Just a few words, nothing detailed." Miranda brushed it off and changed the subject. "By the way, I'm here today with Katrina to customize jewelry. She has exacting standards and a sharp temper. Brace yourself."

Stella nodded calmly. "Unique Jewelry always prioritizes client needs. Whatever she requests, I'll design accordingly."

"And your boss..." Miranda lowered her voice. "Victor Valence's tongue is even sharper than Katrina's. When those two clash, it'll be like flint against steel. Try not to get caught in the crossfire."

Stella shrugged, signaling she was prepared.

"...Miranda, where's the model?" A tall blonde woman strode in, her gaze sweeping over Stella with disdain. "How tall are you?"

This must be the infamous Katrina Orlando.

Before Stella could explain she wasn't the model, Miranda smoothly recited: "Height 165 cm, weight 45 kg, measurements 95-60-80, leg-to-body ratio 0.62."

"Too short!" Katrina frowned. "But the proportions are decent. Since there's no one else, you'll do. Go change quickly."

Stella stared at Miranda in disbelief.

Miranda clasped her hands pleadingly, mouthing "Please."

Stella sighed. Clearly, Miranda's model had bailed last minute, and she was the stand-in. Considering Miranda's past help, she couldn't refuse.

Following Katrina into the dressing room, Stella was handed a dress. "Wear this. Apply light makeup and hurry up!"

Ten minutes later, Stella entered the conference room with the other models.

Katrina, Miranda, and Victor were already there, while Manager Quentin rushed to pour Katrina coffee.

"These are my ten autumn collection outfits. Each requires complementary jewelry." Katrina crossed her arms. "Money isn't an issue, but the pieces must capture the soul of the garments."

The demand was absurd.

They were jewelers, not fashion designers. How could they decipher the "soul" of clothing?

And Katrina was notoriously difficult. This wouldn't be easy money.

Victor smirked coldly. "Any other requirements?"

"No, it's that simple."

"The simpler the condition, the harder to fulfill."

Katrina lifted her chin arrogantly. "That's why I chose Unique Jewelry. Madeline Valdemar highly recommended a designer here named Valentine. Where is she?"

Victor frowned. "Quentin, find out why Miss Valentine isn't here."

"Right away."

"No need." A clear voice came from the lineup. "Mr. Valence, I arrived long ago."

Victor turned, his pupils contracting sharply.

Quentin gaped. "M-Miss Valentine?"

Stella nodded. "The model was missing, so I filled in."

True to her reputation, Katrina had chosen the most conservative outfit for Stella. A camel-colored cashmere skirt accentuated her curves, paired with a British-style shirt and sweater vest. Her high ponytail made her look youthful and vibrant—a stark contrast to her usual plain appearance with black-framed glasses.

"...Where are your glasses?" Victor finally found his voice.

Stella pointed to the dressing room. "Took them off to change."

"Can you see without them?"

"Mr. Valence, I'm not nearsighted."

Victor was taken aback. "Then why wear glasses?"

"You said you disliked beautiful women. To get hired, I had to adapt."

Victor fell silent.

Quentin stifled a laugh until Victor shot him a glare. "Miss Orlando, this is the designer you mentioned."

Katrina scrutinized Stella like an X-ray. "A designer?"

"Yes."

"Pity. With this figure, she could've been a top model if she were taller."

Another intense gaze burned into her. Stella turned to meet Victor's eyes, but the usually arrogant man looked away guiltily, coughing to cover his embarrassment.

"Ahem." Victor tapped the table with his pen. "Katrina, discuss your needs directly with Miss Valentine."

Katrina noticed his discomfort and teased, "Mr. Valence, are you blushing? How rare."

"Who's blushing? It's hot in here!"

"But the thermostat says 20 degrees..."

Victor snapped, "This is a professional meeting!"

"Fine, fine, I'll stop." Katrina covered her mouth, amused. "Today's been worthwhile—custom jewelry and seeing Mr. Valence flustered..."

Victor stood and left.

Quentin hurried to apologize. "Miss Orlando, Mr. Valence must have urgent business..."

Katrina waved it off. "I understand. At twenty-nine and never been in love, it's about time he bloomed!"

"What about your requirements..."

"Don't worry. Miss Valentine and I will have a thorough discussion."

Once alone, Katrina said with interest, "Miss Valentine, to secure this job, I'll test you first."

"How?"

"Design jewelry for the outfit you're wearing. Include a hair accessory. I'll review it tomorrow. Any issues?"

A full set usually took three to seven days. This was clearly a challenge.

Yet Stella replied calmly, "If you're free this afternoon, I can present a draft in two hours."
###Chapter 114: Only Men Understand Men

Katrina arched an eyebrow. "Two hours?"

"Actually, one hour would suffice, though the measurements might not be as precise."

"Are you sure?"

Stella smiled faintly. "Why not wait and see for yourself? Efficiency matters—no need to drag things out."

Katrina nodded with interest. "Intriguing. If I'm satisfied in an hour, you'll handle all jewelry designs for my future collections."

Stella's eyes lit up. Katrina launched four seasonal lines annually, plus custom orders—easily over a hundred designs a year. The lucrative deal could pay off Mr. Alistair's ring and reclaim her family's shares within twelve months.

She grabbed her sketchboard and retreated to the adjacent design studio, her pencil flying across the paper.

The door clicked open.

Victor Valence leaned against the frame, eyeing her draft. "Schoolgirl theme?"

"Not exactly." Her pencil never paused. "Katrina's collection incorporates uniform elements, but the body-hugging skirt targets young professionals. It balances youthful charm with feminine allure. Real school uniforms forbid accessories."

Victor frowned. "Domestic schools are that strict?"

"We had weekly grooming inspections. Even dyed hair had to be reverted immediately."

"How oppressive."

"Focusing on academics isn't a bad thing." Her pencil halted. "Did you need something, Mr. Valence?"

He suddenly closed the distance. "What's your real relationship with my brother?"

Stella stiffened. "It's complicated, but Julian and I are completely platonic."

"Starting tomorrow, lose those hideous glasses."

"I thought you disliked beautiful women."

"I dislike those who weaponize their beauty." His gaze burned. "As for you—"

Her phone vibrated.

[Stella, I get jealous too.]

Her lips curled involuntarily.

[Don't misunderstand, Mr. Valence is just my boss.]

[Only men understand men. His gaze toward you... is off.]

She bolted into the hallway—empty.

[Stop looking. We'll meet when the time comes.]

Back at her desk, another message arrived: [Dinner at Oceanview tonight? Your favorite.]

[But the lighting there...]

[Just say yes or no.]

[Yes.]

Her pulse raced. How would Mr. Alistair conceal his identity under bright lights?

[I'll pick you up after work. No interruptions—just us.]

"Who has you so engrossed?" Victor snatched her charcoal pencil.

Stella hastily pocketed her phone. "Apologies, I'll resume work."

"Answer me." He stepped closer. "Boyfriend?"

"No."

"Good—"

"It's my husband."

Victor's expression darkened. "You're married?!"

"Finalizing the divorce."

"And still entangled?"

"Not with him."

A vein throbbed at Victor's temple. "How many men are in your life?"

"Outside my job description, isn't it?" She reclaimed her pencil. "I'll focus on creating value for the company."

He slammed the door. "Quentin's idiotic suggestion!"

Stella shook her head. The heir's temper was baffling.

Forty minutes later, as she neared completion, her phone rang.

Adrian's voice was icy. "I'm visiting the kids tonight."

"I have plans."

"Denying parental rights?"

"Reschedule."

"With that 'Mr. Alistair'?" His tone dropped. "Have you slept with him?"

Her grip tightened. "He's a gentleman!"

"Bring him to meet me."

"Unnecessary!"

"Oh, it's necessary." Adrian sneered. "I'll win you back—fair competition."

"You're insane."

"What? Is he too cowardly to face me?"
###Chapter 115: The Secret Invitation

Stella Valentine ended the call decisively.

She had no time for irrelevant people.

Adrian Roland's calls kept flashing on her screen. She muted them without hesitation. Let him call as much as he wanted—she wouldn’t answer.

Time ticked by.

Stella walked into the VIP lounge right on schedule, her design portfolio in hand.

Katrina Orlando was chatting with Manager Quentin when she entered. The designer's red lips curved. "58 minutes and 30 seconds. Just barely on time."

"I never break my promises."

Stella spread her sketches across the table.

"This jewelry set is designed for young professionals. I've combined tassel ear cuffs with delicate chain accents and pavé diamonds. It maintains elegance without appearing too mature. Considering budget constraints for women just starting their careers, this design is both beautiful and affordable."

Manager Quentin paled. He rushed forward and grabbed her arm. "Have you lost your mind? Katrina Orlando's brand is luxury couture! Affordable? Redo this immediately!"

"But the outfit's style—"

"Forget the outfit!" Quentin hissed. "Katrina only has one requirement—the more expensive, the better!"

Stella was speechless.

A renowned designer with such demands?

"Stop standing there. I'll stall her. Go fix this—"

Quentin pushed her toward the door, only to collide with Victor Valence as he entered.

Stella stumbled forward, caught by Victor's steadying grip.

"Throwing yourself at me?" He released her with a cold smirk.

She quickly regained her balance. "My apologies, Mr. Valence—"

Victor ignored her, striding toward Katrina. His gaze flicked to the designs. "Your work?"

Stella nodded.

To her surprise, his demeanor shifted. He slid the sketches toward Katrina. "Thoughts?"

Katrina crossed her arms, amused. "Brilliant."

"What?" Quentin gaped. "You... approve?"

Katrina studied the drawings closely. "Unique Jewelry lives up to its name. Ms. Valentine's vision perfectly aligns with my collection's theme. I'd like to invite her as the exclusive jewelry designer for all my new pieces."

Stella's heart raced. "No revisions needed?"

"None." Katrina's smile deepened. "No one understands my aesthetic better than you."

Before signing the contract, Katrina leaned close. "You're fortunate."

Stella frowned.

Fortunate? With her family gone, her health failing, her marriage hollow...

Unless...

"Ms. Orlando!" Stella caught up to her. "Did you choose me because of... Mr. Alistair?"

Katrina's lips twitched. "Mr. Alistair? An interesting title. But no. I never lie—your talent impressed me."

She paused. "I believe in fate, Ms. Valentine. You and your 'Mr. Alistair' will reunite."

The word echoed in Stella's mind all afternoon.

Reunite? An odd choice. Poor English, or something more?

Suddenly, warm hands covered her eyes.

The familiar scent of cologne surrounded her.

"Mr. Alistair?"

"Work hours are over. Why are you still here?" His voice brushed her ear.

She realized the office was empty.

"Please wait outside. I'll just—"

"Not a second longer." His lips grazed her neck.

She shivered. "We're at the company—"

The hands withdrew, replaced by a silk scarf.

"Too tight?"

"It's fine."

"Tell me if it's uncomfortable."

He guided her toward the exit.

Stella hesitated. "The front door isn’t safe. Let’s use the back—"

Mr. Alistair chuckled. "The back door?"

Her cheeks burned. "That’s not what I meant—"

"My Stella," he teased, "how knowledgeable you are."
###Chapter 116: The Word I Fear Most is "What If"

The black silk ribbon plunged Stella Valentine's world into darkness as it covered her eyes.

Her fingers instinctively tightened around Mr. Alistair's sleeve.

"Afraid?" His deep voice murmured near her ear.

"Not afraid..." She bit her lip. "Just...unaccustomed to sudden darkness."

A soft chuckle vibrated through his chest. His warm palm covered her trembling hand. "I'm here."

Those three words worked like magic, easing the tension in her shoulders.

"Mr. Alistair."

"Hmm?"

"That phrase you used earlier..."

"Which one?"

"The...backdoor thing..." Her voice dwindled to a whisper.

He halted abruptly. She stumbled forward, colliding with his solid chest.

"Where exactly did your mind wander?" Amusement laced his tone.

Heat flooded her cheeks. "I merely—"

"Merely what?" His breath teased her burning earlobe as he leaned closer.

"You men..." She turned her face away in flustered indignation. "Always overcomplicating things."

His chest shook with silent laughter as he pulled her closer. "My world is simple. Just you and the children."

"..."

"Your ears are red."

"They are not!"

"I can see them."

Stella stomped her foot in protest. "Unfair. You can see me, but I can't see you."

A weighted pause. Then a sigh. "Stella..."

"I know." She cut him off gently. "I'm not asking to see your face now. I just want...to know you better."

His body stiffened against hers.

"Like..." She gathered courage. "Your favorite food. Favorite color. Whether you prefer sunny or rainy days—mmph!"

His lips silenced hers in a kiss so tender and lingering, her knees nearly buckled afterward.

"Stella." His voice had gone rough.

"Yes?" She swayed dizzily.

"My world was barren." His whisper feathered across her damp lips. "Until you."

Her heart stuttered.

"Food was mere sustenance. Weather never affected my mood." His fingers traced the hem of her dress. "But now...I have a favorite color."

"...Which is?"

"Lilac." Like the Chanel dress Joy had chosen for her.

"Wear it more often."

"Okay."

A satisfied kiss landed on her forehead before he guided her forward. He navigated Unique Jewelry's layout flawlessly, avoiding all staff until they reached the exit.

"Hold tight."

Suddenly, she was swept into his arms.

"Mr. Alistair!"

"Don't struggle." His arms tightened. "Walking blindfolded is dangerous."

"But—"

"Stella." His tone turned grave. "There's one word I dread—'what if.'"

Understanding dawned. This was why he treated every precaution with such gravity.

She stopped resisting, looping her arms around his neck and resting her cheek against his heartbeat.

"Have I gained weight?"

He adjusted his grip. "A little."

"..."

"Good." His lips brushed her hairline. "Means you're eating properly."

A smile tugged her lips as she listened to his steady pulse.

"When you carried Ethan..." he asked suddenly, "were you this light?"

Her smile froze.

"In Switzerland..." Her whisper trembled. "I almost jumped into the river with him."

His arms became steel bands around her.

"Hugo saved us." She continued quietly. "Later, he cooked Chinese meals for me..."

"Hugo Merovingian." Ice edged his voice.

"He showed me kindness."

A pause. "That debt will be repaid."

Stella hesitated. She sensed his misunderstanding but lacked words to clarify.

"His intentions aren't pure."

"That's not—"

"Stella." He cut her off. "I won't let anyone take you from me."

The car glided from the garage.

"Oceanview Restaurant?"

She shook her head. "Not ideal during breastfeeding."

"My apologies. That was thoughtless."

"It's fine." She squeezed his hand. "Let's...go home instead? I'll cook for you."

"You?"

"Mm. I've never made you a proper meal."

Silence stretched.

"Alright." Finally, he relented. "But Martha handles the groceries."

"Truly no food preferences?"

"None mattered before." His thumb stroked her knuckles. "Now...I might develop favorites because of you."

Warmth bloomed in her chest.

"My father..." Her voice cracked. "Loved my cooking best."

His fingers interlaced with hers. "Want to investigate that accident?"

Her grip turned vise-like.

"Lily confessed." Her voice shook. "But without evidence..."

"Leave it to me." Steel underpinned his vow. "If you wish."

"I do!" The cry tore from her throat. "More than anything!"

Tears overflowed.

"I don't want Adrian's apologies..." Sobs wracked her frame. "Just justice..."

He pulled over and crushed her to his chest.

"Don't cry." His lips brushed her wet cheeks. "I'm here."

"I failed them all..." She wept into his shirt. "Dad, Mom, the children...I couldn't protect anyone..."

"Shh." His palm cradled her head. "You have me now."

His embrace felt like sanctuary, dissolving shadows with its warmth.

Gradually, her tears subsided.

In that moment, she understood—

No matter what storms awaited, this man would always shelter her beneath clear skies.
###Chapter 117: Stop Pretending

The scenery outside the car window blurred past in reverse.

Stella Valentine sat quietly in the passenger seat, a silk scarf covering her eyes. She could feel the vehicle weaving through the city streets.

The clamor of school dismissal drifted through the window.

"How did you only score sixty on this math test?" A mother's sharp reprimand cut through the noise.

A child's cheerful voice followed. "Mommy, my teacher praised my dancing today!"

As they passed through the commercial district, the aroma of street food seeped through the car's cracks.

Braised pork's savory richness, grilled fish's spicy tang, and stir-fried vegetables' crisp freshness blended into the bustling urban atmosphere.

"Mr. Alistair," Stella spoke suddenly.

"Hmm?"

"Have you always worn this cologne because you like it?"

His fingers tightened slightly around the steering wheel.

"Professional necessity," he answered curtly.

Stella nodded thoughtfully. She should have realized—Mr. Alistair's identity was undoubtedly complex.

"Don't like the scent? I can change it."

"No need." She shook her head. "This fragrance... is distinctive."

Distinctive enough for her to recognize him instantly in a crowd.

The phone's sudden ringtone shattered the moment.

Fumbling to answer, Stella stiffened at her mother's tearful voice.

"Mom? Why did you leave the hospital?"

Hanging up, she ripped off the scarf. "Mr. Alistair, I need to go home immediately."

His brow furrowed. "I'll take you."

"But your identity—"

"Just to the doorstep." He pressed the accelerator. "Contact me immediately if anything happens."

Stella clenched her fists. What were Victor Lefèvre and Sophia Durand planning to do to her mother?

The car halted before the Valentine family estate.

The sweet scent of osmanthus blossoms couldn't mask the tension radiating from the house.

Pushing open the door, Stella instantly spotted her mother's red-rimmed eyes.

"Stella..." Grace Laurent choked out, grasping her daughter's hand.

At the room's center, Lily Savigny sobbed against Sophia's shoulder while Victor puffed on a cigarette, face stormy.

Most striking was the white-haired elder—Edward Roland leaned on his cane, gaze piercing.

"This is Mr. Roland," Sophia introduced with false sweetness.

Stella bowed respectfully. "Mr. Roland."

"Enough!" The old man's cane struck the floor sharply. "Stop your pathetic acting!"

Sophia's face paled. "What do you mean?"

"You think this old fool doesn't know the truth about my son's accident?" Edward's laugh was icy. "A millennium-old fox trying to trick me with cheap theatrics!"

Victor shot to his feet. "Sir! We invited you today to discuss Lily's pregnancy!"

"Pregnant?" Edward scoffed. "Not my problem!"

"You—!" Victor's face purpled with rage. "Is the Roland family denying responsibility?"

Ignoring him, Edward studied Stella intently.

"So you're little Stella?" His expression softened unexpectedly. "That boy Adrian has decent taste after all."
###Chapter 118: He Knows Everything About You

Stella Valentine moistened her dry lips. "Grandfather Edward, Adrian and I... are getting a divorce."

"Who agreed to this?" Edward Roland slammed his hand on the table. "I refuse! That brat wants a divorce? He’ll have to step over my dead body first!"

Victor Lefèvre sneered. "Old man, didn’t you just say young people should have freedom in marriage? Now you’re stopping them? Isn’t that contradictory?"

Edward scoffed. "Since when does an outsider like you get to meddle in how I discipline my own grandson?"

"You—"

"What if I’m biased? What’s it to you, Lefèvre?"

Victor’s face darkened. He’d invited the old man here today to pressure Adrian into the divorce—how had the tables turned like this?

Suppressing his rage, he hissed, "Then what about your grandson getting my daughter pregnant? Don’t we deserve an explanation?"

"Fine." Edward crossed his legs leisurely and held out a hand to Lily Savigny. "Let’s see the paternity test."

Sophia Durand immediately shielded her daughter. "How dare you humiliate her like this? Lily is the victim here!"

"Victim?" Edward snorted. "I don’t believe a word of it."

Sophia gritted her teeth. "Then ask Adrian yourself!"

Before she finished speaking, Adrian appeared in the doorway.

His gaze swept the room, darkening when it landed on Stella. "You said you had plans tonight. This is where you came?"

Stella turned away. "I was going to meet you. But your precious Lily couldn’t stand seeing my mother and me at peace. Adrian, you promised to keep her in check."

Adrian frowned at Lily. "What did you do?"

"I should be asking you!" Lily burst into tears. "Adrian, I’m pregnant!"

He froze.

"That day you came back to the apartment... I thought you’d changed your mind..." Lily sobbed pitifully. "But you blocked my number. Even Vincent wouldn’t take my calls. The one time you took me shopping, we got photographed... Is it wrong for me to want answers?"

A vein throbbed at Adrian’s temple.

Edward slammed his cane on the floor. "You brat! What happened to your promise to only love Stella for the rest of your life?"

"Grandfather..." Stella called softly.

"Yes, I’m here."

"We... can’t go back."

"No!" Edward said firmly. "You’re the only granddaughter-in-law I recognize!"

Grace Laurent, who had been silent until now, spoke up. "Let them divorce." She wiped her tears. "Mr. Roland, thank you for protecting Stella. But since Adrian has someone else... we’ll step aside. My daughter..." Her voice broke. "What kind of life has she had these past six years?"

Stella hugged her mother tightly, her gaze sharp as a blade toward Lily and Sophia. "We haven’t even settled the matter of you targeting my daughter, and now you’re bullying my mother?"

Sophia shrieked, "Who targeted your daughter? Where’s your proof?"

"I don’t need proof." Stella’s smile was icy. "I know it was you."

She helped Grace up. "Mom, I’ll take you back to the hospital."

"No! I can’t leave you alone—"

"I’m not alone."

"Then who—?"

"Mr. Alistair."

Grace looked confused. "Who is that?"

"The man who pulled me out of hell."

Outside the house, Stella dialed a number.

"Miss Valentine, Mr. Alistair sent me to pick you up. I’ll be there in one minute." It was the familiar voice of his driver.

"Where is he?"

"He can’t appear in person, but he said he’ll handle the Lefèvre family."

A black Maybach glided silently to the curb. Grace leaned weakly against the seat as Stella burned with the urge to go back and tear those women apart.

"Mr. Alistair said not to dirty your hands."

Stella arched a brow. "He even knew I’d think that?"

The driver chuckled. "He told me you’d ask. His exact words were, I know everything about you."

Stella pulled out her phone and texted:
[Mr. Alistair, I want revenge. Now.]

[Done.]

The reply came instantly.

The car radio crackled to life: "...New developments in Adrian Roland’s fitting room scandal! The woman involved was photographed seven years ago leaving a hotel with William Rubenstein, CEO of Levi Realty. That same June, she was seen making out with Leonard Kalisto, head of Gefen Apparel..."

Joy Fairsprene’s call exploded through the speakers. "Stella! Turn on the news! Lily’s entire dirty history just got exposed!"

The broadcast continued, listing a string of powerful names. Stella remembered William—he was even older than Victor.

"She’s finished!" Joy crowed. "With so many big shots after her, she won’t last a day in Houston!"
###Chapter 119: She Is Her Own Queen

Stella Valentine's fingers trembled slightly as she gripped her phone.

Lily Savigny's sordid past had been exposed in such excruciating detail. To compile such comprehensive dossiers on so many influential figures, Mr. Alistair must have been preparing this for a long time.

He was only waiting for her command.

"Stella!" Joy Fairsprene's excited voice shook through the phone. "This is so satisfying! Who knew locking them in that fitting room would uncover such a huge scandal!"

Stella replied softly, "Joy, I owe you for that day."

"You're too kind—that's why people bully you!" Joy sounded exasperated. "Revenge is best served immediately!"

Stella chuckled. "Yes, ma'am."

"By the way," Joy suddenly lowered her voice, "who orchestrated this? Was it Mr. Alistair?"

"Yes."

Joy gasped. "He even dug up photos from over a decade ago... Stella, your Mr. Alistair is terrifying."

Stella's heart clenched.

She knew better than anyone that Lily had been led down this path by her scheming mother.

For money, they had abandoned all decency!

"Stella?" Joy abruptly changed the subject. "Where are you now?"

"Taking Mom to the hospital."

"I'm going to talk to Julian Valois." Joy spoke rapidly. "He must know who Mr. Alistair really is!"

Stella quickly stopped her. "Don't—"

"No!" Joy was adamant. "I need to know his intentions!"

After hanging up, Grace Laurent weakly opened her eyes. "Little star..."

"Mom, it was just my friend." Stella steadied her mother's frail body.

Grace's face was deathly pale. "Was it the Fairsprene child who lent you money?"

Stella froze.

"I understand everything." Grace trembled as she grasped her daughter's hand. "Adrian... how could he treat you like this?"

"Mom, I have a job." Stella straightened her back. "I'm a designer at Unique Jewelry. I can support you and the children."

Tears welled in Grace's eyes. "Really?"

"Next month, there's a fashion exhibition. I'll take you to see my work." Stella's gaze was resolute. "I'm not the Valentine family's little princess anymore. I am my own queen."

Grace burst into tears. "I just want you to be safe..."

"The Valentine legacy was Dad's life's work." Stella's voice turned icy. "I will take it back."

The car came to a smooth stop.

The driver said respectfully, "Miss Valentine, we've arrived at the hospital."

Grace thanked him weakly, and the driver quickly waved it off. "You should thank our Mr. Alistair."

"Mr. Alistair is...?" Grace looked at her daughter in confusion.

Stella swiftly helped her out of the car, cutting off further questions.

After settling her mother in, the doctor warned sternly, "She must avoid any more stress."

When Stella returned to the room, Grace was already fast asleep.

Downstairs, the Maybach still waited silently.

[Don't move.]

The familiar handkerchief once again covered her eyes.

"Mr. Alistair?!"

Warm arms encircled her. "I'm here to take you home."

The words made Stella's nose sting.

"Your mother will receive the best care." His whisper brushed her ear. "And Lily Savigny will pay for what she's done."

"Mr. Alistair..." Stella's voice trembled. "You knew about Lily all along?"
###Chapter 120: Sweet Memories

"...Not too early. I investigated her immediately after waking up. The findings were quite remarkable."

Stella Valentine caught the key detail: "Waking up?"

Silence lingered on the other end of the line.

"Yes. I woke up."

Mr. Alistair stopped the car outside her apartment, his voice gentle. "Stella, go rest upstairs. Martha should have dinner ready. I'll come by tonight."

Stella adjusted the silk blindfold over her eyes and nodded obediently. "Alright."

The scent of his cologne suddenly grew closer. Warm hands cradled her face, followed by a fleeting kiss on her lips. "Wait for me."

"...Mm."

His kiss was restrained, yet Stella could feel the storm of emotions beneath the surface.

After a long moment, he finally opened the car door for her, pulling her into one last embrace. "Sometimes I wish night would never end, so we wouldn't have to keep saying goodbye."

Stella returned the hug lightly. "You promised to tell me everything when this is over."

"Yes."

"So we won't be apart forever."

"...Mm."

"But Mr. Alistair...can we hurry? I'm afraid..."

Afraid the cancer would return.

More afraid she might leave this world before learning the truth.

His arms tightened around her. "I'll make it quick."

Stella stood motionless after exiting the car, only removing the blindfold once the engine faded into the distance.

True to his word, Martha had prepared dinner—four dishes and a steaming soup.

"Miss Stella, Mr. Alistair only told me to cook at the last minute, so it's a bit rushed..."

Stella smiled apologetically. "Thank you for your hard work."

"Not at all! He pays me ten times the market rate, and you and the children are so kind..."

"Where are the kids?"

"Ethan is such a good big brother. This afternoon he fed Luna and played with her. You don't see many boys his age being so attentive—must take after Mr. Alistair."

Stella forced a smile and headed to the nursery.

Ethan was crouched beside the crib, dangling a plush toy to amuse his baby sister. The tenderness in his eyes was heartbreaking.

The sight made Stella's nose sting.

Ethan's profile was the spitting image of Adrian Roland's.

Genetics were strange. Despite their identical looks, their personalities couldn't be more different.

"Mommy!"

Ethan threw himself into her arms. "I missed you."

"Did Hugo teach you to say that?"

Ethan shook his head. "I really did miss you."

Stella hugged him tightly. "I missed you too."

"Luna was extra good today." He tugged her toward the crib. "She looks more like you now."

Martha brought over a bottle. "Little Luna has quite the appetite. She'll be a foodie when she grows up."

Stella couldn't help but laugh.

She'd been a glutton as a child too.

Because of her low blood sugar, her father had special star-shaped glucose candies made for her.

But she hated carrying them, so Adrian always kept them in his pocket.

He'd appear like clockwork between classes, leaning against the classroom door, his white dress shirt billowing slightly in the breeze, spinning the candies between his fingers.

Once, when the teacher ran overtime, she kept glancing anxiously out the window.

The class monitor teased, "Hurry up, Professor Winston! Someone's waiting to see her Adrian!"

Amid the class's laughter, Adrian strode right in, crouched beside her desk, and dropped the candies. "What, don't recognize me?"

Flustered, she shoved him. "Get out!"

He ruffled her hair. "I'll deal with you when we get home."

Before leaving, he even told the teacher, "Go on, Professor Winston!"

The teacher scolded jokingly, "How can I continue with you hovering like that?"

The monitor egged them on. "Plenty of guys have crushes on Stella!"

The teacher feigned sternness. "She's already been accepted to Harvard. Any of you dare to date early, just try me!"

Groans filled the classroom.

"Mommy?" Ethan tugged her hand. "Are you thinking about Daddy? You're smiling."

Stella startled, realizing her lips had curled upward.

"Yes. Just some old memories."

Ethan propped his chin in his hands. "Martha says babies turn out pretty when their parents love each other. Since Luna and I are so cute, Daddy must've loved you a lot when we were born, right?"
###Chapter 121: Adrian Doesn't Deserve You

Stella Valentine's fingers trembled slightly.

She remembered the night Ethan was born, writhing in agony alone at a foreign hospital. Meanwhile, Adrian Roland was back home, consumed by vengeance.

Luna's birth had been an even greater nightmare.

"Mommy," Ethan suddenly grasped her hand, "Daddy must love you very much. Since Luna is prettier than me, he must love you even more now."

Stella chuckled. "What do you know about love?"

"Of course I do!" Ethan excitedly mentioned his friend from Switzerland. "John said he's going to marry Linda!"

Stella massaged her temples.

Five-year-olds discussing marriage—that was way too advanced.

"Mommy, is new Daddy coming home tonight?"

"He will, but very late."

"Can I see him?"

Stella hesitated. "Not yet."

Ethan's eyes lit up. "I know! Daddy must be a superhero, saving the world like Spider-Man!"

Stella couldn't help but laugh.

Mr. Alistair had indeed saved her world.

Martha Clementson called from outside the door. "Miss Stella, dinner's getting cold."

At the dining table, Ethan devoured his nutritious meal.

While clearing the dishes, Martha whispered mysteriously, "Miss Stella, let me read your palm."

"You know how?"

"Everyone in my village said I was accurate." Martha lowered her voice. "But revealing too much isn't good. I only read for special people now."

Hesitantly, Stella extended her hand.

Martha studied her palm lines and suddenly gasped.

"What is it?"

"Miss Stella, your palm... it's extraordinary." Martha frowned deeply. "Two marriage lines intertwined—I've never seen anything like it."

Stella's heart skipped a beat. "What does that mean?"

"Either it's the same person, or..." Martha hesitated. "The second one has been waiting for you all along."

Stella clenched her fist.

"And also..." Martha's voice dropped even lower. "Your lifeline—"

Before she could finish, a phone rang.

"Stella Valentine!" Victor Valence's voice trembled with excitement. "You're actually the Stella Valentine from Norland College!"

Stella froze. "You attended Norland too?"

"I was five years ahead of you!" Victor gritted his teeth. "All the professors said you'd be the next star in design, but you suddenly dropped out—"

Stella interrupted softly. "I returned home to get married."

Silence filled the other end of the line.

"To Adrian Roland?" Victor's voice turned icy. "Yet he came to my jewelry store with another woman to design an engagement ring."

Stella tightened her grip on the phone. "I remember."

"Stella," Victor suddenly laughed. "Get a divorce. Adrian doesn't deserve you."
###Chapter 122: May I Touch Your Face?

Stella Valentine never expected to hear such words from Victor Valence.

Her fingers tightened around the design sketches, knuckles turning pale.

"Mr. Valence, have you been under too much stress lately?"

Victor leaned against the desk, long fingers tapping the surface. "I'm perfectly lucid. Stella, consider being with me."

"This is absurd."

"How so?" His eyebrow arched. "In terms of family background or career achievements, what makes me unworthy of you?"

She drew a deep breath. "Love isn't a transaction."

"But marriage can be." He stepped closer. "Given your current situation, you need strong backing."

Retreating half a step, her back met the cold wall.

A phone ring shattered the tension.

Victor glanced at the screen impatiently, his expression darkening when he saw the caller ID.

"What?!" His voice sharpened abruptly.

Stella seized the moment to create distance.

"Emergency meeting now!" He hung up, giving her a complicated look. "The company's stocks just crashed."

He strode toward the door but paused abruptly.

"This isn't over, Stella."

The conference room door slammed shut.

She exhaled in relief as her phone vibrated.

【Stay away from him】

Her fingers trembled. 【Did you do this?】

【Just the beginning】

Footsteps sounded behind her.

Stella whirled around, colliding with a familiar chest.

"Mr. Alistair!"

The man's slender fingers traced her lips. "Did he touch you?"

"No." She shook her head. "Why are you here?"

"To check on my little star." His voice lowered. "And warn certain overambitious individuals."

Enclosed in his arms, she felt the rise and fall of his chest.

"How's your recovery?" he suddenly asked.

Her ears burned. "The doctor said... I'm cleared."

A low chuckle warmed her ear. "Then tonight—"

"Wait!" She frantically stopped his wandering hands. "We're at the office!"

"So?" He deliberately leaned closer. "Makes it more exciting."

"Mr. Alistair!"

"Fine, I'll stop teasing you." Releasing her, his expression turned serious. "Promise me one thing, Stella."

"What?"

"Don't believe anything Victor says."

She froze. "Why?"

"Because..." His voice turned dangerous. "I'm jealous."

A searing kiss claimed her mouth.

Forced to arch backward, she surrendered to his possessive embrace.

Only when footsteps approached did he reluctantly release her.

"Tonight." He nipped her earlobe. "Remember to lock the door."

Legs weak, Stella watched him leave with effortless grace.

Her phone buzzed again.

【Remember what I said】

Touching her swollen lips, her heart raced like thunder.

......

"Stella, your mouth..."

The next morning, a colleague gave her a knowing look.

She instinctively covered her lips. "Just... a heat rash."

"Oh~" The colleague smirked. "Must be quite the fever."

Blushing, Stella escaped to her office.

Victor entered as she organized her designs.

"Sleep well last night?" His tone carried implication.

She didn't look up. "Perfectly, thank you."

"Really?" His冷笑. "Seems someone got there first."

Her head snapped up. "Mind your words, Mr. Valence."

"Stella," he leaned over her desk, "you actually think he cares for you?"

"That's none of your concern."

Straightening, he sneered. "You'll learn the truth soon enough."

The door slammed shut behind him, leaving icy silence.

Stella's grip tightened around her pen.

Her phone screen lit up.

【Don't listen to his lies】

She bit her lip. 【What are you hiding from me?】

No reply came.

Until dusk, when a new message appeared:

【Tonight, I'll tell you everything】
###Chapter 123 I Can't Face Her Anymore

Victor Valence had been in a foul mood lately.

The major European jewelry deal he'd secured suddenly fell through. The client demanded a 30% price reduction at the last minute. He had no choice but to fly to Paris overnight with his design team for renegotiations.

Quentin Roland whispered at the airport, "These talks will likely take over a week."

Stella Valentine secretly exhaled in relief. Ever since that unexpected confession, every encounter with Victor left her unsettled. How had this self-proclaimed "eternal bachelor" suddenly changed his ways?

Just as she pondered this, the front desk intercom buzzed.

"Designer Valentine, Mrs. Valois specifically requested to see you."

In the VIP lounge, Eleanor Valois sipped black tea with refined elegance. Her Chanel suit accentuated her aristocratic bearing, sunglasses casually placed on the coffee table.

"Miss Valentine, please sit."

Stella maintained a professional smile as she took the opposite seat. She could sense the hostility radiating from this society matron.

"Let me be blunt." Eleanor produced a blank check from her crocodile leather purse. "Name your price. The condition? Leave Unique Jewelry."

Stella nearly laughed aloud. Was she really living through this clichéd drama?

"Mrs. Valois, you've misunderstood." She pushed the check back. "Victor and I are merely colleagues. Besides..." She paused deliberately. "I'm already a mother of two."

The teacup trembled in Eleanor's hand.

"What?!"

Stella calmly smoothed her skirt. "Your investigation seems incomplete. Victor did confess his feelings, but I believe that was merely his rebellion against your matchmaking pressure."

Eleanor's expression shifted from shock to dawning comprehension. She recalled her son's recent vehement declarations about never marrying—the abrupt change had indeed been suspicious.

"My apologies for the presumption." Eleanor pocketed the check, then pivoted sharply. "But for my son's sake, I still hope you'll resign voluntarily."

Stella's fingertips turned icy.

"Very well." She lifted her chin suddenly. "On one condition."

"Name it."

"My father's car accident six years ago—I need your help investigating it."

Eleanor's pupils contracted briefly before her composure returned. "I'll try. But after so many years, no guarantees."

"Thank you."

......

The Roland ancestral home blazed with light.

Old Mr. Roland paced the parlor with his cane until the front door opened.

"Finally decided to come home?" The patriarch glared at his exhausted grandson. "Off chasing that Lily Savigny again?"

Adrian Roland loosened his tie. "Business meetings."

"Bullshit!" The cane struck the hardwood floor sharply. "The whole city's reporting that woman's scandals today! When will you wake up?"

Adrian collapsed onto the sofa, burying his face in his hands. "Grandfather, my parents' deaths can't go unavenged."

"What does Stella have to do with that?" The old man's voice cracked with anguish. "Shi Feng was at fault! But you married your parents' murderer's daughter for revenge?"

"She abandoned me when I needed her most." Adrian's voice was raw.

Old Mr. Roland gave a mirthless laugh. "Do you still believe that?"

After a prolonged silence, Adrian's shoulders shook slightly. "It doesn't matter anymore... Grandfather, I can't let her go... But I can't face her now..."

The elder sighed deeply, patting his grandson's back. "To err is human, to repent divine."

"Too late." Adrian raised bloodshot eyes. "She's... with someone else now."

"Who?!"
###Chapter 124: The Roland Family's Hidden Twin

Adrian Roland's fingers dug deep into the armrest of the sofa, his knuckles turning white.

"Grandfather, I've looked into it." His voice was hoarse. "Little Star's condition... is serious."

The teacup in Edward Roland's hand trembled violently, spilling tea onto the coffee table.

"Stage four lung cancer." Adrian closed his eyes. "The doctor said... six months at most."

The antique clock in the study ticked heavily, each chime striking like a hammer to the heart.

"She once said her greatest wish was never to see me again." Adrian gave a bitter smile. "I owe her too much. At least now... I shouldn't make things harder for her."

The old man remained silent for a long moment, deep exhaustion etched into his wrinkles.

"What about Lily Savigny?" he suddenly asked. "That child in her belly..."

Adrian's fists clenched abruptly.

The strange scent from that night, the hazy memories—they all made his blood run cold.

"Are you certain it's yours?" Edward's gaze burned like fire.

"I..." Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "I can't remember."

"Foolish!" Edward slammed his palm on the table. "Wait until the child is born for a DNA test! If it's not a Roland, throw her out immediately!"

Adrian suddenly touched his collar, his expression changing drastically.

"Where's your tie?" Edward narrowed his eyes.

"I need to find it!" Adrian stood abruptly, his eyes bloodshot.

Before the old man could stop him, he had already rushed out the door.

Stella Valentine's pencil moved swiftly across the design sketch.

Her creativity flowed unusually well on Victor Valence's first day of absence. The clothing samples Katrina Orlando had sent over inspired new ideas.

Her phone vibrated suddenly, Joy Fairsprene's name flashing on the screen.

"Stella! I'm downstairs at your office!"

Joy's outfit made Stella freeze—a turtleneck sweater, sunglasses, and a face mask, standing out conspicuously under the September sun.

"Are you... being followed by paparazzi?" Stella opened the car door.

"Don't even ask!" Joy yanked down her mask, revealing a swollen lip. "That well-dressed beast Julian Valois!"

Stella instinctively covered her own lip.

"Oh!" Joy's eyes lit up. "You too... your Mr. Alistair must be quite intense!"

"No!" Stella's ears burned. "This was... an accident."

Joy smirked and leaned closer. "I sacrificed so much to dig up some info—Adrian Roland has a twin brother."

Stella's purse dropped onto the car seat with a thud.

"Julian said the child was born with defects and mysteriously disappeared." Joy lowered her voice. "Do you think Mr. Alistair could be..."

Stella's heart skipped a beat.

Fragmented clues suddenly connected—his mention of an unrequited love, his uncanny familiarity with her, those hands that moved effortlessly in the dark...

"What if it's a mental condition?" Joy suggested suddenly. "Like autism spectrum disorder?"

A phone ringtone interrupted their speculation.

"Miss Valentine..." A weak female voice came through the line. "It's Claire Florent..."

In the dilapidated old district, peeling paint fluttered from the walls like dying leaves.

Claire lay on the bed, her body reduced to skin and bones.

"Please..." Her breath was faint. "Oliver hasn't eaten or drunk anything for three days since he learned I'm leaving..."

Stella grasped her skeletal hand. "I'll go see him."

Outside the window, a withered leaf spiraled slowly to the ground.
###Chapter 125: The More I Care, The More I Fear To Offend You

As dusk settled, Stella Valentine and Joy Fairsprene finally arrived at the orphanage.

The setting sun cast long shadows of the iron fence across the yard. Only a few volunteers remained, tidying up toys.

The children's laughter had faded, replaced by an oppressive silence.

"May I ask who you are...?" The director adjusted her reading glasses, eyeing them warily.

Stella tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "I'm a friend of Oliver's mother."

The director's expression darkened instantly.

The office walls were peeling badly, the mottled patches like scars left by time. The director served tea in cups with hairline cracks.

"Oliver's condition..." She hesitated. "The psychologist diagnosed him with Autism Spectrum Disorder."

Joy's cup trembled, spilling tea across the table.

"That child has witnessed too much." The director sighed, wiping the spill. "What adult could endure such blows, let alone a five-year-old?"

Stella withdrew a bank card from her bag, fingers shaking slightly. "Please do everything you can for him."

"This..." The director hesitated. "May I ask about Oliver's mother now...?"

"The doctors say..." Stella's voice was feather-light. "Three months at most."

A terrible silence filled the room.

Oliver's dorm was smaller than expected. Four beds crammed together, the boy sitting alone by the window like a frozen statue.

"Oliver?" Stella knelt to meet his eye level.

The boy turned. His hollow gaze sent chills down their spines.

Joy suddenly covered her mouth, tears spilling over.

"Psychologists say such children build walls around their hearts," the director explained softly. "Unless you're someone truly important to them..."

Stella began humming Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, her voice breaking on the notes.

Oliver's eyelashes fluttered.

Then he suddenly leapt up, shoving everyone out and slamming the door. Heart-wrenching sobs pierced through the wood.

In the car, Joy's nails dug into the steering wheel.

"I'm adopting him," she declared abruptly.

Stella watched the blurring cityscape, a stone settling in her stomach. If one day she... What would happen to Ethan and Luna?

Her phone rang sharply.

"Mr. Alistair." Her voice was thick.

A pause on the line. "I'm here."

Those two words made her eyes burn instantly.

She haltingly recounted Oliver's story, her words dissolving into incoherence by the end. Mr. Alistair listened silently until she choked out, "Autism... it must be so painful?"

"It's like..." His voice softened unexpectedly. "Living forever at the bottom of the sea."

The metaphor made her heart constrict.

When they reached the apartment, Julian Valois was pacing anxiously. Seeing Joy's reddened eyes, he immediately wrapped her in his suit jacket.

"Miss Valentine." Julian hesitated. "He's waiting for you."

During the elevator's thirty-second ascent, Stella counted her racing heartbeats. The familiar scent of cedar enveloped her as the door opened.

Mr. Alistair pressed her against the door, his kiss restrained yet tender.

"Don't be afraid." His lips brushed her earlobe.

She clutched his shirtfront, knuckles whitening. "Mr. Alistair, take me."

His breathing hitched audibly. Yet he simply lifted her effortlessly, depositing her gently on the sofa.

"Stella." He traced the dampness beneath her eyes. "The more I love you, the more I must restrain myself from taking advantage."

Moonlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting them in silver.
###Chapter 126: Secrets Exchanged

Three days after visiting the orphanage, Stella Valentine was revising blueprints in the design department when her phone buzzed.

A message from Mr. Alistair appeared: "Stella, Oliver's mother has passed away."

Her charcoal pencil slipped from her fingers and snapped in two.

"Ms. Valentine?" Quentin Roland looked up at the sound.

She bent to pick up the broken pieces. "Just clumsy hands."

Quentin frowned. "You're pale. Should you rest in the lounge?"

"I need to take half a day off."

"Go ahead. You've been pushing yourself too hard since Mr. Valence left for his business trip. But Katrina's order—"

"It'll be done on time."

Stella grabbed her bag and rushed out. A black Maybach waited around the corner. The driver opened the door. "Mr. Alistair sent me."

"To Oliver's home?"

"The funeral home."

The words stabbed through her heart. Memories of her parents' and the Rolands' funerals six years ago flooded back—her standing outside the columbarium in mourning white, Adrian Roland three meters away yet worlds apart.

"Ms. Valentine?" The driver asked gently, "Mr. Alistair wanted me to confirm—are you sure you want to go?"

"Is he there?"

"Yes."

As the car rolled over a speed bump, Stella gripped the seatbelt. "...Never mind. Take me home."

Martha was simmering soup in the kitchen. "You're back early! Some ginseng broth?"

"No, thank you." She forced a smile. "I'll nap."

The master bed still carried Mr. Alistair's scent. As she turned, her fingers brushed something unfamiliar—a silver-gray tie tucked between the mattress and frame. Her first glimpse into his sartorial preferences.

Another tie lay in her wallet. Navy blue, faintly scented with cologne. Left behind by Adrian last year, foolishly kept like a keepsake. Now she tossed it into the trash without hesitation.

She awoke to familiar warmth pressed against her lips.

"My tie..." Mr. Alistair's voice was rough.

Stella retrieved her wallet from under the pillow. "Here."

He cradled it like treasure against his chest. "Thank God it's safe."

"Important?"

"My mother's last belonging."

The answer made her heart tremble. His kisses traced her silhouette in the dark, mapping her contours with devotion.

"Mr. Alistair, today I—"

"I know." He cut her off. "Oliver will be cared for. I promise."

Suddenly, she seized his wrist. "May I ask something?"

"About the girl I mentioned when we first met?"

"Was it me?"

The air froze. His breathing grew labored, warmth ghosting over her collarbone.

"Let's trade secrets." His voice shifted. "One question each."

"Agreed."

"It was you." Each syllable landed like a hammer. "Always you."

Her eyes burned. The final puzzle piece clicked into place.

"My turn." Calloused fingers grazed her cheek. "Stella, do you love me?"

"Yes."

That single word made the man above her shudder violently. His next kiss was wildfire—possessive, desperate, branding her soul.

"Again," he demanded between ragged breaths.

"I love you, Mr. Alistair."

The metallic whisper of a belt unfastening. Fabric rustled as his voice dropped an octave: "Tonight, I'll make sure you remember how it feels to be loved."

Moonlight painted their entwined shadows on the wall—two vines finally finding their way home.
###Chapter 127: As Long As You're Not Him

The night was deep.

His touch was gentler than usual, as if handling a priceless treasure. His kisses feathered across her skin with careful reverence.

Stella Valentine drifted into memories of the last time she'd been treated with such tenderness—six years ago in Milan.

It had been Adrian Roland's birthday. Despite the time difference, she'd received his video call right after class. The man on screen wore a crisp suit, but his eyes sparkled with boyish anticipation.

"Little Star, 87 days until your twentieth birthday," he announced like a human countdown clock.

She propped the phone against her easel, laughing. "Mr. Roland has free time now? Who's running your company?"

"Managing my future wife is more important," he declared without shame. "When the day comes, I'll be at the civil registry at dawn."

His words drew giggles from her passing roommate, who demanded wedding candy. Adrian's ears turned pink on screen, but he lifted his chin stubbornly. "Marrying my own woman is only natural."

On her twentieth birthday, Adrian had indeed flown to Milan. He'd swept her into his arms the moment she returned from teaching assistant duties. That night, she'd discovered lovemaking could hold so many variations.

"Mr. Alistair," she whispered.

His lips lingered at her throat. "Hmm?"

"What was I like when we first met?"

A low chuckle. "Wearing a primrose yellow dress, trembling like a startled rabbit."

Her heart skipped. That had been her outfit at sixteen, during her first visit to the Roland family home.

"Before me...were there others?"

His movements stilled. "Why ask now?"

"Curiosity." She forced lightness into her tone. "I've borne two children, but a man your age..."

"Stella." He cradled her face. "The past doesn't matter."

Moonlight slipped through the curtains, tracing the edges of his mask. She touched the cold metal. "Whoever you are, I love you."

"Truly?"

"Of course." Her lips curved. "As long as you're not Adrian Roland."

The air froze.

After a long silence, he simply pulled her closer. "Sleep."

———

Dawn found Stella waking to sunlight.

The bed beside her was cold. Her phone showed all alarms disabled, with one unread message: [Rest. Martha has the children.]

The aroma of chicken soup wafted from the dining room. Ethan Valentine was devouring a drumstick when he spotted her and charged over. "Mommy! Martha said you and Daddy were fighting last night!"

Stella choked on air.

Martha Clementson bounced Luna Roland in her arms, smirking meaningfully. "Children don't understand—some fights between husband and wife are good."

"Did Daddy win?" Ethan pointed anxiously at her neck. "Mommy got hurt here."

Stella clapped a hand over the telltale marks. The mirror showed a trail of crimson from collarbone to chest. As she fumbled for concealer, last night's words echoed: As long as you're not Adrian Roland.

"Mommy!" Ethan whispered conspiratorially. "I saw Daddy this morning!"

Her makeup brush clattered to the floor.

"He's so tall and handsome! Cooler than Iron Man!" The boy waved excitedly. "But Daddy left too fast. I couldn't even call him..."

Stella's throat dried. "You saw his face?"

"Just a little." Ethan's shoulders slumped. "Is Daddy so busy because he needs to make lots of money?"

She pulled her son close, remembering the suit-clad youth who'd carried the world on his shoulders.

"Daddy isn't making money." She kissed his hair. "He's being a superhero."
Twilight deepened as city lights began to glow.

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the glittering skyline, my fingers absently tracing the phone screen.

An unread message glowed on the display. The sender's name made my breath catch.

"8 PM. Our usual place."

Seven simple words that sent my pulse racing.

Three months and seven days since we last met.

I'd deleted every contact, yet failed to erase his shadow from my memories.

Drawing a shaky breath, I checked my watch.

7:45 PM.

Just enough time for light makeup and a presentable outfit.

The mirror reflected a woman with delicate features and crimson lips, but her anxious eyes betrayed her.

The café door chimed as I entered, releasing a rush of chilled air scented with roasted beans.

He waited in the corner booth, his silhouette sharp against the dim lighting.

The black trench coat accentuated his lean frame. His tapered fingers drummed the tabletop.

"You came."

Dark eyes lifted to meet mine, fathomless as midnight.

I forced composure as I sat, accidentally knocking over the sugar jar.

"Still clumsy."

His quiet chuckle accompanied the righting of the container. The gesture transported me to a rainy night three years prior—when those same fingers had held an umbrella over me.

"Did you need something?"

I gripped my coffee cup to steady my trembling voice.

After a weighted pause, he withdrew a manila envelope from his briefcase.

"Look at this."

Inside lay photographs of unfamiliar faces and a document titled "Stock Transfer Agreement."

"What is..."

"Your father's legacy."

His soft-spoken words detonated like thunder.

The cup slipped from my grasp, leaving a dark ring on the table.

As the waiter rushed to clean, all I heard was my own frantic heartbeat.

"You've been investigating this?"

My nails bit into my palms as I searched his gaze for answers.

A slight nod. His expression turned inscrutable.

"Not just me."

The café door swung open again.

A sharply dressed man strode in, flanked by two bodyguards.

"What a coincidence."

His smile didn't reach those arctic eyes.

I knew that face.

The last person who saw my father alive.

His final business partner before the fatal crash.
###Chapter 128: Occupied by Thoughts of You

Ethan's eyes lit up.

"Mom, does Iron Man's son also never get to see his dad?"

I ruffled his hair. "That's right, but he has his mom and sister with him."

Ethan buried his face in my arms, nuzzling against me. "Mom, I'm the happiest kid in the world!"

The words struck a chord in my heart.

Last night, Mr. Alistair had whispered the same thing in my ear.

If he truly was Adrian Roland's brother, his affection for the children made perfect sense.

When Julian Valois had impersonated him, he'd shown no interest in them. But Mr. Alistair remembered Luna's preferred milk formula brand and even prepared Ethan's pencils meticulously.

"Mom, why are you smiling?"

"Mom also thinks she's the luckiest mother in the world."

My phone buzzed abruptly—Joy Fairsprene's name flashed on the screen.

"Stella! Earth-shattering discovery!!!"

Inside the café, I stirred my coffee absentmindedly.

A figure wrapped head-to-toe like an "Arabian" suddenly slid into the seat opposite me.

"Joy?"

She yanked off the headscarf, gasping for air. "I'm boiling alive!"

I eyed her heavy disguise. "Are you being hunted?"

"Worse than hunted!" Joy tugged at her collar. "Look what Julian did!"

The sight of the love bites made my cheeks burn.

"Stella, I've sacrificed so much for you!"

I quickly pushed the iced coffee toward her. "Take your time."

Joy gulped down half the glass before exhaling loudly. "Julian's a complete control freak! He even monitors my water temperature!"

"He cares about you."

"Pfft!" She rolled her eyes. "Enough about that. Julian let slip that Mr. Alistair has liked you for ages, but there's a thorny issue to resolve first."

My pulse quickened. "The car accident?"

"Exactly!" Joy lowered her voice. "If he really is Adrian's brother, then the accident involved his biological parents..."

My phone vibrated again.

A message from Mr. Alistair: 【Did I hurt you last night?】

My lips curved involuntarily: 【Much gentler than Julian.】

【Missing me?】

【No.】

【Liar. Your heartbeat just sped up, and your fingers are trembling.】

The man's perceptiveness never failed to unnerve me.

Joy smirked. "Oho, having a lively chat, are we?"

I swiftly changed the subject. "About Oliver's adoption paperwork..."

Joy sighed. "Still need marriage certification. Julian's willing, but..."

The landline rang before she could finish.

"Hello?"

"Little Star, it's Edward Roland. Could we meet?"

The aged voice on the other end froze me in place.
###Chapter 129: Let Each Other Move On

The glass door of the pastry shop swung open. Stella Valentine stepped out with a paper bag in hand, only to find Edward Roland's military SUV already parked by the curb.

Joy Fairsprene, wrapped in an exaggerated headscarf, nudged closer. "The Roland genes are something else. Ethan looking like Adrian is one thing, but the old man's features? It's like they were carved from the same mold..."

Stella pressed her lips together in silence.

She remembered Adrian mentioning that Edward had been a soldier in his youth. After founding New Frontier Group, he'd retained that military bearing—straight-backed and unyielding.

Now, the silver-haired man stood beside the vehicle, his posture as rigid as a pine tree.

"Grandpa Roland."

"Ah, Stella." His smile was warm. "Last time, the house was in chaos. How about joining me for dinner today?"

When she hesitated, he added, "Just the two of us."

Joy poked her from behind. "Go! He must know something about Adrian's brother!"

The military SUV glided smoothly through the streets.

"What would you like to eat?" Edward asked.

"Your choice."

"Then let's have rice porridge. Good for the stomach."

At the health congee restaurant, Edward nearly tripped on the steps.

"It's nothing," he waved off her concern. "An old injury from my days in the Korean War."

Stella noticed the slight limp in his right leg as they walked.

After ordering, Edward sighed heavily. "Stella, I have a favor to ask today."

"Go ahead."

"Let me see the children." His eyes held quiet pleading. "Just tomorrow. Would that be alright?"

Stella stirred her plain porridge. "Yes. But don't tell Adrian."

"Of course, of course..." He nodded repeatedly before hesitating again. "Is there really... no chance left for Adrian?"

"Grandpa Roland." She set down her spoon. "We both need fresh starts."

Dusk had settled when Stella returned to her apartment.

Her fingers barely grazed the light switch when strong arms encircled her from behind.

"Let me taste what you had for dinner." Mr. Alistair's breath brushed her ear.

The kiss was slow and lingering.

"Rice porridge?" He chuckled. "The old man's being stingy?"

"I ordered it." She tilted her head up to look at him.

In the dim light, his profile appeared strikingly defined. That navy blue checkered tie flickered in the fading light—strangely familiar.
###Chapter 130 Birthday Gift

"Mr. Alistair, this tie..."

He chuckled softly. "Does it look familiar?"

Stella Valentine frowned in thought. "I feel like I've seen it somewhere before. Did my father wear something like this?"

"Don't force yourself to remember." He pulled her closer. "Stella, I have two things to tell you—one good, one bad."

She tilted her face up. "Tell me the bad news first."

"Sophia Durand is more cunning than we thought." His voice darkened. "She made Victor Lefèvre transfer all his assets to her name. The company, properties, stocks—everything belonging to the Valentines now belongs to her."

A chill ran down Stella's spine. "How could they—"

"Don't panic." His hand soothed her back. "The good news is, you still hold 50% of the Valentine shares."

"But after the merger, it's only 25%..."

"It's enough." His whisper brushed her ear. "Go to the company. Learn the situation. With me behind you, all of Houston is your support."

She bit her lip.

The Unique Jewelry project wasn't finished yet. She couldn't abandon it midway.

"No rush." He read her hesitation. "Wait until Ethan starts school and Luna is settled with Martha. Then focus on this."

"Mr. Alistair..."

"Hmm?"

"I met Edward Roland today."

He didn't seem surprised. "Did you have congee?"

"Yes." Her voice softened. "He wants to see the children... tomorrow."

"Should I arrange someone to go with you?"

"No need." She shook her head. "Grandfather Roland is very kind."

A brief silence. "They should meet their great-grandfather."

"...Alright."

"Tired?" He noticed her distraction.

"Just a long day." She changed the subject. "Do you think Joy and Julian Valois will end up together?"

He laughed low. "Your little spy is too obvious."

Her ears burned. "You knew?"

"Julian only told me the parts about me." His tone was knowing. "No other details."

"Mr. Alistair!"

"Don't like me like this?"

Her cheeks flushed. "...Only if it's you."

He kissed her. "My little star is so sweet."

She stiffened. "What did you just call me?"

"Does it matter?" He evaded. "It's still you."

Night fell, leaving only their breaths in the quiet dining room.

He led her to sit. "Eat. I'll feed you."

Deliberately avoiding that name.

"Mr. Alistair." She hesitated. "Your voice sounds... different today."

"Oh?"

"Before, it was hoarse. Now it's just deep."

A soft chuckle. "Maybe from quitting smoking. But you still recognize my voice, don't you?"

She nodded.

The familiar cologne confirmed it was him.

"I'm overthinking things." She mocked herself.

"It's the withdrawal." He leaned closer. "Really not hungry?"

She shook her head.

Then the world spun.

"Ah!"

Pinned beneath him, his kisses burned like wildfire.

"Martha took the kids to the movies." His voice turned rough. "We have time."

Heat flooded her cheeks as she understood.

"May I?" His plea was desperate. "Stella..."

Her throat tightened. "But I'm not—"

"You'll be mine soon." His mouth silenced her protest.

Gentleness gave way to urgency. Dizzy, she opened her eyes.

Moonlight spilled over them. His tie swayed before her—navy blue with a checkered pattern.

A memory flashed.

Eighteen-year-old Adrian Roland had received the exact same tie as a birthday gift.
###Chapter 131: Coincidence or Intention

Stella Valentine's fingers trembled slightly.

Her gaze locked onto the necktie, countless memories flashing through her mind.

"Stella?" Mr. Alistair's voice pulled her back to reality.

She took a sudden step back, her voice tight. "This tie..."

"What's wrong?" He sounded genuinely puzzled.

Under the moonlight, the blue-gray patterned tie stood out starkly. Stella remembered it vividly—six years ago, she had tied it around Adrian Roland's neck with her own hands.

"Who are you?" she demanded sharply.

Mr. Alistair fell silent for a moment before chuckling softly. "So you recognized it."

Her heart nearly stopped.

"My assistant bought it," he said calmly. "He thought it suited me."

"Which assistant?"

"Charlie, the driver who often picks you up."

Stella stared intently at his silhouette. The moonlight outlined his sharp profile, but his expression remained unreadable.

"This tie..." she said hoarsely, "was a limited edition six years ago."

He seemed momentarily taken aback. "Really? I don’t pay much attention to these things."

Suddenly, Stella found it absurd. How could she suspect Mr. Alistair was Adrian? That man was probably with Lily Savigny right now—why would he be her gentle, caring Mr. Alistair?

"I'm sorry," she rubbed her temples. "I'm being oversensitive."

He stepped closer, gently taking her hand. "Because it resembles Adrian's?"

She nodded.

"Stella," his thumb brushed over her knuckles, "I'm not him."

His words were like a sedative. Stella exhaled deeply, watching as he untied the tie and tossed it aside.

"I won't wear it again," he said.

She forced a smile. "Actually... I gave it to him as a birthday gift."

His movements stilled.

"Forget it. It's all in the past." She shook her head. "Everything will be over in thirty days."

Mr. Alistair pulled her into his arms, pressing a kiss to her hair. "Sleep now."

"You're resigning?" Quentin Roland nearly dropped his coffee cup.

Stella neatly stacked her design drafts on the desk. "Personal reasons."

"Victor is returning next week!" Quentin wrung his hands anxiously. "Is it about the salary? We can negotiate!"

"It's not the company." She smiled. "The designs are all completed."

After a long pause, Quentin lowered his voice. "Did Unique Jewelry poach you?"

She laughed. "It really is a family matter."

Seeing her resolve, he sighed. "Then... should we keep the position open for you?"

"No need." She shook her head. "If fate allows, we'll meet again."

After packing her desk, she checked the time. It was time to pick up the kids.

Edward Roland's call came right on cue. "Stella, I’ll have the driver—"

"No, Grandpa." She cut him off. "I'll take a taxi."

Hanging up, she gazed out the window absently. Ever since discovering that tie, an inexplicable unease had settled in her chest.

At the Roland estate, Edward was already waiting.

"Mommy, who's that?" Ethan looked up curiously.

"Your father's grandfather," she answered softly.

Luna babbled in her arms as Benjamin Langley approached with red-rimmed eyes. "Miss Stella..."

"Benjamin." She handed the baby to him. "Luna missed you."

The old man cradled the child, tears streaming down his face. "It's all my fault..."

"It wasn’t your doing," she reassured gently.

Edward walked over slowly, his eyes lingering on Ethan's face. "So alike... just like him..."

Instinctively, Stella pulled her son closer.

"Stella," Edward sighed, "Adrian, he—"

"Grandpa," she interrupted, "let’s just focus on the children today, okay?"

He hesitated but finally nodded. The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground. None of them noticed the silent figure watching from the second-floor window.
###Chapter 132: Dirty Schemes

"Grandfather Roland."

Stella Valentine spoke softly while giving Ethan's hand a gentle squeeze. "Say hello to your great-grandfather."

Ethan tilted his little face upward. "Hello, Great-grandpa! I'm Ethan Valentine."

Ethan Valentine.

The surname made Edward Roland's eyes darken momentarily.

He forced a smile. "Good boy. It's cold outside. Come in quickly."

The living room of the old mansion remained as opulent as ever, yet Stella felt prickles of discomfort down her spine.

Benjamin Langley cradled baby Luna with obvious delight, his wrinkled face full of tenderness. He rocked the infant gently, humming an off-key lullaby.

Stella exhaled in quiet relief.

Thank goodness Adrian hadn't kept Luna with him.

Given Lily Savigny's methods...

She recalled Mr. Alistair's words—this must be what he meant by Luna being well cared for.

Edward was now presenting an array of snacks to Ethan like precious offerings.

The coffee table overflowed with toys—Lego sets, remote-control cars, basketballs and soccer balls, every boy's dream.

The snack wrappers were brightly colored, clearly carefully selected children's treats.

For a moment, Stella felt disoriented.

Could Mr. Alistair's meticulous thoughtfulness have been inherited from Edward?

"Stella," Edward called helplessly. "This little one says he can't accept gifts from strangers without Mommy's permission."

She snapped back to reality, meeting Ethan's questioning gaze.

The boy stared longingly at the treats but stubbornly kept his hands behind his back.

Stella gave a slight nod. "You may accept gifts from Great-grandpa. Remember to say thank you."

"Thank you, Great-grandpa!" Ethan immediately cheered, his face lighting up with a radiant smile.

Edward's eyes sparkled. "Benjamin, look! That smile is exactly like Adrian's when he was little!"

"Indeed," Benjamin cooed at the baby in his arms. "The young master takes after his father, and the little miss resembles her mother. Both will grow into beauties."

"That rascal Adrian was blessed by the heavens to marry Stella." Edward chuckled heartily. "These two precious ones will make my old friends green with envy for life!"

Benjamin suddenly sighed. "If only the elder young master were still—"

"Ahem!" Edward coughed loudly.

Stella's eyes flickered.

She spoke casually. "Grandfather Roland, I heard... Adrian had a twin brother?"

The old man's expression darkened instantly. "Who told you that?"

"So it's true?" she pressed. "Why does the Roland family never mention him? He was also a Roland child—"

"He doesn't deserve it!" Edward slammed the table.

Ethan jumped in fright, scattering Lego pieces everywhere.

Edward immediately softened. "Great-grandpa wasn't angry with you..." He fumbled for a Transformer toy. "Do you like this?"

Ethan nodded timidly.

"Tell Great-grandpa, who's your favorite superhero?"

"I-Iron Man..."

"Good! Next time I'll buy you a whole room of Iron Man toys!"

The doorbell rang abruptly.

Benjamin smiled. "That must be the young master."

Stella glanced at Edward, only to find equal surprise on his face.

Benjamin's hesitant voice came from the foyer. "Miss, may I ask who you are?"

"I'm Adrian's girlfriend, Lily Savigny." A honeyed voice replied. "Our last meeting was too rushed. I came specially today to visit Grandfather."

Edward's face turned stormy. "That won't be necessary. Please leave."

But Lily had already barged in.

Benjamin, holding Luna, couldn't stop her as she strode into the living room in her high heels.

"Oh, Miss Valentine is here too." Lily's gaze swept over Stella before landing on her rounded belly.

Edward shielded Stella protectively. "My granddaughter-in-law brought my great-grandchildren to visit. Miss Savigny, showing up uninvited is rather ill-mannered."

Lily stroked her own abdomen. "Grandfather, I'm also carrying your great-grandchild."

"You—!" Edward trembled with rage. "Adrian doesn't even know how this child was conceived! Do you really think the Roland family collects trash based on baseless rumors?"

Lily's smile froze. "Grandfather, those are all lies—"

"Enough!" Edward thundered. "Stella having an affair? What nonsense are you spouting!"

Lily turned to Stella, venom flashing in her eyes. "She admitted it herself. Ask her if you don't believe me."

Stella gave a light laugh. "Miss Savigny is quite well-informed, isn't she?"

"So you admit it?" Lily pressed her advantage. "Since you've found someone new, stop clinging to Adrian!"

"Clinging to him?" Stella sounded amused. "I'd be delighted if you two were locked together forever and stopped bothering me."

Lily's face twisted. "You—"

"But Lily," Stella's eyes turned icy, "I haven't forgotten about the alcohol you forced down Luna's throat. Those photos were just the appetizer. If you dare touch my children again—"

"Photos? What photos?" Edward looked puzzled.

Lily interrupted hastily. "Stella! Do you think you're special just because you've latched onto some rich old man? The one who gave you that three-million-dollar diamond ring—"

"I'm not as filthy as you." Stella's voice was arctic. "Nor as desperate."

Edward erupted. "Benjamin! Throw this woman out!"

"Grandfather!" Lily shrieked. "She cheated and you're still protecting her?"

Ethan looked up confused. "Mommy, what's cheating?"

Edward immediately covered the child's ears and roared. "Get out! Don't pollute my great-grandson's ears!"
###Chapter 133: Unexpected Disaster

The door burst open.

Adrian Roland stood in the doorway, his entire being radiating tension.

"Grandfather."

Edward Roland slammed his hand on the table. "Perfect timing! Get this woman out of my sight!"

Adrian's gaze locked onto Stella Valentine, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Adrian!" Lily Savigny interrupted with a saccharine laugh, clinging to his arm. "Your grandfather misunderstood me. Explain it to him."

She tugged him toward the sofa.

But his eyes never left Stella.

Stella rose. "Mr. Roland, I'll take the children home now."

"She's the one who should leave!" Edward jabbed a finger at Lily, his voice sharp. "Either she goes, or you both do!"

Lily's smile froze. "Adrian?"

Silence.

"Adrian!" She reached for his hand.

"Enough." He avoided her touch. "You've made your appearance. Let's go."

"I'm tired." Lily flopped onto the couch. "Besides, shouldn't Grandfather know about our engagement?"

Adrian's face darkened.

"What did you promise her?" Edward demanded.

"She... will be my wife." Adrian's voice was hoarse.

"Over my dead body!" Edward shot to his feet. "Stella is the only granddaughter-in-law I recognize!"

Lily leaned against Adrian, smirking. "Once they're divorced, I'll be the rightful Mrs. Roland."

"Shameless!" Edward trembled with rage. "Have you no decency?"

"I only care about the title of Mrs. Roland."

Edward clutched his chest, collapsing onto the sofa, his face deathly pale.

"Mr. Roland!" Stella rushed to support him.

Benjamin Langley panicked. "His heart condition! I'll call an ambulance!"

"No time." Stella forced herself to stay calm. "Ethan, help Great-Grandpa lie down. Benjamin, open the windows."

She turned to Adrian. "Get the car!"

Adrian shoved Lily away and bolted outside.

Lily stumbled against the couch, glaring at Stella. "You ruined everything again!"

"If anything happens to Mr. Roland, you'll pay." Stella loomed over her.

Lily smirked, caressing her stomach. "Even if the old man dies, Adrian will marry me. He only cares about me and our baby now."

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the room.

Stella yanked Lily up by the collar. "Pray he survives."

"Mommy!" Ethan cried out. "Great-Grandpa can't breathe!"

Stella released Lily and hurried to check on Edward.

The old man's lips were blue, his breathing ragged.

"Ethan, protect your sister." Stella gave quick instructions. "Wait for me to come back."

The little boy spread his arms in front of Benjamin, eyeing Lily warily. "I will!"

Stella carefully lifted Edward.

The old man gripped her hand weakly. "Give Adrian... another chance..."

"Focus on getting to the hospital." Stella evaded the plea.

Adrian pulled the car up to the entrance.

The three of them rushed inside.

Stella tended to Edward in the backseat, fanning him continuously.

The car sped toward the hospital.

Medical staff whisked Edward into the emergency room.

Stella slumped onto a bench, her injuries throbbing.

"Stella..." Adrian reached for her.

"Don't touch me!" she snapped.

"You look terrible—"

"Thanks to you." Stella let out a bitter laugh. "Control your precious Lily. Stop letting her hurt people!"

Adrian covered his face in anguish. "Today was an accident—"

"The car crash wasn't!" Stella sprang to her feet. "Your beloved Lily admitted she sabotaged our parents' car!"

"...I know."

"You knew?" Stella's eyes widened in disbelief. "You knew and let her walk free? You're still marrying her? How could you betray our parents like this?!"
###Chapter 134: I Will Set Things Right

"Stella, calm down..."

"You may not care about your parents' lives, but I do! Adrian Roland, I thought you just misunderstood me. I never imagined you could be this heartless! When you believed I killed your parents, you wanted me dead! And now? Has your love for Lily Savigny made you abandon all conscience?!"

Adrian reached for her, but she violently shook him off.

"I never expected she would provoke Grandfather into a heart attack..."

"So you still plan to marry her?" Stella's voice was icy with suppressed fury. "You two deserve each other—heartless monsters."

Adrian's eyes were bloodshot, his knuckles white from clenching his fists.

"If... I can fix this, if I can make everything right again... would you... come back to me?"

"Never," Stella said firmly. "I will never have anything to do with you again in this lifetime."

The emergency room doors swung open.

"Family of the patient?"

"Here!"

Stella rushed forward, leaving Adrian's unfinished words behind.

"Your relation to him?"

"His granddaughter-in-law."

The doctor nodded. "The elderly gentleman is stable but needs rest. This episode was triggered by emotional distress. He must avoid further agitation. Fortunately, he received timely treatment, or the consequences could have been dire."

"I understand."

When Mr. Edward Roland was wheeled out, his trembling hand reached for her.

Stella grasped his frail fingers. "Grandfather Roland, I'm here."

Only then did the old man close his eyes in relief.

"Where's Adrian?"

Stella glanced back to see Adrian at the end of the hallway, taking a call.

"Probably handling company matters."

Mr. Roland weakly shook his head. "It must be that vixen..."

Stella stayed silent.

Whoever was on the phone no longer concerned her.

"Rest, Grandfather. I'll watch over you."

As the old man drifted to sleep, Stella checked her phone, worried about the children at the estate. Lily's aggression this time had been far more brazen than before.

Her phone vibrated.

[The children are safe. Protection arranged. Don't let Lily provoke you. Leave her to me.]

Mr. Alistair's message finally eased her anxiety.

[Why do good people suffer?]

[Justice prevails in the end. Wait a little longer. I will set things right.]

She replied: [I believe in you.]

......

"Lily Savigny, what more do you want?" Adrian's voice was laced with venom.

A light laugh came through the phone. "Adrian, you must want to kill me right now. Too bad there's no evidence. Even if you know the truth, the law can't touch me—unless I confess."

"Name your terms."

"I want to be Mrs. Roland in every sense. Stella ruined my reputation. No one else will marry me now. We had a deal—marry me, wait until the baby is born, and I'll turn myself in. A life for a life. I'll donate my lungs to Stella. She gets to live!"

Adrian listened to her deranged words, exhaustion weighing on him.

Since her lies were exposed, Lily had become a different person—or perhaps this was her true self all along.

"Refuse, and I might just decide I don't want to die after all." Lily's laugh was chilling. "Then poor Stella and those motherless children will suffer—"

"I agree!" Adrian cut her off.

"Tsk tsk. For Stella, you'd give up everything—wealth, dignity..."

"Enough!"

Hanging up, Adrian slumped against the wall.

His phone rang again.

"What now?" he snapped.

"Adrian? It's me." Julian Valois's voice came through. "The kids are safe. Jason's men are in position."

"...Thank you."

"Finally coming to your senses." Julian exhaled in relief. "When you first approached me as 'Mr. Alistair,' I genuinely thought you had dissociative identity disorder."

Adrian gave a bitter laugh. "It's always been me, hasn't it?"
###Chapter 135: Fate Has Its Own Plans

"The doctor said it's stress-induced dissociative disorder. To be precise, I did develop a second personality, but it's still me."

"It's the version of you that loved Stella Valentine with all your heart. Remember the first thing you said when you came to me that night?"

Adrian Roland gave a bitter smile. "I remember. I said—'Give me a cigarette.'"

Julian Valois sighed. "You smoked the entire night. The floor was littered with cigarette butts. I was afraid you'd smoke yourself to death."

Adrian gazed out the window. "The stars were beautiful that night."

"Beautiful, yes. And you wasted an entire bottle of my cologne!"

"I had no choice. She couldn't stand the smell of smoke."

Julian fell silent for a moment. "You still love her, even while hating her. Adrian, I thought Joy and I had it rough, but you... When did you finally come to your senses?"

"When I discovered Lily Savigny and her mother were the real culprits behind the car accident."

Julian's eyes widened. "It was really them?"

"Yes." Adrian rubbed his face in anguish. "Looking back now, I should be grateful for 'Mr. Alistair.' If he hadn't appeared, Stella and I would have been finished for good."

"But she still rejects you."

"Yet she likes Mr. Alistair."

Julian frowned. "What happens when she finds out you're him? Will she accept it?"

Adrian's expression darkened.

She had said any identity was fine—as long as it wasn't Adrian Roland.

As long as it wasn't him.

"I don't know," he admitted hoarsely. "But I can't let her go."

"I understand." Julian sighed. "But are you really content to meet her only as Mr. Alistair? Sneaking around in the shadows?"

Adrian pressed his lips together. "Once I settle everything, I'll face her properly."

"What things?"

"Reclaiming the Valentine family's assets. Investigating the accident. Making the culprits pay. Clearing her name."

"What about Lily's child?" Julian asked, confused. "How did you let that happen?"

Adrian looked exhausted. "She drugged me."

"Drugged you?!" Julian's shock quickly turned to suspicion. "Something's off. Joy overheard the doctor at the hospital say Lily couldn't conceive. And with her mother behind her..."

Sophia Durand was far more cunning than her daughter.

The car accident. Lily's calculated approach. Ethan's leukemia. Luna accidentally consuming alcohol...

Thinking of what the children had endured, Adrian clenched his phone until his knuckles turned white.

"None of them will get away with this."

A rustling sound came through the phone. Julian lowered his voice. "Joy's awake. I have to go. I'll keep this between us until you're ready."

"Thanks, brother."

Julian's tone lightened. "I should be thanking you. If not for this mess, Joy and I might never have..." He chuckled. "Never mind. I need to cook for that girl."

Hearing his friend had found happiness, Adrian felt a faint warmth in his chest.

Soon.

Once everything was settled, he would go to his Stella.

"Oh," Julian added suddenly, "Joy's been asking about your 'brother.' They might suspect Mr. Alistair is connected to him. If she truly can't accept you... maybe you could use that identity—"

"I'll think about it."

......

In the hospital room, Stella carefully noted the nurse's instructions.

"Why do you need cotton swabs?" the nurse asked.

"After general anesthesia, patients can't drink water. Cotton swabs help moisten their lips."

The nurse looked surprised. "Are you in the medical field?"

Stella shook her head. "Just learned from experience."

Handing over the swabs, the nurse smiled at Mr. Edward Roland. "Your granddaughter is very thoughtful."

Though still groggy, the old man managed a weak smile.

Stella corrected gently, "I'm not—"

"Then you are...?"

"His granddaughter-in-law. For now." She paused. "We're getting divorced soon."

The nurse tactfully excused herself, nearly bumping into Adrian at the door.

He stepped aside to let her pass before entering the room.

The moment Mr. Edward saw him, his expression darkened. "Go away..."

Adrian remained still. "Grandfather, I'm staying to take care of you."

"I want my great-grandchildren... Not you!" the old man insisted weakly.

Stella picked up her bag. "Mr. Roland, I should go. The children are waiting at home."

Edward clutched her sleeve. "Come back..."

"I'll bring them to visit," she promised softly. "But the divorce is happening. There's nothing left between Adrian and me but pain. No point forcing it. He'll move on. So will I."
###Chapter 136: What Stands Between Us?

Edward Roland's aged hands trembled slightly, his eyes rimmed red. "Stella, is there really... no chance for Adrian?"

The plea in the old man's voice made Stella Valentine's chest ache.

"Grandfather Edward, regardless of what happens between Adrian and me, you'll always be Ethan and Luna's great-grandfather."

The implication wasn't lost on him. He sighed deeply. "The Roland family has wronged you."

"I should go. Please rest well."

"Adrian, escort her—"

Stella shook her head immediately. "No need. I'll take a cab."

But Adrian Roland was already standing. "I'll drive you. We should discuss custody arrangements."

"There's nothing to discuss."

"The divorce papers didn't specify custody terms." His voice was low.

Stella whirled around and strode out of the hospital room.

Edward pounded the bedside in frustration. "Foolish boy, go after her!"

Adrian gently tucked the blanket around his grandfather. "I'll bring her back."

"Go now!"

Outside the hospital entrance, Stella spotted the familiar black Porsche immediately.

This car held too many memories.

After the accident six years ago, the license plate had changed from 0826 to 0000—like a declaration that everything had reset to zero.

"Lost in thought?"

That familiar voice behind her made her heart skip. For a fleeting moment, she thought it was Mr. Alistair. Then reality reasserted itself—it was broad daylight.

"The children stay with me." She cut straight to the point.

Adrian's gaze was complicated. "Let's talk in the car."

"Unnecessary."

"I won't force you to do anything." His voice softened. "The kids are waiting."

At the mention of Ethan and Luna, Stella reluctantly took the passenger seat.

When Adrian leaned toward her, she stiffened. "What are you doing?"

"Just buckling your seatbelt." His smile was bitter. "I always did that before."

"I'll do it myself."

The car merged into sluggish traffic.

Enclosed in this space, memories flooded back.

During her Milan study abroad, he'd wait in this car outside campus. She'd rush into his arms like an excited bird, and he'd always fasten her seatbelt with such care.

Those sweet moments felt like another lifetime now.

"You don't need to guard against me like this." He broke the silence.

"It's not guarding. It's boundaries." She stared out the window. "After divorce, we're strangers."

"I'm still their father."

"You can visit with prior arrangements."

His grip on the steering wheel tightened. "Do you really hate seeing me that much?"

"Yes."

"I know I was wrong—"

"It doesn't matter anymore." She cut him off. "The only thing left to discuss is the children."

"Fine." He inhaled deeply. "I want them two days each week."

"That's too frequent."

"It's standard court-approved visitation." He paused. "I'll take good care of them."

After a silence, Stella conceded. "On one condition."

"Name it."

"Lily Savigny stays away from my children." Her voice turned icy. "Not even once."

"Agreed."

She blinked in surprise. "You don't trust her either?"

"Trusting her once cost too much." Shadows crossed his eyes. "I know it's too late for apologies, but I'll spend my life making it up to you and the kids."

Stella tucked a loose strand behind her ear. "Drop me off ahead."

"Stella..."

"Is there something else?"

Adrian's whisper was nearly inaudible. "What exactly... stands between us?"
###Chapter 137: No Other Choice

Why must fate play such cruel tricks?

The answer was painfully clear.

This was destiny.

Adrian Roland finally relented, settling her beneath a street sign.

Stella Valentine hailed a cab and gave the address.

As the car pulled away, she kept looking back.

Only when the black Porsche didn't follow did she exhale in relief.

Then she smiled bitterly at herself.

Why would she think he'd chase after her?

He was about to become another woman's husband, another child's father.

To him, she was perhaps just another regret in life.

But life was long, and regrets were plentiful. She was merely one among many.

The night sky had countless stars—what difference did one faint glimmer make?

Lily Savigny was his sun now.

Her phone buzzed, interrupting her thoughts.

[The children are home safe.]

A message from Mr. Alistair.

The tension in her shoulders eased.

She wasn't completely alone.

She still had the children... and him.

A wild thought crossed her mind: If Mr. Alistair couldn't meet her in daylight due to his psychological barriers, perhaps this arrangement wasn't so bad.

But what if he really was Adrian's twin brother?

"Driver, please turn around. Take me to Rosewood Gardens instead."

The cabbie chuckled warmly. "Changed your mind, miss? Rosewood's lovely! My son and daughter-in-law live there. Happy as clams—just had their second baby this year!"

His weathered face glowed with contentment.

"Money's tight, but health is wealth, eh?"

Such simple words, yet they warmed her heart.

Kindness still existed in this world.

The moment she opened the door, Ethan crashed into her arms.

"Mommy!"

"Who brought you home?"

"Daddy's driver! Luna drank her milk and fell asleep!" The boy lowered his voice conspiratorially. "Mommy, if Luna sleeps so much... did she get that from you?"

Stella couldn't help laughing. "Why not from Daddy?"

"Because Daddy's a superhero!" Ethan's eyes sparkled. "He's saving the world—no time for naps!"

The innocent words made her eyes sting.

"Mommy, that was Daddy today, right?" Ethan suddenly grew serious. "But why was there another lady with him?"

The question sliced through her like a dull blade reopening an old wound.

"Mommy and Daddy might not stay together forever." She stroked his soft hair. "But we both love you and Luna very much. And your... new daddy will love you too."

"New daddy?" Ethan tilted his head. "But Mommy, the new daddy I saw at home looks exactly like the daddy we saw today!"

The words struck like thunder.

"You're... sure?"

The boy nodded emphatically. "He left in a hurry that day, but now I'm certain—they're the same person!"

Stella's face drained of color.

Joy Fairsprene's call came at that exact moment.

"Stella! It's confirmed!" Her friend's voice crackled with excitement. "Mr. Alistair must be Adrian's identical twin!"

"But what if—"

"No what-ifs!" Joy interrupted. "Julian Valois swore Adrian never wears cologne, but Mr. Alistair always smells of eau de toilette. Their personalities are polar opposites—one gentle, the other ice-cold!"

Every piece of evidence was irrefutable.

Then why did her heart still feel suspended midair?

That complicated matter Mr. Alistair kept mentioning...

"Wait!" Joy gasped. "I think I know why!"
###Chapter 138: Trembling Fingertips

"Why do you say that?"

"Think about it! Adrian and his brother are blood-related, yet just because the elder has mental illness, their parents completely abandoned him. All these years, they've treated Adrian as their only son, as if they've forgotten the other even exists! He must be seething with resentment, wanting to reclaim the family fortune that rightfully belongs to him!"

Stella frowned slightly. "...Sibling rivalry? But Mr. Alistair isn't lacking in wealth..."

"This isn't about money. It's about dignity!" Joy declared firmly. "I can picture his life trajectory—abandoned by his parents as a child, forced to watch his younger brother bask in glory while stealing the woman he loved. Before, he had no power to fight back. But now that you're divorced and he's gained influence, isn't this the perfect moment for revenge?"

"...Is that really the case?"

"Absolutely!" Joy sounded exhilarated, as if she'd uncovered a hidden truth. She softened her tone. "Stella, Julian was right—life is a series of goodbyes and new encounters. Don't cling too tightly to the past. Living in the present is what matters most."

Stella chuckled lightly. "Did he tell you that?"

"Yes," Joy grumbled. "He definitely knows more than he lets on, but he doles out information like squeezing toothpaste. I'm starting to think he's doing it on purpose—setting traps for me to fall into!"

"Joy... I actually envy you."

"Envy me?" Joy's voice rose in disbelief. "You have no idea how infuriating Julian can be—"

Listening to her friend vent about Julian's "misdeeds," Stella felt an unexpected calm settle over her.

Those so-called "misdeeds" were nothing more than Julian scheming to make Joy his secretary—forcing her to accompany him to work, refusing to let her leave after hours. Using tidbits about Mr. Alistair as bait to keep her close, dragging her along for grocery runs, cooking together, watching TV, and finally falling asleep in each other's arms.

"All calculated moves!" Joy huffed indignantly. "Stella, if there's anything else you want to know, I'll squeeze it out of Julian these next few days. Once I get the intel, I'm out of here!"

Joy yearned for freedom.

Julian longed for the warmth he'd lost and regained.

Perhaps they were right for each other, but fate kept bringing them together at the wrong time.

What about her and Adrian?

A decade-long love story that had spanned most of her life. Had they been wrong for each other from the start, or had all those years been a mistake?

No one could say for certain until the very end.

Joy might be naive, but Stella understood Julian's intentions.

He'd known all along that Joy had returned to him solely to uncover information about Mr. Alistair. Through her, he was sending Stella a message: focus on the present, don't dig too deep.

If even Julian was saying this... Mr. Alistair's past must have been far from kind.

"Miss Stella, dinner's ready!"

In the dining room, Martha had prepared chicken wonton soup.

Little Ethan helped set the table, though Martha wouldn't let him near the hot dishes.

The boy bounded over. "Mommy, is Daddy coming home late again today?"

"...Probably."

"I really want to eat with Daddy..."

Stella took his hand and led him to the table. "There will be chances."

After dinner, the sky hadn't yet darkened.

Mother and son were both waiting for the same person.

Martha smiled knowingly. "Miss Stella, why not take Ethan for a walk downstairs? Once it gets dark, Mr. Alistair will be back!"

Flushing at being seen through, Stella's ears burned. "I... wasn't waiting for him."

Martha's smile deepened. "Missing him is natural. I'm sure he's thinking of you too—he might already be on his way."

A sudden worry gripped Stella.

She pulled out her phone and texted: 【Drive carefully.】

Beep—

【How was the wonton soup?】

【You knew we were having wonton soup? Did you ask Martha to make it?】

【Her recipe has changed. Does it still suit your taste?】

【It's delicious.】

【Good.】

【Mr. Alistair, the weather's getting colder. The nights come earlier now.】

【And?】

【And... that means I can see you sooner.】

This time, the reply didn't come immediately.

It was the first time she'd ever bared her heart like this in a text. Stella's cheeks burned, her pulse quickening.

How would Mr. Alistair respond?

The wait stretched on, her phone remaining silent.

Doubt crept in. Had she been too forward?

But shouldn't he be happy? Why wasn't he replying?

Ring—

The phone lit up with his call. Stella answered instantly. "Hello?"

"Stella..."

"Why didn't you reply? Did you... not like what I said?"

"How could I not like it?" His exhale was heavy with satisfaction. "It's just... after reading your message, my fingertips were trembling."

"..."

"I kept making typos, deleting and rewriting. In the end, I couldn't take it anymore—I had to call you." His voice brimmed with unconcealed joy. "Stella, I miss you."

Stella laughed softly. "You sound just like Ethan. Even if we're apart for five minutes, he says he misses me when we meet again."

"Me too. Stella, even if we're separated for only five minutes, I'll still miss you desperately when we reunite."

Stella bit her lip, her face aflame. "You... wait a moment."

Covering the receiver, she hurried to the balcony in flustered haste.

Behind her, Ethan and Martha's quiet laughter followed.

"Martha, is Mommy feeling shy?"

"More than shy—she's feeling sweet."

"What's sweet? Like candy?"

"Sweeter than candy."

Though Ethan didn't fully understand, as long as Mommy was happy, so was he.

Whether it was his new daddy or old daddy, any daddy who could make Mommy smile was a good daddy!

On the balcony, the cool breeze soothed her heated cheeks. Stella took a deep breath. "Okay, you can keep talking now."

His amusement deepened. "Embarrassed?"

"...No."

"Then why hide on the balcony?"

Stella blinked. "Can you see me? Are you back?"

"Mmm. Waiting for nightfall, just like you."

"..."

"But the sun is being stubborn, refusing to clock out." He sighed in mock lament. "If the sun won't leave, how can the little star come out to play?"

The term "little star" sent a tremor through her heart.

"Mr. Alistair."

"Yes?"

Summoning her courage, she whispered, "Can I... come down to see you now?"
###Chapter 139: Reunion

"Stella..."

Stella Valentine gently interrupted, "Mr. Alistair, you're afraid I'll leave once I see your true face, aren't you?"

A sigh came through the phone. "Not afraid. Certain. The moment you know who I am, you'll walk away without looking back."

"You promised not to lie to me."

"And I haven't. I've held nothing back."

The corners of Stella's lips lifted. "As long as you're not Adrian Roland, I'll accept whoever you are."

Silence filled the line.

"Mr. Alistair?"

"What if..." His voice trembled slightly. "What if I look exactly like him?"

To his surprise, Stella's tone remained light. "As long as your soul isn't his, the resemblance doesn't matter."

Adrian let out a bitter laugh. "Right. As long as the soul is someone else's..."

He recalled Julian Valois's warning—both Joy Fairsprene and Stella now believed "Mr. Alistair" was his long-lost twin brother.

"Alright. I'll wait for you downstairs."

"I'm coming right now!"

If playing the role of his brother was what it took...

Adrian closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He didn't care about the disguise, as long as he could hold her again.

At least he wouldn't have to hide anymore.

Stella grabbed her phone and dashed out, only realizing at the doorstep that she was still wearing her fluffy slippers.

Her heart pounded wildly, cheeks burning.

"Where are you?"

"Turn around. Look to your right."

In the small garden, a figure approached slowly.

Time seemed to stretch endlessly.

The black suit accentuated his tall frame. A light blue tie. Gold-rimmed glasses. And that face—identical to Adrian's.

Stella's breath hitched. "...Mr. Alistair?"

He opened his arms. "Stella, come here."

On the third-floor balcony, Ethan clapped excitedly. "It's Daddy! Martha, look!"

Martha Clementson stared in shock at the man whose features mirrored the little boy's.

"Daddy's so handsome!" Ethan stood on tiptoe, eyes sparkling. "Mommy's running into his arms!"

"Ethan, close your eyes!"

"Why?"

"Because..." Martha thought quickly. "Daddy's transforming into a superhero."

Ethan immediately covered his eyes. "What about Mommy?"

"She's being protected by Daddy."

"When can I watch Daddy transform?"

Martha gently smoothed his hair. "Tonight, Mommy and Daddy are saving the world. How about I stay with you?"

Downstairs, Adrian caught Stella as she threw herself into his embrace.

He wanted to crush her against him, yet feared hurting her injuries.

"You're really Mr. Alistair?"

"Of course."

The familiar scent of citrus-and-alcohol cologne enveloped her.

"You've been through so much," Stella murmured, tilting her head up.

The twilight softened his sharp jawline, leaving only tension visible.

"Joy told you?"

"She mentioned some things." She rested her head against his chest. "Why did the Rolands never speak of you?"

"Probably..." His arms tightened around her. "They thought I was gone."

Tears welled in Stella's eyes.

The last time she'd been held like this was when she returned from studying abroad.

Her flight had been delayed until 3 a.m., yet Adrian waited in the cold wearing only a thin shirt.

"Silly. Why didn't you wait inside?"

"You're afraid of the dark." He'd cupped her face. "From now on, I'll meet you in every shadowed place."
###Chapter 140: Tides of Longing

2:45 AM.

Stella Valentine slept soundly in Adrian Roland's arms.

The woman who had promised to stargaze with him was now deep in slumber against his chest.

Adrian tightened his embrace slightly, pulling her closer.

His phone lit up in the darkness.

The flashing number darkened his gaze. "Speak."

"Mr. Roland, Mr. Xavier requests your presence tomorrow morning."

"Reason?"

"The same matter as before."

"..."

"Will you go?"

"Time to end this."

......

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, pooling at the edge of the bed.

Stella opened her eyes to find Ethan blinking up at her from where he perched on the mattress.

"Mommy!"

The little boy launched himself at her, wrapping his arms around her neck. "I missed you so much!"

She pulled him under the covers, fingers threading through his soft hair. "Why are you up so early?"

Ethan burrowed against her. "Mommy, did you and Daddy fight monsters last night?"

Stella froze. "...Who told you that?"

"Martha said Daddy's a superhero!" Ethan's eyes sparkled. "Did he use laser vision to beat the bad guys?"

A laugh escaped her.

Mr. Alistair had indeed been heroic last night.

His warm palms enveloping her cold feet. His scorching kisses tracing her lips.

"Daddy's very special," she murmured.

Ethan pouted. "Uncle Hugo says I have to grow up before I can see Daddy transform."

Stella studied her son's innocent face.

This sunshine child was Adrian's gift to her.

"Mommy, when will I be grown up?"

"Soon." She brushed his cheek. "Daddy found you a new school."

"Then can I see his superpowers?"

"When Daddy comes home, I'll ask him."

Her phone screen illuminated.

[Awake?]

Her lips curved. [Yes.]

[Sleep well?]

[Very.]

[Good.]

She hesitated. [We don't have to text now.]

[Stella, I'm not ready to talk face-to-face yet.]

She suppressed a smile.

Who would believe the ruthless CEO could be this shy in private?

[Coming home for dinner?] She added after a beat: [Ethan wants to see you.]

[And you?]

Her cheeks warmed. [Me too.]

[Too what?]

This infuriating man.

[I miss you.]

[I'll return early.]

[Waiting.]

"Mommy! What did Daddy say?" Ethan bounced impatiently.

"Daddy promised to come home early for dinner with you."

"Yay!" The boy cheered. "I finally get to meet Super Daddy!"

Stella squeezed his small hand. "Remember what Mommy told you? The Daddy at Great-grandpa's house is different from the Daddy now."

Ethan tilted his head. "But they look the same."

"Like twins."

"But..." He scratched his head. "Mommy, I think they're the same person."

Stella dismissed it as childhood confusion.

She was grateful for Ethan's cheerful nature—he adored both "Daddies" equally.

Likely thanks to Hugo Merovingian's devoted care in Switzerland.

......

Houston Grand Hotel Penthouse.

Adrian stood before carved wooden doors.

"Enter." A gravelly voice summoned.

By the floor-to-ceiling windows, an elderly man in traditional attire sipped tea with his back turned.

"Uncle Xavier."

The man rotated slowly. "Sit."

"You wanted to discuss something?"

Mr. Xavier lifted a celadon teacup. "Try the new Wuyi Rock tea?"

"Skip the pleasantries." Adrian met his gaze directly. "State your business."

"Remember our agreement?"

The rainy night six years ago flashed before him.

Parents dead. Empire in ruins. Mr. Xavier had offered rebirth.

For three promises.

First: Surpass the Shi family within two years.

He'd succeeded.

Blinded by hatred then, he'd only wanted to prove himself to Stella.

Later she returned as his docile wife.

Yet he'd kept hurting her.

Until Mr. Alistair emerged.

His gentler self who cherished only her.

By day, the ruthless Adrian Roland. By night, the tender "Mr. Alistair."

Until that fateful moment—

When both souls finally merged.
###Chapter 141: A Woman's Lies

"Adrian, we need to talk."

"Uncle Xavier, I was thinking the same."

The older man studied him for a long moment before chuckling low. "Seems you've already guessed what I want to discuss."

Adrian remained silent with a slight nod.

"I never had children of my own. Now all I want is to find a worthy successor." Xavier traced the rim of his teacup. "I chose you because of your capability and determination."

Adrian lowered his gaze.

"I helped you rebuild your empire. Paved the way for you. The condition was your undivided focus on business." Xavier took a slow sip. "Yet now, you seem to have forgotten our agreement."

"I'll never forget what you've done for me."

"And yet?" Xavier's laugh was cold. "Women are masters of deception. She abandoned you when you were at your lowest. Now that you've regained your fortune, she comes crawling back. Can't you see through such an obvious ploy?"

Adrian's fingers twitched, though his voice stayed even. "Lily is carrying my child."

"Still putting on this act for me?" Xavier shook his head. "I know exactly who holds your heart."

Silence stretched between them.

"We all lose our heads over love when we're young." Xavier sighed. "When you reach my age, you'll understand—love is nothing but lies women spin to ensnare men."

"Uncle Xavier—"

"I was nearly destroyed by a woman's deceit." Xavier abruptly rolled up his pant leg, revealing a metallic prosthetic. "This is the price I paid! She swore to care for me, then ran off with my money and another man!"

Adrian's fists clenched. "Stella is different."

"All crows are black under the same sky!" Xavier snapped. "Stella, Lily—which one hasn't lied to you?"

"Stella would never—"

"Enough." Xavier raised a hand. "You still owe me two favors. Now I'm calling in the second one."

Adrian's head jerked up.

Xavier heaved himself back into his chair, breathing heavily. "I want you to leave Stella. In return, I'll help you uncover the truth about your parents' accident."

———

Night fell, city lights flickering to life.

Adrian stood outside the rose garden apartment building, cigarette smoke curling around him. His phone buzzed amidst the haze.

[Come home quick Daddy! Mommy made SO much yummy food!]

The corners of his lips lifted. Stella must have put their son up to this—she was always so shy about expressing affection directly.

[Tell Mommy to open the door]

The elevator doors slid open just as the apartment door swung inward. Stella gripped the handle, suddenly meeting his intense gaze.

"Mommy! Is it Daddy?" Ethan peeked out from behind her, tilting his head before frowning. "Daddy, where's your superpower?"

"What superpower?"

"Martha said you're a superhero!" The boy circled him excitedly. "Where's your cape?"

Adrian laughed, scooping him up. "Heroes have to keep their identities secret."

His free hand found Stella's, fingers lingering over her bare ring finger.

"Are you free soon?" he murmured.

"Hmm?"

"You've designed so much jewelry." He brushed his thumb across her knuckles. "It's time you created a ring for yourself."

The tips of Stella's ears turned pink as she pulled away, fleeing toward the kitchen. "I-I should help Martha."

Adrian watched her retreating figure, warmth softening his gaze.
###Chapter 142: A Father's Promise

Martha deftly placed the final dish on the dining table.

"Miss Stella, you go ahead to the dining room. I'll take care of things here."

Stella Valentine lingered awkwardly by the kitchen doorway. "Let me help—"

"No need," Martha interrupted, effortlessly balancing four plates. "I've been doing this for decades. See? I can carry this many at once."

Stella fell silent, watching the older woman's practiced movements.

"Stella." Mr. Alistair's deep voice called from the living room.

She took a steadying breath before stepping out.

The modest three-bedroom apartment felt even smaller with the children's belongings scattered everywhere. Ethan's toys littered the floor while Luna's baby essentials crowded the sofa.

Mr. Alistair's tall frame dominated the cramped space. He sat cradling Luna in one corner of the sofa, with Ethan perched on his lap, playing with his baby sister.

The sofa was too low for him. His long legs folded awkwardly, yet he didn't seem to mind as Ethan clambered over him.

"Ethan," Stella called softly. "Dinner's ready."

The boy remained oblivious, completely absorbed in his newfound father.

"Daddy!" Ethan looked up excitedly. "Can superheroes do anything?"

Mr. Alistair's lips curved slightly. "We can try."

"Can you fly with me?"

"That's too dangerous."

Ethan pouted briefly before perking up again. "Will I get superpowers when I grow up?"

"Of course."

"Then I can protect Mommy!"

Mr. Alistair's gaze softened as it met Stella's. "Daddy will protect Mommy."

"What about me?"

"You'll protect your sister."

Ethan blinked in confusion. "But who will I protect then?"

Mr. Alistair ruffled his hair. "When you're older, you'll meet someone special. That's who you'll protect."

"Is Mommy your special person?"

Meeting Stella's eyes, Mr. Alistair nodded solemnly. "Yes. Daddy will always protect Mommy. And I'll protect you and your sister until you're grown."

Ethan whooped and threw himself into Stella's arms. "Thank you, Mommy!"

She stroked his back. "For what?"

"For finding me and Luna such a good daddy!" Ethan beamed. "But it'd be even better if Daddy could play video games with me!"

Mr. Alistair responded immediately. "After dinner, we'll beat that level together."

"Yes!"

Both children were unusually clingy that evening. When Martha tried to take Luna, the baby whimpered in protest. Even Stella's attempts to hold her daughter were met with reluctance. Only in Mr. Alistair's arms did the little girl giggle contentedly.

Ethan eagerly served his father a portion of shredded pork with cucumber. "Try this, Daddy! Mommy made it special for you!"

Stella watched Mr. Alistair's expression anxiously. She'd prepared this dish countless times in Milan—it had been Adrian Roland's favorite whenever he visited.

"It's delicious," Mr. Alistair murmured.

Relief washed over her. "I'll make something else tomorrow. Do you like spicy food?"

A pause. "I can handle it."

"Then tomorrow I'll prepare mapo tofu and shredded chicken in hot sauce."

"Good."

Ethan wolfed down his meal before dragging Mr. Alistair toward the nursery. "Daddy, come quick! I can't beat this level!"

With Luna still giggling in his arms, Mr. Alistair settled cross-legged on the floor beside Ethan. Father and son focused intently on the game screen, their laughter filling the room.

In the kitchen, Martha sighed while washing dishes. "Mr. Alistair is even more handsome up close! Ethan looks just like him!"

Stella forced a smile.

Biology worked in mysterious ways. Ethan had always been politely distant with Hugo Merovingian, yet took to Mr. Alistair immediately. And Mr. Alistair indulged the boy's antics with unmistakable affection.

"You've known Mr. Alistair for a while?" Martha probed.

"Only a few months."

Martha's eyes widened. "But Ethan's five..."

Stella didn't explain. Their relationship was too complicated for simple explanations.

"I see," Martha nodded knowingly. "You had a fight before? It's hard when the husband's away during childbirth. But he clearly cares—asks about your meals and health every day..."

As Martha chattered on, Stella drifted into thought.

Wasn't this exactly the life she'd once dreamed of?

A son bright as the sun, a daughter gentle as the moon, and herself—the star between them.

Only...

The man who'd once promised her the world now wore a different face.
###Chapter 143: I'm Not Pitiful, Just Foolish

The freshly bought fruits still glistened with water droplets. Stella Valentine sliced them into an elegant arrangement and carried the platter toward the game room.

Ethan's excited cheers reached her before she even opened the door. "Daddy, you're amazing! You beat the level again!"

Mr. Alistair's deep, pleasant laughter followed. "Ethan, what did you just call me?"

"Daddy," Ethan tilted his head. "Isn't that right?"

"It is," Mr. Alistair ruffled his hair. "But did Mommy tell you that you have another daddy too?"

Ethan nodded. "She said the one we met at Great-Grandpa's house is also my daddy."

"Which daddy do you like more?"

Without hesitation, Ethan answered, "You!"

"Because I'm better at video games?"

"No," Ethan shook his head seriously. "Because you make Mommy smile. Uncle Hugo said the other daddy had another lady with him, and it made Mommy cry for so long. I don't like people who make Mommy cry."

Mr. Alistair fell silent for a moment. "If... that daddy realized he was wrong and wanted to treat Mommy well, would you forgive him?"

Ethan propped his chin in his hands, thinking hard. "Uncle Hugo says it's good to admit mistakes. But..." His little face scrunched up. "He wasn't there when Mommy was sad. What's the point of changing now? I still like you best!"

Stella's heart skipped a beat as she stood at the door.

She cleared her throat softly. Ethan immediately rushed over. "Mommy!"

"Sweetheart," she set the fruit platter down. "Have some fruit."

But Ethan picked up a toothpick first. "Daddy and Mommy should eat first."

Mr. Alistair looked surprised. "Who taught you that?"

"Uncle Hugo said to be polite," Ethan blinked his big eyes. "But at home, we don't have to be so formal, right?"

Once given permission, the little boy happily dug in, not forgetting to remind his baby sister in the crib. "Luna, grow up fast so I can share apples with you!"

Suddenly, Mr. Alistair took Stella's hand and led her into the bedroom.

"Mr. Alistair..."

"Don't be nervous," he chuckled softly. "I just wanted to ask—did you hear everything earlier?"

Stella nodded.

"Then," his voice tightened slightly, "if Adrian Roland truly repented, would you forgive him?"

Her answer was firm. "No. The cooling-off period is almost over. We've been done for a long time."

A complex emotion flickered in his eyes. "Even if he spent the rest of his life making it up to you?"

"Some wounds can't be healed."

......

In a dimly lit bar late at night, Adrian Roland sat with a glass of hot water in front of him.

Julian Valois swirled his whiskey. "Just water?"

"My stomach can't handle it," Adrian smiled bitterly. "She's making spicy food tomorrow."

"What did she say today?"

Adrian downed the hot water in one gulp, his voice hoarse through the rising steam. "She said... she doesn't hate me anymore."

Julian paused. "Isn't that a good thing?"

"No hatred means no care left." Adrian's eyes reddened. "The name 'Adrian Roland' has been completely erased from her heart."

"So what's your plan?"

"Let it be," he stubbed out his cigarette. "At least now, as Mr. Alistair, I can still stay by her side."

Julian frowned. "What about Mr. Xavier Atlante? And Lily Savigny..."

"I don't know." Adrian rubbed his temples wearily. "That night... I have no memory of it."

"The drug was that strong?"

"You know what her mother is capable of."

Julian shook his head. "You're truly unlucky to cross paths with that mother-daughter pair."

Adrian stared at the rippling water in his glass, his voice barely audible. "I'm not pitiful. I'm just... a fool."
###Chapter 144 The Last Call

Julian Valois swirled the amber liquid in his glass, watching it catch the light. "Adrian, have you ever wondered how things would've turned out between you and Stella if Lily Savigny hadn't entered the picture?"

Adrian Roland's fingers tightened around his glass, the crystal emitting a faint crack.

"Her father drove drunk..." Julian's voice lowered. "Can you ever forgive him for your parents' deaths?"

Adrian's collar suddenly felt suffocating. He undid two buttons, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"If none of that had happened..." His voice was hoarse. "Mr. Alistair would've come sooner."

Love and hatred warred inside him. Mr. Alistair had loved Stella for ten years, while Adrian's hatred had festered for six.

Now, it was too late.

Julian's parting words cut like a knife: "Your act is full of holes. She'll learn the truth eventually."

At dawn, Adrian watched the pale light spread across the horizon.

"One more day of hiding is enough."

...

Outside the bar, his phone rang abruptly.

Caller ID: Stella Valentine.

He answered. "Hello?"

Silence stretched on the other end.

"Little Star?"

"Who is this?" Stella's voice was sharp with suspicion.

Adrian's pulse jumped.

"Mr. Alistair?" Her voice trembled. "Why do you have Adrian's phone?"

Cold sweat drenched his back.

He'd forgotten to disguise his voice.

Normally before meeting her, he'd smoke to roughen his tone. But tonight at the bar, he'd already had his cigarette.

Covering the receiver, he cleared his throat and resumed his usual cadence. "It's me."

"...Is it really you?"

"Who else?" He forced lightness into his tone. "Wrong number? Were you looking for your Mr. Alistair?"

"No." Her voice turned glacial. "Just reminding you there are only thirty days left in the cooling-off period. Don't claim you're busy when the time comes."

Each word was an ice pick to his chest.

"That's all?"

"What else is there?" she countered. "This is the only thing left between us."

Adrian's chest constricted. "Little Star—"

"Call me Ms. Valentine," she cut in. "Save that name for someone who deserves it."

"You love him that much?"

"None of your business."

Her voice suddenly steadied. "The children are the only compensation I need from you. Nothing else."

She mentioned the investigation into her father's accident, returning the Roland family assets—each sentence drawing a clearer line between them.

"Finished?" she asked.

"...Yes."

"Goodbye then."

"Wait!" Adrian's voice cracked. "Just once...let me call you Little Star one last time."

A soft inhale came through the line.

"The last time," he said bitterly. "I won't do it again."

Silence expanded.

He could hear her controlled breathing.

Minutes later, the call disconnected abruptly.

The dial tone sounded like a death knell.

At least he still had the "Mr. Alistair" identity.

His other phone rang right on cue. Martha Clementson's anxious voice came through: "Mr. Alistair, Ms. Valentine is crying terribly—"

He hung up hastily, lighting a cigarette and inhaling deeply.

Between coughs, his voice regained its roughness.

When he called back, Martha fretted: "Ms. Valentine locked herself in after that call—"

"Let her be," he said. "Some pain must be endured alone."

Hanging up, Adrian watched the lightening sky.

He knew why Stella was crying.

Not for Adrian Roland, but for the version of herself who'd once loved without reservation.

Martha was bustling in the kitchen when Stella emerged with swollen eyes.

"Mr. Alistair promised he'll stay until you wake up from now on!" Martha said cheerfully. "I'm making your favorite chicken wonton soup for lunch!"

Stella managed a weak smile.

"Oh," Martha suddenly frowned. "His voice sounded odd today..."

"How so?"

"Can't put my finger on it..." Martha shook her head. "Probably just my imagination."

Stella looked out the window where sunlight pierced the clouds.

Like certain truths that would eventually come to light.
###Chapter 145: I'm Ethan, Like the Sun

Martha carried a steaming bowl of chicken wonton soup and suddenly chuckled. "Mr. Alistair came home last night sounding so happy."

Stella looked up from feeding Luna.

"He's so busy with work, yet he still makes time for you." Martha set the bowl on the table. "Last night, he played video games with Ethan and only left after you all fell asleep. Sigh..."

The doubt in Stella's heart instantly dissolved.

Replaced by aching tenderness. He worked all day, then rushed back every night. This had gone on for over a month.

She couldn't help texting him: "How are you not exhausted?"

Her phone vibrated almost immediately: "Why don't you check for yourself?"

Her ears burned as she tossed the phone onto the couch.

If he could still joke like that, he clearly had energy to spare.

Ethan was right—he might truly be an inexhaustible superhero.

"Mom, since Dad isn't here today, what are we doing?" Ethan asked around a mouthful of wonton.

Stella wiped his lips. "We're visiting Grandma—your mom's mother."

"Does she love us like Great-Grandpa does?"

"Of course." She ruffled his hair.

Martha hesitated. "Miss Stella, should I come with you?"

"No need. Please rest."

The doorbell rang suddenly.

Her heart skipped a beat. Had he come back?

A young man in a suit stood at the door. "Miss Stella, Mr. Alistair sent me to pick you up."

It was Charlie, the driver.

"The hospital? Is something wrong with my mother?"

"Your mother is recovering well." Charlie smiled. "Mr. Alistair remembered you mentioning she wanted to see the children."

Martha sighed. "He's so thoughtful."

"Uncle!" Ethan dashed over and grabbed Charlie's hand. "Are you my dad's friend?"

"I'm his subordinate."

"What's a subordinate?"

"Someone who... helps him with things."

Ethan's eyes lit up. "Then can you tell me stories about him? He never has time."

Charlie's smile faltered for a second. "Sure. I'll tell you on the way."

Stella carried Luna while holding Ethan's hand as they went downstairs. Charlie had already installed the child safety seat.

Once the car started moving, Ethan leaned forward. "Uncle, how amazing is my dad?"

"Very."

"Did he ever ride a dragon to save Mom?"

Charlie's grip on the steering wheel tightened. "He's sacrificed a lot for your mother."

"Will they have a happy ending?"

"Of course. That's why you and your sister are here."

Ethan suddenly frowned. "But Mom said we're from our old dad."

The air in the car froze.

Charlie quickly recovered. "But your new dad loves you just the same, right?"

"Yeah!" Ethan nodded vigorously. "Old dad left us, but new dad is the best!"

In the rearview mirror, Stella kept her eyes down, calmly playing with Luna.

Charlie sighed inwardly. Such a perfect couple... why did it have to be like this?

"Miss Stella," he changed the subject, "Mr. Alistair can't show up in person. He's worried your mother might misunderstand."

"I know." She gazed out the window. "He has his reasons."

In the hospital hallway, Charlie insisted on waiting outside the room. "Mr. Alistair's orders. We need to watch out for Victor Lefèvre."

Stella could only nod.

Inside the room, Grace Laurent was chatting with a nurse.

"Mom."

Grace turned. Her pupils contracted sharply.

"This is Ethan, my son." Stella placed Luna in her mother's arms. "And this is Luna."

Grace trembled as she touched both children, tears streaming. "You only told me about your daughter..."

"Grandma!" Ethan stood on tiptoes by the bed. "I'll blow on it so it doesn't hurt!"

Watching them, Stella finally let her tears fall.
###Chapter 146: Who Will Humiliate Whom Remains to Be Seen

Grace's tears spilled over instantly.

Her trembling fingers brushed Ethan's cheek as she choked out, "Grandma isn't in pain. You're such a thoughtful boy."

When her gaze shifted to Stella, Grace sighed softly. "This child...he's the spitting image of Adrian..."

Stella nodded calmly.

She never denied this truth.

No matter what grievances existed between her and Adrian, the children were innocent. She would tell them the truth about their origins. Their future choices would be theirs alone.

Little Luna giggled in Stella's arms, tiny hands waving in the air. Grace extended a finger, which her granddaughter immediately grasped with surprising strength.

"This one takes after you," Grace said, smiling through her tears.

Stella gave a wry smile. "She has traits from both of us. The Roland genes are formidable."

"Silly girl, no matter who they resemble, they're your precious ones." Grace's expression darkened suddenly. "Actually, Adrian was...ah, what a pity."

"Mom, that's all in the past." Stella cut her off firmly. "We'll live our separate lives now. I can take care of the children."

Grace grew agitated. "You're still so young! Raising two children alone is no simple matter. I'll go complete my discharge paperwork right now—"

"I'm twenty-six."

"You'll always be my child." Grace's eyes welled up again. "Remember when you insisted on studying jewelry design? Running off to Milan alone kept your father awake night after night. Thank goodness Adrian visited you often back then—"

She immediately bit her lip in regret.

"Stella, what are your plans now?"

"First, finalize the divorce." Stella's eyes held steely resolve. "Before Lily can cause more trouble."

Grace nodded repeatedly before suddenly choking up. "It's all my fault...if I hadn't pushed you to help your uncle, your father's life's work wouldn't have..."

At the mention of Victor, Stella felt a sharp pang in her chest.

Her good-for-nothing uncle couldn't even grasp basic business operations—how could he possibly manage what her father had built?

"And the Roland family..." Grace said guiltily. "I failed Adrian."

Stella squeezed her mother's hand. "After the divorce and enrolling Ethan in school, I'll handle these matters. Father's shares still belong to me. Victor can't stop me from joining the board."

"But you're still a woman..."

Stella's laugh was icy. "Mom, who will humiliate whom remains to be seen. I will reclaim what Father left behind. The Roland assets will be returned to their rightful owners. Only then will the accounts be settled."

"Money means nothing. I just want you safe—"

The shrill ring of a phone interrupted them.

Seeing the caller ID, Stella frowned slightly. "Mom, I need to take this."

On the balcony, Victor's furious roar assaulted her ears the moment she answered. "Stella Valentine! Do you think my company is some flea market? Coming and going as you please? Get your ass back here now!"

"Mr. Valence, I sincerely apologize—"

"Katrina loves your designs." His tone shifted abruptly. "But I'm deeply unsatisfied! Did you take my confession as harassment? Or did that so-called Mr. Alistair force you to quit?"

"That's not—"

"So he's jealous?" Victor's anger flared hotter. "Bring him out! Let's see what kind of man dares to ruin your career!"

Stella drew a steadying breath. "Family matters required my attention."

Silence.

"Then..." His voice softened. "Who compensates the company's losses?"

"I'll design five jewelry sets free of charge."

"Who wants that?" he scoffed. "Two options: return to work or let me compete fairly with this 'Mr. Alistair'!"

"Mr. Valence—"

"What's wrong with me?" Victor's pride was wounded. "In Houston, aside from my brother Julian and Adrian Roland, I'm the most eligible bachelor!"

Stella sighed. "My heart belongs to someone else."

"Who?"

"Mr. Alistair."

"Impossible!" he declared. "Unless he's Julian or Adrian himself, no man outshines me!"
###Chapter 147: Texting Romance, A Form of Online Dating

Stella Valentine held her phone, fingertips slightly chilled.

Victor Valence's voice still echoed in her ears: "What do you really want? Money or status?"

She shook her head gently, though he couldn't see it.

"Mr. Valence, we're not the same kind of people."

A scoff came through the phone. "Stop pretending to be noble. Manager Quentin said you're desperate for money."

"That was before."

"And now? For that so-called Mr. Alistair?" Victor's voice suddenly sharpened. "What kind of spell has he cast on you?"

Stella pressed her lips together.

Mr. Alistair's identity was a secret. She couldn't—and wouldn't—explain it to anyone.

"Mr. Valence, I hope you find the right person."

"Damn it!" The call ended with a violent click.

Stella stared at the darkened screen and exhaled deeply.

This spoiled heir would never understand that some things couldn't be measured by money.

Pushing open the hospital room door, laughter greeted her.

Ethan was animatedly gesturing about something, while Grace Laurent smiled, fine wrinkles forming at the corners of her eyes.

"Mommy!" The little boy rushed over like an excited bird.

Stella caught him, ruffling his soft hair.

Grace chuckled. "This child—he can't go a minute without clinging to you."

"Grandma," Ethan looked up, "because I love Mommy the most!"

Grace laughed heartily. "His personality is nothing like yours when you were little, Stella. You were so proud back then."

Stella's smile froze for a second.

She knew what her mother would say next.

Sure enough—

"He must take after his father."

The air in the room grew heavy.

Grace realized her mistake and quickly took her daughter's hand. "I didn't mean to—"

"It's fine." Stella forced a smile.

"Stella," Grace hesitated before continuing, "you're still young. You should think about your future..."

A dull ache pulsed at Stella's temples.

After dealing with Victor, now she had to face her mother's pressure about marriage.

"Mom, I know what I'm doing."

"Do you?" Grace grew anxious. "Do you really plan to spend your life alone?"

Ethan suddenly chimed in, "Grandma, Mommy has a new daddy!"

Grace's eyes widened. "What?"

Stella massaged her forehead.

This kid...

"It's true!" Ethan waved his arms excitedly. "New Daddy is a superhero! He comes to protect Mommy every night!"

Grace's expression shifted from shock to concern.

"Stella," she asked carefully, "are you... alright?"

Stella didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

"Mom, it's not what you think."

"Then what is it?" Grace frowned. "Is it... online dating?"

Stella opened her mouth but found no words.

Texting romance—technically, it counted as online dating.

Matchmade by the phone carrier.

"Grandma," Ethan said seriously, "New Daddy is amazing! Even cooler than Iron Man!"

Grace touched Stella's forehead. "No fever..."

Before Stella could explain, the door burst open.

"Aunt Grace!" Joy Fairsprene barged in, arms full of bags. "Look what I brought you!"

Ethan cheered and ran to her. "Godmother!"

Joy scooped him up. "Oh, my sweet boy!"

Grace smiled. "Joy, you should start thinking about settling down too..."

Joy's face fell. She grabbed Stella's arm and dragged her out. "Aunt Grace, we'll be right back!"

In the hallway, Joy clutched her chest. "Save me. Why are elders like this nowadays?"

Stella sighed. "Misery loves company."

"But," Joy leaned in, curiosity burning in her eyes, "what's this about Ethan's 'new daddy'?"

Stella gazed out the window.

Dusk deepened, city lights flickering to life.

"A... very special person," she said softly.
###Chapter 148: I'm Done with This Nonsense!

Stella dragged Joy through the hospital corridors until they reached the back garden, both gasping for breath.

"Your mom is seriously the sweetest," Joy panted, bracing her hands on her knees. "But her matchmaking energy rivals my dad's."

Stella gave her friend a grateful look. "Thanks for taking care of Mom, Joy."

"Please, she's like my dream mother," Joy waved it off. "Except for the constant attempts to set me up."

They settled on a bench, catching up. When Stella mentioned meeting Mr. Alistair, Joy's expression turned smug.

"Told you!" She wiggled her eyebrows triumphantly. "That man looks exactly like Adrian Roland. He stayed hidden because he knew you'd reject him. Now that the truth's out, you can call me Joy Sherlock."

"What about you and Julian—"

"Over!" Joy rolled her eyes dramatically. "I only got close to him to gather intel for you. Mission accomplished—this lady isn't putting up with his nonsense!"

Stella blinked. "What happened?"

"He made me fetch twenty coffees in one afternoon!" Joy stomped her foot. "And kept editing documents piecemeal just to mess with me!"

"Maybe he was—"

"Whatever!" Joy suddenly lowered her voice. "Oliver's situation got complicated."

"What's wrong?"

"All the paperwork was ready. Harry even agreed to a fake marriage to help." Joy sighed. "But Oliver refused the adoption. His autism symptoms might be worsening."

When Lily's pregnancy came up, Joy leaned in conspiratorially. "Stella, is Adrian unusually... you know..."

"Joy!"

"I'm just curious!" Joy grinned. "Lily was diagnosed infertile. This pregnancy makes zero scientific sense!"

Suddenly, Joy grabbed Stella's arm. "Look!"

Near the outpatient entrance, Sophia Durand and her daughter were heading toward the elevators.

"Let's follow them!" Joy tugged Stella excitedly. "I bet that pregnancy's fake!"

Inside the OB-GYN clinic on the fourth floor, Sophia slid a gold card across the desk.

"Doctor, this is yours if you can make my daughter test positive."

The physician shook her head. "Her body can't sustain a pregnancy."

"We don't need a live birth," Sophia smiled. "Just a positive test result."

"But—"

"As for the sperm source," Sophia whispered, "any donor will do."
###Chapter 149: I'll Worry

The doctor's face turned ashen. His fingers clenched the medical chart. "Are you insane? Playing with human lives?"

Lily Savigny scoffed. She pulled a wad of cash from her Chanel bag and slammed it on the desk. "Enough talk. Is this sufficient? I can add more."

"Get out!" The doctor slammed his fist on the table, his white coat trembling. "No amount of money will make me commit such an atrocity!"

The door slammed shut, cutting off Lily's shrill screams.

"Mom! Why did you stop me?" Lily stomped her Louboutin heels against the marble floor. "Who does that penniless doctor think he is?"

Sophia Durand leisurely reapplied her lipstick. "Patience. Houston has plenty of private clinics. Someone will take the job."

"But we're running out of time!" Lily clutched her silk skirt, her nails nearly piercing the fabric. "If Adrian realizes I'm not pregnant—"

Sophia snapped her compact shut. Her eyes turned icy. "Have you identified who leaked those photos?"

Lily froze. "It must be that bitch Stella! Who else would—"

"The Valois family." Sophia's voice was razor-sharp. "Victor mentioned Victor Valence from Valois Realty has been seen with Stella recently."

"Victor Valence?" Lily's pupils constricted. "The owner of Unique Jewelry?"

In the stairwell shadows, Stella Valentine clamped a hand over her mouth. Joy Fairsprene frantically gestured at her to silence the ringing phone.

"Stella?" Mr. Alistair's hoarse voice came through. "Where are you?"

She whispered, "At the hospital. Ran into Joy."

A weighted pause. When he spoke again, his voice trembled. "Don't wander off... I'll worry."

Stella watched Lily and Sophia disappear down the corridor. "They won't dare touch me now."

A sudden coughing fit erupted through the line, followed by clinking glass.

"You're sick?" Her chest tightened.

"It's nothing." His voice grew distant. "Stella, remember—no matter what happens—"

The call disconnected.

Stella stared at the darkened screen, her fingers numb. He'd never sounded so... off.

Joy grabbed her wrist. "Look!"

Through the railing gaps, they saw Lily and Sophia heading toward the VIP maternity wing. Sophia was on the phone, smirking.

"They're hunting for an underground clinic." Joy gritted her teeth. "Should we tell Adrian?"

Stella shook her head, eyes locked on her last unread text:

"8 PM. Rosewood Manor. Critical information."

Sender: Mr. Alistair.
###Chapter 150: I'll Confess Everything to Her Personally

"Mr. Alistair?"

Adrian Roland snapped back to attention. "I'm here."

Stella Valentine's voice carried a hint of amusement. "Why did you go quiet? Are you busy with work?"

"It's nothing," Adrian replied softly, his tone warm. "Stella, could you return to the hospital room soon? I worry when I can't see you."

She gave a gentle affirmation. "I'll head back now."

"Good girl."

The moment the call ended, Joy Fairsprene mimicked his tone with exaggerated sweetness. "'Good girl~' Ugh, that's so saccharine it's giving me cavities..."

Stella's ears turned pink. "He's just concerned about me."

Joy widened her eyes dramatically. "Wow, that's even more intense than Julian! He never keeps tabs on me like that."

Stella explained, "Mr. Alistair has always struggled with security. It's different from Julian."

Joy nodded thoughtfully. "True. Losing both parents young, living with autism spectrum disorder... You're probably the only light in his life."

At the mention of his past, Stella's heart clenched.

She'd never imagined the man who always protected her with such tenderness had endured such loneliness.

"By the way," Joy suddenly asked, "what's his real name? We can't keep calling him 'Mr. Alistair' forever."

Stella shook her head. "He dislikes discussing it. Didn't Julian tell you?"

"Ugh!" Joy smacked her thigh in frustration. "I should've asked before dumping him! Going back now would be so embarrassing!"

Stella chuckled. "It's fine. He's just Mr. Alistair. That's enough."

"Guess so." Joy's expression turned serious. "Stella, promise me you'll be happy this time."

"I will."

Joy sighed. "You and Adrian were so sweet back then. Who would've thought..."

Stella lowered her lashes. "Some things just aren't meant to be."

"But fate seems determined to make you a Roland!" Joy suddenly perked up with gossip. "You must've been shocked seeing Mr. Alistair for the first time! Facing someone who looks exactly like Adrian every day..."

"No," Stella said firmly. "Mr. Alistair is Mr. Alistair."

Joy tilted her head. "Surely they share some similarities?"

"Not that I've noticed." Stella changed the subject. "What about you and Julian—"

"Over!" Joy tossed her hair breezily. "He's busy with family drama now. No time for me."

"Victor Valence?"

Joy blinked. "How'd you know? Did he complain to you?"

Stella nodded. "Eleanor visited the company."

"Ha!" Joy crowed with glee. "He's worse off than me! His mom set him up on a blind date that chased him abroad, and he brushed her off. Now Eleanor's forcing him to apologize in person. He completely lost it."

Understanding dawned on Stella.

No wonder Victor had been so desperate to recruit her as a fake girlfriend.

"Honestly," Joy said seriously, "if not for Mr. Alistair, you and Victor would make a good match."

Stella shook her head. "I have Mr. Alistair."

"Which makes Victor's situation even sadder~" Joy laughed. "Can't even find a pretend marriage partner!"

They returned to the hospital room laughing.

The driver was anxiously on the phone. "Sir, Miss Valentine is back... She appears well... Understood..."

Spotting Stella, he hurried over. "Miss Valentine, I had to retrieve the gifts Mr. Alistair prepared and couldn't accompany you—"

"Not your fault," Stella said gently. "I wanted to take a walk with Joy."

The driver hesitated. "He was very worried."

"I know."

Stella pulled out her phone: [Don't blame the driver. I wanted to stroll with Joy.]

Mr. Alistair replied instantly: [I'm not. Prepared gifts for your mother. Sorry I can't visit in person.]

[It's fine.]

[Wait a little longer. We'll go abroad soon. If your mother wishes, she can join us.]

[Okay.]

[Explain to her for me. When the time comes, I'll confess everything to her personally.]

Putting away her phone, she pushed open the hospital room door.

"Mommy!" Ethan Valentine flew into her arms like a sparrow. "Daddy sent so many presents for Grandma!"

Grace Laurent stared at the lavish gifts filling the room. "Stella... this person you mentioned... He's real?"

"Of course." Stella smiled.

"Is he... young?" Grace asked uncertainly.

Stella suppressed a laugh. "Thirty. That still counts as young, right?"
###Chapter 151: If You Love Her So Much, Where Were You Before?

Twenty-nine years and seven months.

Stella Valentine silently calculated Mr. Alistair's age. He and Adrian Roland were twins, sharing the same birthday. At least she didn't have to memorize another date.

Though it didn't seem entirely fair to him.

"Auntie, don't worry," Joy Fairsprene chimed in with a playful wink. "Stella's new boyfriend treats her like a queen. I'm practically green with envy."

Grace Laurent chuckled. "Don't you have a doting boyfriend of your own? Why envy Stella?"

Joy's eyes widened. "How did you know? Did Stella tell you?"

Grace pointed at Joy's collar.

Looking down, Joy saw her white V-neck sweater had slipped, revealing a reddish mark near her collarbone. She hastily covered it. "Mosquito bite!"

"Skip the concealer," Grace advised gently. "Wear something breathable. That sweater looks stuffy."

Joy mumbled, cheeks flushed, "I'll get him back later..."

Ethan Valentine peered curiously. "Godmother, why do mosquitoes only bite there?"

"Because it was a super evil mosquito!"

"I'll ask Daddy to swat it for you!"

Joy pinched Ethan's cheeks affectionately. "Stella, if marriage produced kids this adorable, I might actually consider it."

Laughter filled the hospital room. Grace watched the two contrasting personalities play with Ethan, time flying by.

"Time to go," she reminded them. "Someone's waiting outside. Stella, remember your father's words—good intentions make good people."

Stella nodded. "I will."

"Visit your father and grandparents... with the children when you can."

"I'll find time."

Outside, their driver approached immediately. "Miss Valentine, heading back?"

"Yes, sorry for the wait."

He beamed. "Your happiness makes any wait worthwhile."

Joy shot him a knowing look. "Careful, young man. Dangerous thoughts."

The driver turned crimson. "I'm just glad for Mr. Alistair. Hearing about Miss Valentine's wellbeing is his only joy these years."

"That's more like it..." Joy smirked.

In the car, Joy suddenly produced two tickets. "Almost forgot."

Front-row seats to Harry Vance's concert.

"Impossible to get," Joy bragged. "Take your mysterious Mr. Alistair for some romance."

Stella accepted them. "I actually made a childhood wish list..."

"What list?"

"Just naive dreams. But later..." She shook her head with a bitter smile.

"You're only twenty-six!" Joy encouraged. "Plenty of time to make them come true!"

......

Lily Savigny flipped through a notebook retrieved from Stella's old belongings, sneering as she read aloud:

"See snow in Houston? Winter temperatures hit fifty-nine degrees here. Keep dreaming."

The fingerprint lock beeped.

Adrian entered, bringing a chill with him. "What else do you want?"

"Must you be so cold?" Lily stroked her belly irritably. "Remember, Stella still needs my lung."

"Name your price. Money, property, shares, or the company?"

"Even your company?"

"I'd give my life if it meant you'd donate that lung."

She laughed lightly. "Love her that much?"

"State your terms."

"I want you here every night until this baby's born."

"Impossible."

Her smile vanished. "If you loved her so much, where were you before?"

Adrian's gaze turned glacial. "Without your manufactured misunderstandings, none of this would've happened. To me, you're just a lung container now."

"But you hurt her most," Lily taunted. "She's with Victor Valence now, while you—"

"Victor? Who told you that?"

"Was it hard to guess?" She smirked triumphantly. "Oh, and you still don't know who her precious 'Mr. Alistair' is, do you? Stay tonight, and I'll tell you."
###Chapter 152: Obsession in the Flames

The lighter's flame danced on Lily Savigny's fingertips.

Adrian Roland's pupils constricted sharply.

"Burn it, and you'll never read her words to you again." Lily's voice dripped with malicious delight.

The edges of the brown notebook had already begun to curl.

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. He recognized this notebook—a birthday gift he'd personally chosen six years ago. The leather cover had faded with time.

"What do you want?"

Lily tilted her head, the firelight flickering across her face. "I want you to marry me."

A sudden gust of wind blew through the window, causing the flames to leap higher. Lily shrieked as the notebook slipped from her grasp.

Adrian lunged for the window.

Without hesitation, he jumped from the second floor.

"Adrian!" Lily's scream pierced the night.

When security arrived, they found Adrian kneeling on the lawn. His suit was smeared with dirt, blood trickling from his temple, yet he cradled the charred notebook protectively against his chest.

"Mr. Roland, should we call an ambulance?"

Adrian shook his head, his hands trembling as he pulled out his phone. The moment the screen lit up, his tense expression softened.

["What time will you be home tonight? I made Mapo Tofu!"]

The security guard watched as the business tycoon's lips curved into a faint smile.

"Please reply for me," Adrian rasped. "I'll be there in fifteen minutes."

By the time Lily rushed outside, Adrian's taillights had already disappeared around the corner. Two guards blocked her path.

"There's only ever been one mistress of this villa." Their gazes were wary. "It's been empty since Ms. Stella left."

Lily's face drained of color.

Meanwhile, inside the car, Adrian carefully opened the scorched notebook. Amid the blackened pages, a line of childish handwriting remained barely legible:

["Birthday wish at twenty: Marry Adrian."]

His fingers gently traced the words as though touching the most precious treasure.
###Chapter 153: Something Precious

"You have no right to arrest me! I'm not a thief!"

Lily Savigny shrieked hysterically, her pajama collar askew from struggling, revealing too much skin.

The security captain took a step back with a frown. "Ma'am, please cooperate with the investigation."

"I'm Adrian Roland's future wife!" She waved her phone wildly. "Dare to lay a finger on me!"

A rookie guard's eyes widened. "Captain, I recognize her! She's the one from last month's financial scandal—"

"Shut up!" Lily snapped.

The guards exchanged glances and retreated in unison.

"Let it go. The Roland family's drama isn't our business."

"Tsk, Mrs. Roland is such a kind woman..."

The whispers reached Lily's ears. Her fists clenched, nails digging into her palms.

Meanwhile, the aroma of spicy cuisine wafted from the kitchen of Rose Garden.

"Mom, when will Daddy be home?" Ethan glanced at the clock for the umpteenth time.

Stella Valentine placed the final dish of boiled fish on the table. "Let's wait a little longer."

The boy suddenly jumped off his chair and ran to the balcony. "Mom, look! Headlights!"

In the darkness, a pair of headlights cut through the night.

"It's Daddy's car!" Ethan cheered.

Stella watched the approaching light, her lips curving unconsciously.

By the time the doorbell rang, Ethan had already bolted like a cannonball.

"Daddy!"

Mr. Alistair caught the child with one arm, swaying imperceptibly.

"Missed me?"

"Super much!" Ethan clung to his neck. "We visited Grandma today!"

Stella approached, immediately noticing her husband had switched arms to hold their son.

"Are you hurt?" she asked softly.

He shook his head, producing a pet carrier from behind. "A gift for you."

Inside, a snow-white Samoyed puppy tilted its head at them.

"Oh my!" Stella knelt in delight. The moment her fingers touched the cage, the puppy licked them eagerly.

Ethan dashed around gathering materials for a dog bed, eventually sacrificing his favorite dinosaur pajamas.

"It's so soft..." The boy stroked the puppy gently, eyes shining like stars.

Watching them, Stella's eyes grew moist. "I've always wanted a dog."

"I know." His voice was tender behind her.

She looked up. "How?"

"Lucky guess." He chuckled. "Now we can raise it together."

Ethan suddenly lifted his head. "Daddy, you're really my real dad, right?"

The air froze.

Stella saw her husband's Adam's apple bob before he simply ruffled the boy's hair. "Go get water for the puppy."

Late at night, Stella stood on the balcony, gazing at the stars.

A coat draped over her shoulders.

"What's on your mind?"

"Just thinking... how strange fate is." She turned to him. "Thank you for the gift."

Moonlight revealed turbulent emotions in his eyes. "Stella, there's something—"

"Hmm?"

He simply pulled her into an embrace. "Never mind. We'll always be together from now on."

In the living room, the puppy sighed contentedly. Ethan's steady breathing drifted from his bedroom.

This moment of peace was more precious than any treasure.
###Chapter 154: Just Be Yourself

The snow-white Samoyed puppy circled cheerfully around the living room, drawing laughter from the family of three. Martha emerged from the kitchen with the final dish, smiling warmly. "Mr. Alistair, Miss Stella, dinner's getting cold. Please eat while it's hot."

Adrian gave a slight nod and pulled out a chair for Stella with gentlemanly grace. He waited until she was seated before taking his place beside her. Martha settled Ethan into his booster seat while the puppy obediently curled up at the little boy's feet.

"Be good," Ethan cooed in an imitation of adult tones, gently stroking the puppy's head. "I'll play with you after dinner."

The table was laden with home-cooked dishes bursting with color and aroma. Alongside Stella's favorite mapo tofu were stir-fried beef with peppers and shredded pork with green peppers, accompanied by a tangy tripe soup to whet the appetite.

Ethan's eyes lit up as he eagerly grabbed his spoon. Having grown up in the States, authentic home-style cooking still amazed him. Every dish Martha prepared earned his enthusiastic praise, making the elderly woman beam with delight.

"Mom's cooking is just as good as Martha's!" The little boy mumbled around a full mouth, giving a thumbs-up.

Stella's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Eat as much as you like."

"No, no." Ethan shook his head vigorously. "Dad fought monsters all day. He needs it more."

With a chuckle, Stella placed the last piece of tofu into her son's bowl before turning to Adrian, who had barely touched his food. "Not to your taste?"

The man immediately shook his head and began eating heartily alongside Ethan. But the beads of sweat forming on his forehead betrayed him.

"Don't force yourself." Stella reached for a napkin to dab his brow. "Neither of you handle spice well. I'll make milder dishes next—"

A warm hand covered hers, gently guiding her back into her seat. "I love seeing how happy spicy food makes you." His eyes softened. "Just be yourself. Don't change for anyone. I'll...adjust to the heat gradually."

Stella's heart fluttered, then she noticed something odd near his temple. "You're hurt?"

Adrian shot to his feet, fingers hastily combing through his bangs. "Paint from the construction site."

"But there's blood on the napkin—"

"Stella." He cut her off as his phone rang. "I need to take this."

He fled like a man pursued—not even waiting for the elevator, taking the emergency stairs two at a time.

In the shadowed garden, Charlie stood waiting. Adrian barely made it to the corner before doubling over, retching violently, his face ghostly pale.

"Mr. Roland!" Charlie thrust forward a water bottle. "Why do this to yourself?"

Water soothed his burning throat as Adrian leaned against the wall, panting. "Can't...let her find out."

"Even if you can't eat spicy food, Miss Stella would never suspect—"

"No risks." Bloodshot eyes lifted. "She said she'd accept anyone...except Adrian Roland."

Charlie wrung his hands. "How long can you keep this up? The wound, your tastes, your habits—"

"Just until we deal with Victor and reclaim the Shi family." Adrian wiped his mouth. "Then we'll start fresh overseas."

"What about the company? Mr. Xavier—"

"Return what's his." Adrian's voice was calm. "That million dollars? I'll repay it a hundredfold."

Charlie stomped his foot. "He wants you as his successor!"

Adrian gave a hollow laugh. "What's the point?" The night breeze ruffled his exhausted features. "After facing death, I know what truly matters."

"But Mr. Xavier won't just—"

"I'll handle it." Adrian winced suddenly. "Got any bandages?"

Charlie produced a first-aid kit, then gasped upon brushing aside Adrian's damp hair. "This needs stitches!"

"Fell from the second floor. Not fatal."

"It'll scar!" Desperation sparked an idea. "Miss Stella will notice eventually!"

That finally broke through. Blood had already soaked through three gauze pads, trickling down his neck.

His phone screen lit up as Adrian typed with difficulty: [Stella, don't wait up. Handling some business.]

In the bedroom, Stella had just tucked in the children. Ethan slept soundly with the puppy curled beside him, while baby Luna smacked her lips in the crib.

Alone in the cavernous master bedroom, Stella suddenly found the space unbearably vast. Her fingers absently traced the phone screen, rereading that brief message.

Outside, the silent blue flash of an ambulance streaked across the night sky.
###Chapter 155: Divorce It Is, I'll Be With You

Mr. Alistair returned sooner than expected.

Stella Valentine was curled up in bed, texting Joy Fairsprene about Julian Valois's latest outrageous antics. Suddenly, a pair of arms wrapped around her from behind.

The bedroom was dark, lit only by moonlight filtering through the sheer curtains. His familiar cologne carried a faint trace of tobacco.

"You're back?"

"Mmm." His voice was rougher than usual. "Had to handle something urgent."

Stella turned in his embrace. The scent of cigarettes grew stronger, making her sneeze.

"You smoked again?"

"Stood outside for half an hour to air out." Exhaustion laced his words. "Wanted to see you."

She touched his cheek. "Smoking less would be better for you."

"I know." His palm pressed over her heart. "Does it... still hurt?"

Stella shook her head. The past days had been so peaceful, she'd almost forgotten she was still ill.

"My divorce from Adrian Roland will be finalized this Friday," she murmured.

After a pause, he pulled her closer. "Then let it be. I'll stay with you."

......

The shrill ringtone shattered the morning quiet.

"Miss Valentine, a Mr. Valence claiming to be your supervisor is here to visit your mother," the nurse said hesitantly. "After last time, we didn't dare let him in without—"

Stella was instantly alert. "Victor Valence?"

She immediately called him. His lazy drawl answered, "Miss me that much?"

"What are you playing at?"

"Just showing corporate concern for an employee's family." His chuckle grated. "Come over. We'll talk."

Hanging up, Victor flashed his phone at the nurse. "Convinced?" Without waiting, he strode into the hospital room with gifts in hand.

Grace Laurent startled at the sudden intrusion.

"Good morning, Mrs. Laurent." Victor set down the packages, straightening his collar. "I'm Stella's boss. Also... her admirer."

Grace's eyes brightened. "You're the one my little star mentioned yesterday?"

Victor's brows rose in delight. "She talked about me?"

"That girl's too shy for details." Grace warmly gestured for him to sit. "How old are you, young man?"

"Twenty-nine. Three years older than Stella."

Grace studied him approvingly. "Our Stella has two children—"

"I know." His smile never wavered. "It doesn't matter to me."

The door burst open. Stella stood panting in the doorway, glaring at Victor. "Mr. Valence!"

He rose smoothly. "Perfect timing. Your mother and I were just discussing you."

Stella looked at Grace's approving expression and felt her scalp prickle. "What did you tell him?"

"Mr. Valence seems lovely." Grace patted her daughter's hand. "Be polite to your superiors."

Victor smirked. "She's usually quite fierce—hangs up on me constantly."

Stella couldn't take another second. "Sir, shouldn't you be at the office? Let me walk you out."

At the hospital entrance, she finally snapped. "What's your game?"

Victor's lips curved. "Isn't it obvious? I'm courting you."
###Chapter 156 I Can't Be as Carefree as You

Victor Valence abruptly withdrew his arm, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Your mother mentioned you brought me up."

Stella Valentine froze. "Impossible. She doesn't even know I worked at Unique Jewelry."

"Liar." Victor leaned in, his breath hot against her face. "She said it herself."

"Mr. Valence, I repeat—I didn't."

Victor suddenly smirked. "Stella, I've figured it out. Aside from being stubborn, narrow-minded, overthinking everything, and prone to wild assumptions—you're actually decent marriage material."

Stella arched a brow. "That's quite the list of exceptions."

"So what? I don't mind." Victor shoved his hands in his pockets. "The matches my mother arranges irritate me. But you..."

He paused, eyes burning. "Suddenly marriage doesn't seem so terrifying."

Stella stepped back. "I told you I have a—"

"Your 'Mr. Alistair'?" Victor scoffed. "I checked. In Houston, only my brother and Adrian Roland outrank me. So either you're lying, or..."

His gaze turned pointed. "You're having a mental breakdown."

Stella clenched her fists. "The world has many capable men."

"Please. I know every influential figure in Houston." Victor advanced. "Unless... Adrian wore a disguise to trick you."

Stella's heart skipped.

A disguise...

Mr. Alistair did resemble Adrian, but...

"It's not him," she stated firmly.

Victor's tone unexpectedly softened. "Whether this 'Mr. Alistair' is real or not, remember—you have me as backup."

"Why me?"

"Who knows?" Victor shrugged. "Like how my brother is obsessed with Joy Fairsprene. Once you've met the best, everyone else is a compromise."

Her phone vibrated.

[Tell Victor I'll prove my existence to him.]

Stella turned the screen toward Victor.

"A text?" He laughed mockingly. "Stella, are you actually unhinged? Who texts these days?"

"None of your business."

"My father's birthday is Friday." Victor abruptly changed topics. "You're coming."

"I'm busy."

Victor lowered his voice. "About that car accident six years ago... I found the dashcam footage."

Stella's pupils constricted.

Victor gave her a long look before walking away.

In the hospital room, Grace Laurent looked hopeful. "Was that young man the Valence heir?"

"Mom, we're not involved."

"But last time you mentioned—"

Stella hesitated. She didn't even know Mr. Alistair's real name.

"When the time's right, I'll introduce him."

Outside, a white Porsche blocked her path.

Adrian Roland stepped out. "Get in. We're discussing the divorce."

Dark circles shadowed his exhausted eyes.

The car remained silent for minutes.

"You keep the villa. Plus two million in child support."

"I don't want money."

"It's for the kids." Adrian gripped the wheel. "I want monthly visits."

After a pause, Stella nodded.

"And..." Adrian hesitated. "Never mind."

"What is it?"

Adrian smiled bitterly. "I can't be as carefree as you."

"When your heart dies, carefreeness comes naturally."

Stella pointed ahead. "Drop me here. My boyfriend... wouldn't like it."
###Chapter 157: Without Him, I Wouldn't Be Alive

"You care deeply about that man."

Adrian Roland's voice echoed through the car—not a question, but a statement.

Stella Valentine remained silent, gazing at the blur of city lights outside the window.

As the car stopped at a red light, she pushed the door open without hesitation and walked away.

The engine didn't start behind her, but she refused to look back.

Let it all end here. Every reopened wound from the past felt like slow torture. She wouldn't shed another tear for lost youth.

"Watch out!"

A dark figure slammed into her shoulder, yanking her purse away with brutal force.

White-hot pain exploded through her abdomen. She staggered, doubling over.

"Stella!" Adrian sprinted to her side, steadying her trembling frame. "Where does it hurt?"

The thief had struck precisely where her unhealed wound lay.

Pain drowned her senses. She bit her lip, unable to speak.

"My bag..."

"Forget the bag. I'm taking you to the hospital."

"No..." She gasped. "There's something inside—"

"What could be more important than your life?"

The tie—Mr. Alistair's gift—rested quietly in her wallet's hidden compartment.

Adrian lifted her into his arms. He hesitated at the passenger seat, then laid her across the back to avoid seatbelt pressure on her injury.

"Not Houston General," she whispered. "Don't let my mother worry."

"...Understood."

When the pain dulled slightly, her first instinct was to contact Mr. Alistair.

But her phone had been stolen along with her purse.

"Adrian..."

"I'm here." His eyes met hers in the rearview mirror.

"Let me borrow your phone."

"Who are you calling? I'll dial for you."

"My boyfriend." She clenched her jaw. "Just hand me the phone."

His grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Can't while driving."

"Weren't we done with this separation?"

"Divorce is one thing. Using my phone to call my rival is another."

She scoffed, leaning back. "Forget it then."

"Changed your mind?"

"How could I call without a phone?" She closed her eyes. "He always knows where I am anyway."

"Then why contact him?"

"Just..." Her voice faded. "I've grown used to having someone to lean on."

Adrian inhaled sharply. "Will you...marry him?"

"Maybe." Her fingers brushed her abdomen. "With my health, I might not—"

"Don't." His voice cracked.

"What?"

"Marriage is complicated."

A mocking smile touched her lips. "Lily Savigny has high standards? The great Adrian Roland has limits?"

"I don't want to."

"...What?"

"I said, I don't want to marry her." His words came out rough. "Believe me?"

"Not my concern."

"Stella, is there really...no chance for us?"

"None."

"What if..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "What if that man had never appeared?"

She watched clouds streak past the window. "Without him, I'd already be dead."

Silence swallowed the car.

"If you're certain he's the one..." His voice turned hoarse. "I'll disappear forever."

After a long pause, she whispered, "That would be best."

......

"The impact didn't cause new damage. You're healing well."

The doctor set down the X-ray and offered another form. "Ms. Valentine, you've had a lung resection?"

"Yes. Cancer."

"We should check for possible metastasis." Noticing her pallor, he softened his tone. "Don't worry. Your color looks good—likely nothing."

She stared at the form, unable to lift her hand.

Terrified that test results might shatter her fragile happiness.

Adrian finally took the paper and guided her out.

"I don't want the scan." She shook her head. "The children are waiting."

"Your choice." He pressed the form into her palm.

No test means no knowledge.
No knowledge means pretending everything's fine.

Call her cowardly or self-deceiving—she only wanted to protect this stolen peace.

At the hospital entrance, she hailed a cab. "Rosewood Gardens, please."

"Got it."

"Sir, may I borrow your phone?" She explained, "My purse was stolen. I'll double your fare when we arrive."

The driver eyed her suspiciously but handed over his phone.

Her fingers moved automatically, dialing the memorized number.

Ring—Ring—

No answer.

This wasn't right. Mr. Alistair never missed her calls.

"Miss, you're not trying to skip payment, are you?"

"One more try." Her hands trembled.

Still no response.

"Call someone else?" The driver sounded impatient.

After a pause, she dialed Joy Fairsprene's number.

"Hello?" A sleep-roughened male voice answered.

Confirming the number, she hesitated. "Is this...Joy's phone?"

The man yawned. "Ms. Valentine?"

That voice...

"Victor Valence?"
###Chapter 158: Identity Enigma

"Who's calling this early..." Joy Fairsprene's groggy voice mumbled through the phone. "Take your calls outside. Don't disturb my beauty sleep!"

Stella Valentine glanced out the window where the sunset painted the sky in shades of tangerine.

"Apologies, Miss Valentine. One moment."

"Alright."

The rustle of fabric was followed by the sound of a sliding door opening and closing.

"Miss Valentine?"

"I'm here."

Julian Valois's voice finally cleared. "Joy was... up very late last night. I wanted her to rest. What do you need?"

Understanding dawned on Stella.

"You and Joy... got back together?"

Julian chuckled. "As long as you're still entangled with Mr. Alistair, she'll keep coming to me for updates. In a way, I should thank you."

"But Joy doesn't want marriage. Your family—"

"If she doesn't want to marry, we won't. If she doesn't want children, we won't." His tone was light. "The Valois family still has Victor. We're not lacking heirs."

"..."

"By the way, what did you need from Joy?"

Stella hesitated. "My bag was stolen. I needed to borrow money for the cab fare."

"Should I transfer it via WeChat?"

"My phone was in the bag."

Julian paused. "Cash, then? What about Mr. Alistair? Can't reach him?"

"No one's answering. Maybe because it's an unknown number..."

"Strange. That number should only have your contact..." He changed the subject. "Don't worry. I'll come now. Rose Garden Apartments, right? Fifteen minutes."

"Thank you."

"Don't mention it."

After hanging up, Stella dialed Mr. Alistair's number again. Still no answer.

She returned the phone to the driver. "Someone will come to pay."

The driver nodded. "Good."

Twenty minutes later, the cab pulled up to Rose Garden.

Julian was already waiting. He handed the driver a hundred-dollar bill. "Keep the change."

The driver drove off cheerfully.

"Does it still hurt?" Julian reached out to steady her.

Stella tensed. "How did you know I was hurt?"

"Weren't you knocked over during the robbery?"

"Yes, but..." She bit her lip. "Did Mr. Alistair tell you?"

Julian stiffened. "Well..."

"You reached him? He knows I'm hurt? Why isn't he answering my calls?"

Julian gritted his teeth. "He didn't recognize the unknown number. He tried calling you back, but your phone was gone. He's on his way now."

"Really?"

"Of course." His voice was firm. "That number only saves your contact. All other calls go unanswered. Feeling better now?"

Stella nodded slightly. "Much better. You and Joy..."

A softness flickered in Julian's eyes. "I'll always be her final harbor."

Stella didn't doubt his sincerity. Given his status, waiting this long for Joy was rare.

But would the Valois family accept her stance on marriage? Remembering Eleanor Valois pressuring Victor about weddings, she worried for the couple.

"Let's get you upstairs." Julian pressed the elevator button. "Mr. Alistair insisted on seeing you home safely."

"You're... close?"

"Yes."

"How did you meet?"

Julian evaded. "Our families have been friends for generations."

"But he left the Roland family years ago."

"...Fate, I suppose." He smoothly changed the subject. "Here we are."

After watching Stella enter her apartment, Julian nearly sprinted away, bypassing the elevator for the stairs.

He dialed the moment he got into his car. "Where are you?"

"Drive forward a hundred meters. Under the trees. Tested—no line of sight from the apartment windows."

Julian started the engine, muttering, "Your relationship is like a spy thriller..."

A hundred meters away, Adrian Roland leaned against his car, smoke curling from his lips. The ashtray on the nearby trash bin overflowed with cigarette butts.

Julian frowned as he approached. "You ignored her call just to smoke?"

"I had to adjust my voice."

"Right. She thinks you're Mr. Alistair now. Can't risk sounding the same."

"How is she?"

"A little down, but fine. I watched her go inside."

Adrian nodded. "Thanks."

"Decision made?"

"Yes." He stubbed out the cigarette. "Let 'Adrian Roland' disappear. It cuts ties with Lily Savigny and makes Uncle Xavier back off."

"Living as Mr. Alistair from now on? Abandoning New Frontier Group?"

"Getting her back is miracle enough." Adrian gazed into the distance. "New Frontier goes to Uncle Xavier. Once this is settled, we'll take the children abroad."

Julian sighed. "Your love story is..." He hesitated. "But passports and visas—your brother is already... Can it be done?"

Adrian's eyes darkened. "There's always a way." He pulled a small leather notebook from his breast pocket, fingertips brushing the cover. "Art majors and their impossible wishlists."

"Mr. Alistair?"

A woman's voice froze them both.

Julian whirled around. Stella stood a few paces away, having somehow left her apartment unnoticed.

Her gaze locked onto the figure behind Julian. "Are you Mr. Alistair... or Adrian Roland?"
###Chapter 159: Never Leaving You

Stella Valentine's heartbeat quickened as she gazed at the man before her.

The slight furrow of his brows, the way he spoke—everything mirrored Mr. Alistair perfectly. Yet the impeccably tailored suit was unmistakably Adrian Roland’s, the same one she had seen him wear earlier that day.

Julian Valois, ever the seasoned businessman, recovered swiftly from his initial surprise. A knowing smile played on his lips as he turned to Mr. Alistair. "Shall I explain, or would you prefer to do it yourself?"

Adrian swiftly tucked the notebook back into his inner pocket, exchanging a silent glance with Julian.

"Thanks. I’ll transfer the cost later."

Julian chuckled. "It’s a limited edition. That’ll cost extra."

"Double, then."

With a polite nod toward Stella, Julian said, "Miss Valentine, I’ll take my leave now."

Only when Julian’s car disappeared from view did Adrian finally look away.

"...Mr. Alistair?"

"Hmm." The corner of his lips lifted as he stepped closer. "Even you couldn’t tell us apart?"

Stella shook her head. "I’d recognize your voice anywhere. But… why did you ask Mr. Valois to prepare this suit?"

"For you."

"Me?"

"We’ll talk at home." He guided her into the car with a hand at her waist, carefully fastening her seatbelt before taking the driver’s seat.

The car glided smoothly toward Rose Garden.

"Stella, I promised to help you seek justice." His voice was low and resolute as he kept his eyes on the road. "Whatever you plan to do."

She studied his profile—the broad shoulders, sharp gaze, and steady tone. This was the Mr. Alistair she knew, a stark contrast to the Adrian she had encountered that morning.

Her tense nerves gradually eased. "I will make them pay for what they did to my father. Lily Savigny, Sophia Durand, Victor Lefèvre—none of them will escape. Once the divorce is finalized, I’ll use my father’s shares to join the board."

"Just like that? No divorce settlement?"

"What do you mean?"

"New Frontier Group is worth billions. As marital assets, you’re entitled to half."

"I don’t want it." Her voice was firm. "I want nothing more to do with him."

"But I’ll give it to you."

"You?"

"That’s why I borrowed this suit."

Stella inhaled sharply. "You… impersonated Adrian?"

"The Rolands owe me." His tone turned icy. "Half of it was always mine. Now, I’m giving it to you."

She stared at him, stunned into silence.

"So when Mr. Valois said you were busy today…"

"Something like that."

"But I truly don’t need it." She bit her lip. "Mr. Alistair, after the divorce on Friday, I just want justice for my father. Then… to live peacefully with you and the children."

Adrian’s throat moved as his voice softened. "I know."

"I saw Adrian today."

"At the hospital?"

"Yes, when I visited Grace." Her gaze drifted to the window. "We confirmed the paperwork for Friday."

"He must regret it."

"Maybe."

"And he’ll try to win you back."

Stella gave a bitter smile. "What’s the point? The damage is done. My father is gone, my lungs are… And Lily is carrying his child. Isn’t this what he wanted?"

"He didn’t know the truth back then. Hatred blinded him."

"I don’t blame him for helping Lily." Her voice trembled. "What hurts is that he never believed me. Not once in five years."

Silence filled the car.

Adrian rubbed his temples and pulled into the garage.

"Tired?" Guilt tinged her voice. "Let’s not talk about this anymore. I’ll cook dinner."

He smiled wryly, leaning in to brush his lips against hers. "Let Martha handle it."

"Is my cooking that bad?"

"It’s delicious. But I’m afraid."

"Afraid of what?"

"Of getting used to it." His fingertips traced her lips. "Happiness becomes a habit, and then you take it for granted. When it’s gone… the pain is unbearable."

She understood his fear. Even now, with everything they had, Mr. Alistair remained that same boy terrified of loss.

Wrapping her arms around his neck, she kissed him.

The contact sent a jolt through him.

"Stella…"

"Last time, you said you wanted me to kiss you first." Her eyes sparkled. "Still afraid?"

Her gaze reminded him of that night in Milan six years ago, when she had looked at him the same way, her eyes full of starlight.

Memories surged like a tidal wave, sending sharp pain through his skull.

"Mr. Alistair?" Worried, she pressed a hand to his forehead. "Are you unwell?"

He caught her fingers. "I’m fine."

"But you’re pale."

"Haven’t been sleeping well."

Stella suddenly remembered. "Joy mentioned you always came at night and left before dawn. That period… was hard, wasn’t it?"

"Hard." He admitted. "But happy."

Kissing her again, his voice shook. "Stella, you promised not to leave me."

She held him gently, stroking his back. "I won’t leave you."

"No matter what happens, no matter who I am—you’ll stay, right?"
###Chapter 160 Divorce Papers

The phone's vibration cut through the silence of the room like a knife.

Adrian Roland stared at the caller ID, his knuckles turning white.

He never got her answer in the end.

No matter. Once he wrapped things up here and moved abroad, everything would start anew.

"Hello?"

"Boss! We've located the vehicle involved in the hit-and-run six years ago!"

Adrian's pupils constricted. "I'm on my way."

He ended the call.

"Business?"

"Yeah." He grabbed his coat. "Let me take you home first."

Stella Valentine nodded obediently, a flicker of disappointment in her eyes.

After watching her enter the house, Adrian sped toward the scrapyard on the outskirts of town.

Jason Macmillan had been waiting in the overgrown lot for some time.

"Boss, it's over there."

Two mangled Land Rovers sat in the corner, their rusted bodies covered in moss.

"The 4S shop team will arrive shortly."

Adrian studied the wreckage, his expression unreadable.

"You didn't find them yourself?"

Jason hesitated. "Mr. Xavier Atlante sent word."

"What else did he say?"

"That... he hopes you'll remember who helped you."

Adrian let out a cold laugh.

"Boss, Mr. Atlante won't let this go easily." Jason lowered his voice. "He told me to warn you—he'll eliminate any distractions."

Adrian's knuckles cracked under the pressure.

"I understand."

Forty minutes later, the forensic team arrived.

"Mr. Roland, the vehicles are severely damaged. We'll need at least a week."

"Make it quick."

......

Friday came in the blink of an eye.

Ethan Valentine spun circles in the living room, his new Iron Man backpack bouncing with each turn.

"Mommy!" He rushed to hug Stella's legs the moment she appeared.

"Excited?"

"Yeah!" Ethan beamed up at her. "I told Marshmallow to protect you!"

Stella glanced at the Samoyed puppy sprawled asleep in its bed and stifled a laugh.

"Isn't Daddy taking me to school?"

"Daddy's been very busy lately."

Ethan nodded knowingly. "I get it. He's saving the world!"

The school stood just across the neighborhood.

The homeroom teacher greeted them warmly. "Don't worry, Mrs. Valentine. Mr. Roland has already given us detailed instructions."

Stella knelt to adjust her son's collar. "Mommy will pick you up this afternoon."

"Are you doing something important?"

"Yes. It won't take long."

She looked back three times after leaving the school gates.

A taxi pulled up to the curb.

"Miss, the Civil Affairs Bureau is packed today!" The driver chuckled. "Everyone's rushing to register their marriages before Mid-Autumn Festival."

Stella tightened her grip on the document folder in her bag.

"I'm here to file for divorce."
###Chapter 161: I Beg You

"Going to the civil affairs bureau on Mid-Autumn Festival?" The driver shot her a puzzled look through the rearview mirror.

Stella Valentine's fingers stilled for a moment. "Yes."

She checked the documents in her bag—marriage certificate, ID card, household register—everything was there.

Her phone screen lit up.

[On your way?]

Mr. Alistair's messages always came at the perfect time.

This new phone was specially chosen by him—simple, elegant, and just the right size for her palm.

[Almost at the civil affairs bureau.]

[Be safe.]

[Don't worry. He won’t do anything to me.]

A white Porsche screeched to a halt in front of the bureau, leaving ugly skid marks on the pavement.

When Adrian Roland stepped out, the right front bumper already bore a deep scratch.

"You're here," he said with a bitter smile.

Stella walked straight toward the entrance. "It’s not crowded today. Let’s get this over with quickly."

The lobby buzzed with noise and laughter.

"Marriage registration has a long line today," a cheerful guide informed them. "The divorce window is over there."

The corner window stood empty and quiet.

"Has the cooling-off period ended? Thirty days?"

"Today’s the last day," Stella replied calmly.

At the marriage registration counter, couples chatted excitedly in line.

"I want two babies!" a girl cooed.

Her boyfriend quickly agreed. "Whatever you say. Can we sign now?"

"What if you change after we’re married? Divorce is so hard these days."

"Look over there—" The boy pointed toward the divorce window, accidentally meeting Stella’s gaze. He immediately fell silent, embarrassed.

She looked away, her knuckles turning white from gripping her bag too tightly.

"We made promises like that too," Adrian said hoarsely. "Ethan and Luna..."

"None of that matters now," she cut him off.

The clerk adjusted his glasses. "The wife is forfeiting all assets? And full custody of both children?"

"Yes."

The official seal came down with a dull thud.

"Congratulations on your single status," the clerk said, handing over the divorce certificate.

Stella turned to leave but froze when a phone rang.

Adrian’s face paled. "Benjamin? Now? She might... Okay, I’ll try."

He grabbed her wrist. "Grandfather had a heart attack. He wants to see you—one last time."

She yanked her arm free. "We’re done."

"Please." His eyes were red. "Do it for him. Repay the kindness he showed you."

The Roland mansion still looked grand, but decay lingered beneath the opulence.

Benjamin wrung his hands at the entrance. "He just stabilized. Don’t say anything upsetting!"

"What happened?" Adrian quickened his pace.

"It’s all Lily’s fault!" Benjamin groaned. "She insisted on visiting today, saying it was a day for family reunions... The moment he heard, he collapsed!"
###Chapter 162: I've Done All I Can for You

The name "Lily Savigny" pierced Stella's heart like a thorn.

Her fists clenched until nails dug into her palms. "Does she have to drive Grandpa Edward to his grave?"

Benjamin trembled with rage. "She's doing this deliberately! The master said he'd never let that woman step foot in the Roland mansion as long as he draws breath! Even through the phone, I could hear her venomous words. If I could reach her, I'd tear that vile mouth apart!"

The elderly man's eyes reddened. "First she harmed little Luna, now she's after the master. Young master, how can you marry such a viper?"

Adrian remained silent for a long moment. "Let's see Grandpa first."

"Young master!" Benjamin grabbed his sleeve. "Stella's been so good to you, the children are so well-behaved—why must you insist on..."

"I have to marry her."

Stella didn't wait to hear more. She turned and entered the house.

She nearly collided with the family physician exiting the bedroom. The man eyed her warily. "And you are?"

"Here to see Grandpa Edward."

"The master's condition is critical. Only family may see him."

"I'm Adrian's..."

The doctor's expression darkened as he blocked the doorway. "You're the woman who called and upset him earlier?"

"I..."

Benjamin hurried over to explain. "Dr. Sun, this is the young mistress the master always speaks of!"

The physician paled. "My apologies, Mrs. Roland, I..."

"Call me Miss Valentine," she interrupted. "Adrian and I are already..."

"Is that Stella?" A weak voice called from inside.

Benjamin immediately opened the door. "Master, Stella's come to see you!"

The elderly man on the bed looked ashen, yet struggled to extend a trembling hand. "Come..."

Stella grasped the skeletal fingers, their icy touch sending a tremor through her.

"Just... seeing you makes me happy," Grandpa Edward managed a frail smile. "Where's that worthless grandson of mine? Make him come apologize!"

Adrian stood silently at the bedside.

"On your knees!" The old man suddenly grew agitated. "Unless Stella forgives you, I'll..."

"Grandpa," Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "I must marry Lily."

"You disgrace!" The old man hurled his cane with surprising force.

The wooden rod struck Adrian's forehead, leaving an angry welt.

Suddenly, Grandpa Edward began gasping violently, his face turning ghostly white.

"Call an ambulance!" Stella shouted.

Adrian snapped from his daze and bolted outside.

Under the hospital corridor's sterile lights, Stella finally spoke. "Is she truly worth it?"

"...Yes."

"Even if it kills Grandpa?"

"I have no choice."

Stella let out a bitter laugh. "Adrian Roland, I've done all I can for you."

She turned toward the ICU without a backward glance.
###Chapter 163: Can't You Understand Human Language?

The sunlight was warm as Stella Valentine stepped out of the hospital.

She tilted her face toward the clear blue sky and took a deep breath. With Edward Roland under professional medical care and Adrian Roland keeping constant vigil, her presence would only be redundant.

Her phone buzzed.

[Don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault.]

Mr. Alistair's messages always arrived at the perfect moment.

Her fingers tapped the screen. [I just feel regretful. Mr. Roland was always kind to me, but his wish will never come true now.]

[If you want, you can always remain his granddaughter-in-law.]

Stella froze.

[Is that a proposal?]

[Stella, marriage isn't defined by a piece of paper. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.]

The words unlocked something inside her.

That marriage certificate had trapped her for five years—yet in the end, it had held nothing together.

[Mr. Alistair, how are things on your end?]

[Progressing. And you?]

She exhaled slowly. [The divorce is finalized. Now, I'm taking back the Shi family.]

[Need my help?]

[I want to do this myself.]

[Understood.]

[Will you be home for dinner tonight?]

[Dealing with some complications. Probably not.]

As she pocketed her phone, she saw a nurse approach Adrian.

"Mr. Roland needs overnight care."

"I'll stay," Adrian said, rising to his feet.

——

The sunlight glared harshly outside the Shi family villa.

Charlie Macmillan rolled down the car window. "Miss Valentine, Mr. Alistair asked me to remind you to stay safe."

"When is he coming back?"

"Unclear."

"Tell him to contact me when he returns."

"Of course."

The house was eerily silent.

Stella marched upstairs and pushed open Lily Savigny's bedroom door.

A basin of cold water crashed over Lily's head.

"Ah—!" Lily shrieked awake, her soaked nightgown clinging to her skin. "Stella?! How did you get in?!"

Stella set the empty basin down and picked up another—this one filled with steaming water.

"One more scream, and this one's boiling."

Lily paled. "You wouldn't dare! This is my home!"

"Look again. This is the Shi residence." Stella's smile was icy. "Your phone is in the garden. Shattered."

Lily lunged for the door—only to find it locked.

"Get back in bed." Stella's voice could have frozen hell.

"You're insane!"

"Three. Two—"

Lily scrambled back onto the drenched sheets.

"You poisoned Luna with alcohol."

"So what? You have no proof!"

"You pushed Martha down the stairs."

"She knew too much!" Lily sneered. "Just a servant!"

Stella nodded and clicked off the recorder.

Lily's pupils shrank. "You recorded that?!"

"My father's car accident six years ago." Stella stepped closer. "You tampered with the brakes."

"Guilty!" Lily spat hysterically. "That car's scrap metal now! What can you possibly do?!"

Sophia Durand's voice suddenly rang outside the door. "Lily?"

"Mom! Help!" Lily threw herself against the door. "Stella's trying to kill me!"

Sophia pounded frantically. "Stella! What are you doing to my daughter?!"

Stella leisurely pocketed the recorder and smirked at Lily.

"The game has only just begun."
###Chapter 164: Three-Second Countdown

The doorknob twisted violently in Sophia Durand's grip, screeching with metallic friction.

The heavy wooden door remained firmly locked.

Lily Savigny pounded her fists against the door, the thuds reverberating through the room. "Stella Valentine! What did you do?!"

"Want to leave?" Stella's voice drifted through the crack, icy and indifferent.

Lily trembled with rage. "When Victor gets here, you'll be begging on your knees!"

"Fine. I'll wait."

Victor Lefèvre's furious roar echoed through the villa as he arrived. "Stella Valentine! Open this door now!"

"Uncle, how punctual." Stella chuckled.

"What do you think you're doing?"

"Taking back what's mine. Wasn't that always the plan?"

Victor sneered. "Dream on! The company is under my name now. Lily is marrying Adrian Roland soon. You think—"

A piercing scream cut him off.

Scalding water arced through the air. Lily barely dodged, but the hem of her nightgown caught the spray. Her fair skin instantly reddened and swelled.

"Lily!" Sophia slammed her palms against the door. "Stella, have you lost your mind?!"

"This is just the beginning." Stella tilted the kettle in her hand.

Lily clutched her scalded calf, tears streaming. "Mom! My face can't be ruined! The wedding is next week!"

Victor's face twisted with fury. "Stella! You won't leave here alive today!"

"Good. Then we'll go to hell together." Stella's voice was glacial. "I will ruin Lily's face."

"You wouldn't dare!"

Another shriek of pain.

Sophia yanked Victor back. "Victor! Her face matters more!"

"That ungrateful wretch!" Victor shook with rage. "After all I've done managing her father's company—"

Stella smirked and raised the kettle again.

Lily cowered in the corner, trapped.

"Ah! Mom! Help me!"

Sophia's voice trembled. "Stella, what do you want?"

"Make Victor shut up." Stella's tone was flat. "One more word, and I pour again."

Victor tensed to lash out, but Sophia gripped his arm. "Victor! Lily's marriage secures the company's future!"

"And whose fault is it she got into this mess?" Victor snapped.

Stella's voice cut in smoothly. "Uncle, Lily was only seventeen then. What did she know? Someone must have guided her."

Sophia paled.

Victor's gaze slowly turned toward her.

"Victor, don't listen to her lies—"

"Aunt Sophia," Stella interrupted, "should we ask William Rubenstein to confirm?"

"Which William?" Victor demanded.

Stella smiled. "Ask your wife."

Sophia's face went ashen. The seed of doubt had been planted.

"Not talking?" Stella stepped toward Lily, kettle raised. "Three... two..."

"I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!" Lily screamed, breaking.
###Chapter 165: The Show Begins

Scalding steam hit Lily Savigny's face, making her eyelashes tremble.

She stared fixedly at the basin of boiling water less than twenty centimeters away, her throat tightening.

"Lily! Don't fall for her bluff!" Sophia Durand shrieked from outside the door. "She wouldn’t dare pour it on you!"

A pungent chemical odor suddenly filled the air.

Lily’s pupils contracted in horror as she looked at Stella Valentine.

"Choose," Stella’s voice was feather-light. "Your face, or your position as Mrs. Roland?"

Lily’s nails dug deep into her palms.

She thought of Adrian Roland’s elegant hands, of the decisive stroke of his pen when he signed the divorce papers.

"Mom..." She suddenly looked up. "Remember how Mr. Rubenstein helped you get your medical license?"

Sophia’s face turned deathly pale.

"Levi Realty?" Victor Lefèvre’s icy laugh came from the hallway. "That pimp David Rubenstein?"

"Victor, let me explain—"

"Explain what?" Victor’s furious roar made the door tremble. "Now I understand why those men looked at me like that at your birthday party!"

Stella’s lips curved slightly.

She knew her uncle too well—proud yet insecure, hating nothing more than being laughed at.

The lock clicked open.

Lily stared in disbelief at the effortlessly unlocked door.

"Surprised?" Stella trailed her fingers along the doorframe. "Adrian installed this fingerprint lock himself."

The argument downstairs grew louder.

Stella strolled into the kitchen and took out eggs and toast.

"Uncle," she slid a sandwich toward Victor. "Eat something first."

Victor took a savage bite. "You came here just to stir up trouble!"

"I came to help you." Stella blinked. "Surely you don’t want to keep raising another man’s daughter?"

Victor froze mid-bite.

"Business isn’t going well?" Stella asked casually.

"All because Adrian pulled his investment!" Victor gritted his teeth. "The cash flow is about to collapse!"

Stella set down her butter knife. "I want to return to the company."

"Over my dead body!"

"Uncle," she met his gaze. "If the company goes under, your yacht, your villa—all gone."

The chandelier’s glare was dizzying.

Watching Victor’s shifting expression, Stella knew this performance had only just begun.
###Chapter 166: Divide and Conquer

Victor Lefèvre stiffened his neck. "I can hire a top-tier CEO to manage the company just fine."

"What about the broken capital chain?"

Victor fell silent.

Even the most brilliant CEO couldn't conjure money out of thin air. Projects were stalled, funds frozen—the entire company was on the verge of collapse.

"Uncle," Stella Valentine set down her coffee cup. "I have a solution."

Victor narrowed his eyes. "You? Or that wild man behind you?"

"He could inject capital, but that would mean transferring company shares." Stella smiled faintly. "Would you really allow that?"

Victor's expression darkened. "What do you want?"

"A seat on the board, overseeing operations." Stella met his gaze. "No salary. Just profit shares."

"That's it?" Victor eyed her suspiciously. "What's your angle?"

"Mom and I are moving back in."

Victor nearly choked on his sandwich. "That simple?"

"Mom is used to living here." Stella lowered her lashes. "This place holds Dad's memories."

Victor chewed his sandwich, muttering, "If it weren't for me, the company would've collapsed long ago."

Stella nodded obediently, her nails digging into her palms.

"This company is mine. No one touches it!" Victor growled.

"I just want to fulfill Dad's wishes." Stella lifted her eyes, shimmering with unshed tears.

Victor's expression softened. His brother-in-law had doted on his daughter—it made sense she'd want to protect his legacy.

"You really don't want money?"

"My boyfriend is quite wealthy." Stella shrugged.

That erased Victor's last doubt. He wiped his mouth. "First, we solve the crisis. Then we talk."

"Agreed."

"Wait." Victor suddenly lowered his voice. "Who is this boyfriend of yours?"

"Victor Valence, obviously!" Lily Savigny limped down the stairs. "Stop playing mysterious!"

Victor's eyes lit up. "The Valence heir?"

Stella only smiled.

Victor's mind raced with calculations. Though rebellious, Victor Valence's Unique Jewelry was thriving. If they could secure that connection...

He stole a glance at Stella. Her calm demeanor convinced him further.

Stella watched coldly. Mr. Alistair's "divide and conquer" strategy was working perfectly. Sophia Durand and her daughter now resembled frightened birds.

"Auntie, not joining us for breakfast?" Stella deliberately raised her voice.

Sophia dragged Lily away in retreat.

Inside the guest room, Sophia locked the door.

"Mom!" Lily showed off her burns tearfully. "Stella's a complete lunatic!"

"She has powerful backing." Sophia gritted her teeth. "That madman Victor Valence!"

"What do we do?"

"What did Adrian say?"

"He only cares about the divorce..." Lily bit her lip. "Couldn't care less about the baby."

Sophia smirked. "The marriage certificate is enough. Divorce still entitles you to half his assets."

"But Stella's returning to the company..."

"Over my dead body!" Sophia's eyes gleamed with malice. "Sabotage is easier than success."
###Chapter 167: Beg Me

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Victor Lefèvre sat at the dining table, mechanically chewing his breakfast with a furrowed brow.

Stella Valentine placed a coffee cup gently before him, her gaze skimming over his stormy expression. Sophia Durand's infidelity still weighed heavily on his mind.

"Uncle," she began casually, "Aunt Sophia was crying hysterically last night."

"She dares to cry?!" Victor slammed his palm on the table, making the coffee slosh violently. "She's completely humiliated me!"

Stella lowered her lashes to hide her mocking smile. As always, this man only cared about himself.

The hum of the dishwasher summoned the housekeeper—a middle-aged woman wringing her hands nervously. "Miss Stella, this is my job..."

"What's your salary?" Victor demanded abruptly.

The woman flinched, casting a pleading look at Stella. After receiving a subtle nod, she whispered, "Four thousand...but Madame always finds excuses to deduct..."

"How much?"

"Sometimes half..." Her voice dwindled. "If not for your generosity, sir..."

Victor's face darkened. He stood abruptly. "From today, I'll handle your payments personally!"

Stella seized the moment. "Uncle, after Mother's discharge..."

"Don't worry!" Victor thumped his chest. "No one will dare lay a finger on my sister while I'm here!"

——

2:00 PM, Shi's Jewelry.

Employees whispered as Victor strode into the conference room with Stella in tow.

"Review these by four," he shoved a stack of files toward her. "Present solutions, and you'll earn your seat on the board."

Stella flipped through the documents, her frown deepening. Disorganized accounts. An eight-million-dollar deficit.

Her phone vibrated. A familiar number flashed: [Figured it out yet?]

Her fingers flew across the screen: [How did you know Victor would test me like this?]

[Educated guess.] Came the reply. [Lesson one: Anticipate your opponent's moves.]

Her fingertips trembled slightly: [But I don't know the other company's representatives.]

[Whoever comes, their goal remains—money.] Messages cascaded. [Two choices: Beg me. Or handle it yourself.]

A soft laugh escaped her as she typed: [I choose the latter.]

[Certain? I could resolve everything instantly.]

Stella turned toward the window, sunlight gilding her determined profile: [I need to stand on my own.]

The conference door burst open. A flustered assistant peered in: "Miss Stella! They've arrived early!"
###Chapter 168: The Insecure Mr. Alistair

My phone screen lit up with a message from Mr. Alistair.

["Stella, promise me something?"]

I set down my design sketches and typed quickly. ["What is it?"]

["When this is all over, move abroad with me."]

My fingers hovered over the screen before I replied. ["Wasn't that always the plan?"]

His response came instantly. ["I'm afraid you'll change your mind."]

A soft laugh escaped me. ["Why would you think that?"]

["You're becoming extraordinary."]

I stared at those words, my breath catching.

Another message followed. ["I'm terrified you'll meet someone better. That I won't be enough for you."]

My heart clenched.

Ever since we'd opened our hearts to each other, Mr. Alistair had been wrestling with these insecurities.

["Silly,"] I typed slowly, ["I'm a single mother with two children. How many options do you think I have?"]

["But Victor Valence—"]

["He just wants a suitable wife,"] I cut in. ["I've already turned him down."]

The typing indicator flickered, then stopped.

Minutes passed before his next message appeared. ["It's not others I doubt. It's myself."]

My nose stung with sudden emotion.

Before I could respond, another text arrived. ["Let's focus on today. Remember that soda bottle story from high school?"]

Memory sparked like struck flint.

At precisely 4 PM, Victor Lefèvre knocked on my office door. "The clients are here. Conference room."

I closed my files and stood.

He lowered his voice. "Got a solution yet?"

"We'll see."

His face darkened. "These are major players. Don't screw this up."

"I know my limits."

Victor snorted. "If all else fails, once Lily marries into the Roland family—"

"Uncle," I interrupted, "my career isn't your concern."

In Brilliant Star Group's conference room, three suited men waited.

Victor plastered on a smile. "Mr. Grant, so sorry to keep you—"

The youngest man raised a hand. "Skip the pleasantries. We're here for answers."

Victor immediately shrank behind me, whispering, "You handle this."

The scene felt achingly familiar—just like when he'd hide behind my father after every childhood mishap.

"I'm Stella Valentine." I extended my hand.

Mr. Grant blinked. "You're Stella Valentine?"

"You know me?"

His lips curved oddly. "Adrian Roland moved heaven and earth for—"

"Mr. Grant!" His lawyer cut in sharply.

The man caught himself, shaking my hand. "An honor."

My brow furrowed. "If this is about Adrian—"

"You're divorced?" he interrupted.

"Completely. No ties remain."

Mr. Grant studied me. "Let's hope so. For everyone's sake."

"Is that relevant to our project?"

"Perhaps." He leaned back. "Frankly, I'm more interested in you. Beyond design talent, what makes you special?"

The room plunged into silence.

Every eye locked onto me.
###Chapter 169: No Destruction, No Construction

"Mr. Grant, with all due respect, what exactly did you mean by that?" I set down my coffee cup, the porcelain clinking sharply against the table.

Mr. Grant stroked his Patek Philippe watch, his smile dripping with condescension. "Miss Valentine, with your... assets, why work so hard? Wouldn't it be easier to play the dutiful designer wife beside Victor Valence?"

My fingertips turned ice-cold.

"Mutual respect is the foundation of any negotiation." I held his gaze. "You don't seem here to discuss business today."

"I'm simply offering you a better path." He spread his hands. "Sometimes ignorance is bliss."

"Who's your employer?"

"Xavier." He dropped the name like a casual afterthought.

Xavier?

My mind raced through every connection, but came up blank.

His assistant slid a laptop across the table. The numbers on screen made my stomach drop.

"Late fees have accumulated to this amount." Mr. Grant tapped the display. "Further delays will leave us no choice but litigation."

Victor Lefèvre paled. "Mr. Grant, our company's accounts are—"

"Pay up or face prison time." The lawyer cut in coldly. "Minimum seven years."

I caught the strange gleam in Victor's eyes, the ghost of a smirk twisting his lips.

What game was he playing?

Buzz—

My phone vibrated.

[No destruction, no construction.]

I pressed my lips together, tucking the phone away. Mr. Alistair always understood.

"Stella!" Victor suddenly grabbed my wrist. "You said you had a solution!"

"My apologies, Uncle. I overestimated myself."

"What about Victor Valence? Make him help!" His voice turned shrill. "I'm your blood relative!"

I gave a bitter laugh. "Why would Mr. Valence spend a dime for me?"

"Doesn't he adore you?"

The conference room door slammed open.

"Who said I wouldn't?"

Victor Valence stormed in wearing his signature studded leather jacket, motorcycle helmet crashing onto the table. "I'll cover the debt. She's mine."

Silence swallowed the room.

He sprawled into a chair, boots propped on the conference table. "Amount? Wire transfer or check?"

Mr. Grant's eyes narrowed. "Young Master Valence is certain about meddling?"

"Cut the crap." Victor turned to me. "Marry me or not?"

My temple throbbed.

"We need to talk. Outside." I yanked him toward the door.

"Hey, easy there!" He grinned, leaning closer. "Registry office first, then bank transfer?"

"Shut up!"

I offered Mr. Grant an apologetic nod. "Please excuse us for a private discussion."

Mr. Grant exhaled a cigar smoke ring. "By all means. This performance is quite entertaining."

In the hallway, Victor's playful demeanor vanished.

"That old bastard Xavier is cornering you." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Mr. Alistair sent me."

My pulse jumped.

So it was all an act?

"What now?"

He pressed closer, breath hot against my ear. "Listen carefully. Here's the plan—"

Before he could finish, Victor's enraged scream tore through the conference room:

"Stella Valentine! Get your ass back here now!"
###Chapter 170: His World Only Has Me

The air in the conference room was suffocatingly tense.

Stella Valentine rose gracefully, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. Victor Lefèvre's face turned pale, then green, but he didn't dare utter a word.

"Uncle, excuse me." She gave a slight nod, her skirt swirling elegantly as she turned.

Victor collapsed into his chair, sweat beading on his forehead. As long as Victor Valence helped him, he could avoid prison.

"Mr. Lefèvre." Mr. Grant suddenly spoke.

"Yes? What is it, Mr. Grant?"

"You're the company's legal representative, correct?"

The lawyer behind him immediately flipped open his notebook, pen scratching against paper.

Victor leapt to his feet. "No, no! I'm just temporarily filling in! Once my sister recovers, it'll be transferred back!"

Mr. Grant smiled meaningfully. "How... loyal of you."

The break room door clicked shut softly.

Victor Valence leaned against the coffee machine, a teasing smirk on his lips. "Miss Valentine, dragging me into a place like this in broad daylight—isn't that inappropriate?"

"Mr. Valence, this isn't the time for jokes." Stella frowned.

"I'm being completely serious." He spread his hands innocently.

Stella took a deep breath. "Why did you suddenly come to the company?"

"You texted me to come."

"Me?" She looked baffled.

Victor pulled out his phone. The screen displayed a message: "Let's end things here. I still can't forget Adrian Roland..."

He mimicked a woman's voice as he read it aloud, then shuddered. "Joy said when women say no, they mean yes. So I came specially to comfort you. Touched?"

"I didn't send that." Her voice was firm.

After comparing numbers, Victor's expression darkened. "Not you? Then who?"

"I think I know." Stella's lips curled into a cold smile.

Sophia Durand and her daughter had always mistaken Mr. Alistair for Victor Valence. This message, deliberately mentioning Adrian Roland, was clearly meant to drive a wedge between them.

"What's really going on?" Victor pressed.

"No time to explain." Stella lowered her voice. "Later, just say you don't have enough funds to help me."

"But this is your family's company—"

"Do as I say!"

When they returned to the conference room, Victor was bowing obsequiously as he poured tea for Mr. Grant. Seeing them, his expression twisted. "What took so long? Transfer the money now!"

Victor Valence yawned. "Sorry. Not enough funds."

"What?!" Victor Lefèvre's face turned livid.

"And..." Victor Valence gave Stella a disdainful once-over. "A woman who's already had a child isn't worth this much money."

Mr. Grant stood. "See you in court, Mr. Lefèvre."

In a fit of rage, Victor Lefèvre backhanded Stella, slamming her against the wall. Her right cheek swelled instantly, blood trickling from her lip.

"Stop!" Victor Valence seized his wrist.

"Fine! Just fine!" Victor Lefèvre jerked free, jabbing a finger at Stella. "You'll pay for this!"

The door slammed shut behind him.

Victor Valence moved to help her, but she stepped back.

"Your uncle is a monster!"

"He's not my uncle." Stella wiped the blood from her mouth. "Just scum."

Victor ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "Your family's drama is exhausting."

"Mr. Valence, we shouldn't meet again." Her voice was calm. "Mr. Alistair might misunderstand."

"Who is this Mr. Alistair?" Victor suddenly stepped closer. "What does he have that I don't?"

"You're luckier than him." Stella met his gaze. "You have family. A career. But his world... only has me."

Victor's pupils contracted. "An orphan?"

Stella stiffened.

"Interesting." A smirk tugged at his lips. "Not many in Houston fit that description. Just wait—I'll find out who he is soon enough."
###Chapter 171: A Secret Between Men

"Victor!" Stella grabbed his sleeve abruptly.

Victor Valence halted mid-step, turning with lingering fury in his eyes.

Stella took a deep breath. "Stop investigating Mr. Alistair. I'm begging you."

He scoffed. "If he's so perfect, why is he hiding? Your uncle and that Grant are trampling all over you. Where is he?"

"He has his own matters to handle."

"So I'm the only one with nothing better to do?" A vein throbbed at Victor's temple. "I left my entire team to rush here, and this is how you treat me? Stella, I swear I'll find out who he is!"

She massaged her temples. The company crisis was exhausting enough without dealing with this spoiled heir.

Her phone buzzed.

The screen flashed: Mr. Alistair Calling.

The moment she answered, that familiar voice spoke: "Give the phone to Victor."

"How did you know he's here?"

"I saw him enter."

Her pulse jumped. "Mr. Alistair, he's just—"

"Who says there's nothing between us?" Victor snatched the phone. "I, Victor Valence, intend to marry Stella Valentine! If you're a real man, face me!"

"Shut up!" Stella trembled with rage.

Victor ignored her. "In Houston, only Adrian Roland and I meet the criteria. This fraud is manipulating you!"

"Stay out of my affairs."

"Fine! When you're brokenhearted again, don't come crying to me."

"Wouldn't dream of it."

Mr. Alistair's deep voice resonated through the speaker: "Did Victor Lefèvre hurt you?"

"He's powerless now." Her tone softened.

A quiet chuckle. "That confident?"

"Thanks to your brilliant strategies."

"Do what you must. I'll appear if danger arises."

She tightened her grip on the phone. "But Adrian—"

"You matter more." His tenderness sent shivers through her. "Now hand me to Victor."

After a hesitation, she complied.

Victor took the phone with a sneer.

When the call ended, his expression shifted dramatically. He studied Stella with unreadable intensity before walking away without a word.

"Mr. Alistair?" She brought the phone back to her ear.

"A secret between men." Amusement colored his low laugh.

"...I see."

"Angry?"

"Not at all."

His delighted laughter curled around her. "My little princess has learned to pout."

Her ears burned. "I'm not that girl anymore—"

"But I miss the Stella who wore floral sundresses, proud as a little peacock." His voice turned molten. "We'll talk tonight."

The line went dead.

Victor had vanished from the hallway.

Before she could process it, a rough hand seized her wrist.

"Uncle Victor?"

Victor Lefèvre stormed toward her with legal team in tow. "Grant is suing us! If this company falls, you're going down with it!"
###Chapter 172: The Ungrateful Wolf

Victor Lefèvre grabbed Stella Valentine's wrist and dragged her into the legal department office. "Hold her down!"

Four burly legal officers immediately surrounded her, pinning her firmly into a chair.

"Stella, don't blame your uncle for being harsh." Victor pulled a document from his briefcase and slammed it onto the table. "I'm going to make your mother sign this corporate representative change agreement. If she refuses to take the fall for me, you won't leave this room."

His eyes gleamed with the ferocity of a wolf.

Stella smirked inwardly.

This ungrateful traitor.

She tried to struggle, but the four men tightened their grip. A sharp pain shot through her wrist, already bruising.

"Uncle..." Her eyes suddenly reddened, voice trembling. "Mom just had surgery. If she goes to prison, she'll die... She's your own sister!"

Victor faltered for a moment, avoiding her gaze. "Seven years at most... She's only in her fifties. She'll have plenty of time left when she gets out."

"No! I won't let Mom suffer like this!"

"Stella," Victor softened his tone, coaxing. "After your mother goes in, I'll take good care of you and the kids. They'll attend the best schools—better than you struggling alone with them. Your mother's old. The children's future matters more, right?"

Stella lowered her head, the corner of her lips curling imperceptibly.

She had been worried Victor would grow suspicious, but Mr. Grant's debt collection today had unexpectedly played into her hands.

The children's future was important—but so was her mother!

"Stella, wait here." Victor shot his subordinates a meaningful look. "I'm going to see your mother now."

The moment the office door locked behind him, Stella flexed her aching wrist and took a step forward.

"Stop!" one of the legal officers barked.

Stella turned slowly, her gaze landing on his name tag. "Legal Department... Liu Chen?"

The man glared at her fiercely.

"Liu Chen," she said softly, "you'd better treat me with respect. Soon, my mother will be the company's legal representative."

Liu Chen paled, exchanging panicked glances with the other three.

Stella elegantly settled into the executive chair, fingertips lightly tapping the desk. "The legal representative should have been my father. Half his shares were transferred to me, and the other half... by inheritance law, belong to my mother. Unauthorized changes to corporate representation—how many years does that carry? You know better than I do."

......

An hour later, Victor stormed back into the office, clutching the signed document.

"Process the corporate representative change immediately!" He threw the papers at Liu Chen. "The sooner, the better!"

Liu Chen didn't move. Instead, he looked at Stella.

"What are you waiting for? Mr. Grant said we'll receive the subpoena in two or three days!"

Liu Chen gritted his teeth and hurried out with the document.

"Stella," Victor wiped his sweat, "your uncle needs to go abroad for a bit. Take care of the company for a few days."

Trying to flee?

Perfect.

"But I have no experience..."

"Just a few days! If you really can't handle it, ask Victor Valence for help!" Victor snatched his jacket and bolted. "I'm leaving!"

Stella stood by the window, watching his car speed toward the airport. Finally, she allowed the cold smile to surface.

"Notify all department managers," she turned and commanded. "Meeting at four."

......

"What? The legal representative is Grace Laurent now?" Sophia Durand's nails dug into her palm as she took the call. "What about Victor Valence?"

"He did come."

"Is he really 'Mr. Alistair'?"

"Who else could repay an eight-figure debt so easily?"

Sophia's teeth ground audibly. "So the deal went through?"

"No. Stella refused."

"Is she insane?"

"Not sure about the details..."

Sophia cut in sharply. "What's this about the corporate representative change? What scheme is Stella pulling now?"

"Victor forced Grace to sign. The paperwork should be finalized by now."

"Victor's lost his mind?" Sophia's voice rose. "Where is he?"

"He flew overseas an hour ago."

Sophia suddenly calmed.

If Grace took the fall for Victor... given her health, she might not survive prison. With two children in tow, the Valence family might reject Stella. Then, just like with Adrian Roland...

"Keep watching the company." She hung up.

Lily Savigny rushed downstairs. "Mom, Victor Valence didn't help Stella?"

Sophia frowned. "But something feels off..."

"Isn't this good?" Lily chirped. "Stella can't enter the company now!"

"Fool!" Sophia snapped. "Grace is the legal representative now!"
###Chapter 173: If Time Could Rewind

The meeting ended as city lights began illuminating the night outside.

Stella Valentine stepped out of the company building, tilting her face toward the starry sky as she exhaled deeply.

Victor Lefèvre's restructuring had been more ruthless than she anticipated. Veteran employees who'd worked for her father for decades had been systematically purged under various pretexts. Only his handpicked "elites" remained.

Yet these so-called talents couldn't even handle basic operations. The company survived solely on the Valentine and Roland family fortunes. Any ordinary business would have collapsed by now.

Her phone vibrated with a message from Mr. Alistair: ["Done with work? Waiting at River of Your Heart."]

The familiar café name sent a tremor through her.

That hidden corner shop held too many memories. During exam seasons, Adrian Roland would tutor her there. The rich aroma of coffee blending with his clear explanations remained her most treasured fragment of youth.

In the distance, she spotted Mr. Alistair's tall silhouette under a streetlamp. Golden light elongated his shadow as he stared at the ground, lost in thought.

"Waiting long?" she asked softly.

He looked up, fingertips grazing her cheek. "Tired?"

"Manageable."

"Want a toffee hazelnut latte? I'll get it."

Stella abruptly gripped his arm. "Don't!"

"What's wrong?"

After scanning their surroundings, she hurriedly pulled him away. Only when they turned the corner did she stop, breathless. "The owner knows Adrian and me. You'd be recognized."

Mr. Alistair chuckled, drawing her into his embrace. "Breathe." His chest felt warm and solid against her, carrying faint traces of tobacco and cologne—an unexpectedly pleasant combination.

"Being mistaken for him wouldn't matter," he murmured, stroking her back. "Adrian likely won't return here."

Stella stiffened. Of course. Their story had ended long ago. These shared memory lanes probably meant nothing to him now.

"You handled today perfectly." His fingers tousled her hair. "Victor fears losses most. This debt crisis will make him voluntarily relinquish legal control."

"About Ethan today—"

"The little social butterfly thrived." Amusement danced in his eyes. "His teacher said he made a dozen friends already."

Stella suppressed a laugh. "He must've bragged about his superhero dad again."

"Which means I should quit smoking." He feigned seriousness. "Can't set a bad example."

A sudden worry gripped her. "Wasn't it risky picking him up from school? With Adrian and Lily Savigny's recent media coverage—"

"Stella." His index finger touched her lips. "Victor Valence was right. I can't lurk in shadows forever. As your man, I should stand beside you openly."

Her eyes grew moist. "But your identity—"

"Hiding terrifies me less than failing to protect you." His lips brushed hers. "You're becoming the old Stella again—eyes sparkling with starlight."

Her cheeks warmed. "Twenty-year-old me was naive. If I could redo it, I'd prioritize caring for Grace and earning enough for Ethan's treatments."

"But without Luna's cord blood, his surgery—"

"Then I'd imitate Lily." Mischief flickered in her gaze. "Drug Adrian, get pregnant, and disappear."

Mr. Alistair's low laugh vibrated against her. "Not a bad plan."

"If it were you," she lifted her face, "would you have come for me six years ago? Taken me away when I was most helpless?"

He gazed at the stars, voice barely audible. "If time could rewind... I'd hold you tight. No matter what, never let go."

"Would you have met me before Adrian did?"

"I'd replace him as your lifelong guardian."

Stella pressed her ear to his chest, listening to his steady heartbeat. "I wish you'd appeared sooner."

"My second greatest regret," his arms tightened, "is not doing so."

"And the first?" she mumbled. "Not seeing Edward Roland before he passed?"

"Yes and no." His chin rested atop her head. "When we're abroad after this ends, I'll tell you."

In the darkness, he held her closer, his expression unreadable.

His life's deepest regret remained trusting Lily Savigny all those years ago.
###Chapter 174: A Wave of Jealousy

The sudden ringing of her phone shattered the quiet.

Stella Valentine reached for her bag, but Mr. Alistair pulled her back, his arm tightening around her waist. "No work calls after hours," he muttered into her hair.

"What if it's personal?" She squirmed slightly. "Let me go—"

"Especially not Victor Valence's." His voice turned steely. "No calls today. From anyone."

She tilted her head to study his clenched jaw and burst into laughter. "So possessive? Are you jealous?"

"Yes." He nipped at her earlobe. "He gave up the quadrennial motorcycle race for you. I want to punch him right now."

Her shoulders shook with mirth. "He dressed like a rockstar today, I thought—"

Seizing his distraction, she twisted free and shoved the phone in his face. "See? It's Martha."

With visible reluctance, he released her.

Ethan's exuberant voice exploded through the speaker the moment she answered. "Mommy! I miss you!"

Her expression softened instantly. "I miss you too, sweetheart. I'll be home soon—"

"No, no!" The boy dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Grandma Martha said you and Daddy are having alone time!"

Her ears burned. "She told you that?"

"Yeah!" His pitch climbed with excitement. "She said when you're alone, I get a baby brother! Then I'll be the big brother!"

Stella choked on air.

The phone vanished from her grip. Mr. Alistair's baritone rumbled, "You want a brother?"

"Yes! Can you magic one like Sun Wukong? Tommy has one! I'm the only one without!"

"I can do anything—except that."

"Whyyy?"

His gaze slid to Stella's crimson face. "Mommy has to agree first."

"I'll ask her! Mommy loves me best!"

Flustered, she wrestled the phone back, cheeks scalding. "Ethan, bedtime now—"

"Pleeease, Mommy?"

She shot a glare at the smirking instigator. He took the phone, tone shifting to solemn. "A brother would make Mommy very tired. Let's help her get strong first, okay?"

"Okay! Daddy's the best!"

Stella massaged her temples. The father-son duo made her the villain.

"Quite the charmer," she said tartly. "Even his birth father wasn't this smooth."

He pulled her closer. "Then let me be his father forever."

———

Dawn found his side of the bed empty.

After dropping Ethan at school, Stella drove straight to the hospital. Grace Laurent sat propped in bed, scrolling through baby food recipes with noticeably better color.

"Mom."

"Stella!" Grace beamed. "The doctor said I can leave today!"

Warmth bloomed in Stella's chest—another of Mr. Alistair's arrangements.

"You look healthier." Grace peered closer. "Have you gained weight?"

Self-consciously, Stella touched her cheek. "Really?"

"A mother knows." Grace produced a handkerchief bundle from under her pillow. "I saved enough for a small apartment—"

The unfolded cloth revealed neatly stacked bills.

Stella seized her mother's wrist. "Where's your jade bracelet?"

Grace avoided her eyes. "Sold it. The children need—"

"That was Dad's love token!"

"He'd approve." Grace wiped tears. "He always wanted grandchildren."

Stella's throat tightened. She clasped the wrinkled hands. "No apartment. Mom, you're coming home."

"But your uncle took—"

"From today," Stella said fiercely, "that house is ours forever."
###Chapter 175: I Just Want to Make You Happy

The hospital cashier handed over a document. "Ms. Valentine, there's a remaining balance of $153,000 from your husband's medical deposit."

Stella took the paper, her fingers trembling slightly.

She couldn't touch this money without permission.

"Let my husband come another day to process the refund," she said softly.

As they stepped outside, Grace Laurent squinted against the harsh sunlight.

"Ma'am, try these." The driver Charlie Macmillan offered her a pair of sunglasses.

Grace studied the young man with surprise. "You are...?"

"The boss sent me to drive you and Ms. Valentine home."

Grace smiled warmly. "Young people these days are so considerate."

The car glided smoothly through the streets.

"This boy drives just like your father—so steady," Grace murmured to her daughter.

Stella squeezed her mother's hand. "Mom, I'll make sure those who hurt Dad pay for it."

Grace sighed but remained silent.

When they arrived at the Valentine estate, Charlie hurried to open their doors.

"Ma'am, the boss asked me to apologize for his absence. He's been extremely busy lately—"

Grace waved dismissively. "No need for formalities."

Suddenly lowering her voice, she asked, "Young man, does your boss's family... know about our Stella?"

Charlie maintained his polite smile. "The boss only has his grandfather now. The old gentleman adores Ms. Valentine."

Grace's expression shifted abruptly. "Wait—isn't your boss Mr. Valence?"

"Mom," Stella said wearily, "I've told you before. Victor Valence and I have nothing between us."

Realization dawned on Grace. "So it's someone else? What's his name?"

Stella bit her lip.

She still didn't know Mr. Alistair's real name.

Charlie smoothly intervened. "The boss said he'll visit you personally."

Grace relaxed slightly. "At least he has manners."

A shrill scream erupted from inside the mansion. "Where are my roses?!"

Sophia Durand stormed outside, her face purpling with rage at the sight of the demolished garden.

"Who authorized this?!" She grabbed a worker's arm.

The laborer timidly pointed toward the gate. "That gentleman's orders..."

Sophia finally noticed the trio at the entrance, her eyes flashing venom. "Grace Laurent! Was this your doing?"

Charlie stepped protectively in front of the women. "My boss's decision. Mrs. Valentine prefers sunflowers. From now on, only sunflowers will grow here."

Grace turned to her daughter in astonishment. "Stella, did you tell him about my love for sunflowers?"

Stella shook her head, equally bewildered.

Her phone vibrated.

[I've purchased all surrounding land. Soon this entire area will bloom with sunflowers.]

Her fingers flew across the screen. [How did you know?]

[Stella, that doesn't matter.]
[I just want to make you happy.]
###Chapter 176: The Irretrievable Youth

[I'm happy.]

The twisted expression on Sophia Durand's face filled Stella Valentine with immense satisfaction.

[Good. The room has been redecorated. Go see if you like it.]

Stella's fingers trembled slightly. [Didn't Lily Savigny always occupy my room?]

[Just go take a look.]

The villa's grand doors suddenly swung open. A dozen familiar faces filed out—all former staff who had worked for the Shi family years ago.

"Madame, Miss, welcome home."

Martha Langley, the head housekeeper, had tears in her eyes. She had served the Shi household for over two decades and was like a sister to Grace Laurent.

When Victor Lefèvre seized the villa, she was the first to be dismissed.

Grace had pleaded desperately but failed to keep these loyal employees.

Charlie Macmillan made an elegant gesture. "Mrs. Laurent, Miss Valentine, welcome home."

As they walked through the garden, Stella noticed workers bustling about. The roses had been uprooted, replaced by young sunflower sprouts.

Charlie positioned himself discreetly behind them, shielding the mother and daughter from any potential outburst from Sophia.

"Mr. Alistair ordered sunflowers planted across five miles within three days."

Grace was too stunned to speak.

Stella remained composed. "When did this start?"

"The garden renovation began last night. The land was purchased three days ago."

"So quickly?"

"Mr. Alistair made a very generous offer."

Stella couldn't resist asking, "How much did it cost?"

Charlie smiled without answering. "He asked me not to say."

"Why?"

"You understand."

Stella immediately fell silent.

Planting sunflowers in this prime real estate area? Some extravagances were better left unknown.

Inside, decorators were hard at work.

"Mr. Alistair requested the original design be restored. It should take about five days."

Grace looked surprised. "He knew what our home used to look like?"

"Yes."

"Has he been here before?"

Stella whirled around. "Mr. Alistair visited my home?"

Realizing his slip, Charlie lowered his head in frustration.

"When?"

"When Mr. Alistair wants to go somewhere, he finds a way." Charlie changed the subject. "The second-floor room is ready. Miss Valentine, see if it meets your expectations."

"What about Lily?"

Grace sighed. "Isn't she marrying Adrian Roland? She probably moved to the Roland residence."

"That wedding won't happen." The words escaped Charlie's lips before he could stop himself. He immediately covered his mouth in dismay.

Stella narrowed her eyes. "What do you mean?"

Charlie wished he could bite his tongue off. His employer had too many secrets for him to handle.

The second-floor bedroom was an exact replica of how it looked six years ago.

Even the limited-edition Snoopy plush on the bed was identical—the original's ear had worn off from washing, while this one still had its tag attached.

"Was this toy hard to find?"

"Mr. Alistair traveled to several countries before convincing a collector to part with it."

Stella's heart skipped a beat. "So when he disappeared recently, he was searching for this?"

"Most likely."

Grace suddenly asked, "Where will Sophia and the others stay?"

"The villa will be restored to its original state. There's no room for them." Charlie assured her, "Security will be tight. Contact me immediately if anything happens."

Standing in the familiar room, Stella felt as if she'd stepped back in time.

Eight years.

This room, once filled with a teenage girl's dreams, now only held one painful memory clearly—the rest were fragments featuring a boy in a school uniform.

In her memories, he'd always open his arms at dusk and say, "Come on, let's go see the stars."

She would leap from the second floor without hesitation, landing safely in his embrace.

Later, as she grew taller, she nearly knocked him over a few times. He'd tease her with a laugh, "You've gained weight again."

She would sulk until he coaxed her out of it.

Now...

The windowsill remained.

But the boy who caught her was going to marry someone else.

Did it hurt?

Without love, there was no pain.

But youth had been so beautiful—so beautiful she once thought she could live off those memories forever.

Until Adrian Roland taught her life's cruelest lesson in the harshest way.

"Miss Valentine, any other changes needed?"

Stella shook her head. "No."

"Would you like to see the other rooms?"

"No need." She took a deep breath. "I trust Mr. Alistair's work."

His promise of restoration would be flawless.
###Chapter 177: The Secret List at Eighteen

Stella Valentine stood before the old house, her fingertips lightly tracing the weathered wall. Time had left its marks here, taking away too many memories with it.

Grace Laurent's eyes reddened.

"Mom?"

"It's nothing." Grace turned her face away, voice trembling. "It just feels like... your father is still here."

Stella's heart clenched. She grasped her mother's shaking hand.

Charlie Macmillan approached with blueprints. "Miss Valentine, there's a detail we need to confirm."

"Go ahead."

"The banyan tree Martha planted in the garden years ago... should we restore it?"

Stella's breath caught.

That tree.

It held all the secrets of her girlhood.

Adrian Roland used to wait for her beneath it. They'd climb to the top to watch stars, staying there all night. Countless youthful confessions hid among those rustling leaves.

"No." She said softly. "Plant sunflowers instead."

Charlie nodded and made a note.

"One more thing." Stella suddenly remembered. "The children—"

"Mr. Alistair has arranged everything." Charlie handed her a schedule. "Ethan will be under my care, Luna with Martha. They'll visit the Roland family estate on weekends."

Stella froze.

"He even thought of..."

"Mr. Alistair never wants you to worry." Charlie gave her a meaningful look. "He only hopes you'll always trust him."

Stella frowned. "What's happening?"

"Soon." Charlie avoided the question. "You'll understand very soon."

Grace wiped her tears and approached. "Will that gentleman... be coming tonight?"

The tips of Stella's ears turned pink.

Countless nights, that man had arrived in silence. Vanishing before dawn like a dream she never wanted to wake from.

"It's too late." She murmured. "Another time."

Charlie smiled without responding.

He knew—no matter the distance, that man would come.

After seeing Charlie off, the old servants gathered around. Stella quietly slipped away, retreating to her childhood room.

Floral bedsheets. Floral curtains. Dresses hanging in the closet—identical to those Adrian had given her.

She collapsed onto the bed and quickly fell asleep.

In her dream, she returned to eighteen.

At the desk, her younger self chewed a pencil while writing a wish list:
"Plant sunflowers for Mom."
"Take Dad to see the northern lights."
"Learn to make braised pork—just to tease Adrian!"

The pen paused, then added in smaller script:
"Watch stars with him on a Ferris wheel. If he's smart enough to figure it out."

In her sleep, she felt arms encircle her from behind.

The familiar scent of eau de cologne filled her senses.

"You're breaking our agreement..." She mumbled drowsily. "If Dad finds out—"

The arms around her suddenly tightened.

Stella jolted awake.
###Chapter 178 Standing on Giants' Shoulders

"Mr. Alistair..."

"Mmm." His voice sounded weary through the phone. "I planned to wait downstairs, but someone slept like a log and didn't answer my calls."

Stella Valentine fumbled for her phone on the bed.

Several missed calls glared from the screen.

She tugged her hair in frustration. "I'm sorry. I was dead asleep."

His strong arms pulled her back against his chest. "You've exhausted yourself these past years. You needed the rest."

"But you're the one working overtime—managing the company while overseeing my home renovation."

His low chuckle vibrated against her. "I don't mind at all."

"Mr. Alistair, do you ever sleep? My father used to say successful people master efficient rest."

"Then I should thank my future father-in-law for the compliment."

Heat flooded Stella's cheeks as she snuggled deeper into his embrace. "...My father died because of a conspiracy."

"I know."

"I'll make Lily Savigny and Sophia Durand pay!"

"They will. Karma always collects its dues."

"How are the kids?"

"Thriving. Ethan uses me as a climbing wall, and Luna's all smiles lately. Martha says her appetite's doubled."

Warmth blossomed in Stella's chest. "Did they miss me?"

"Ethan kept asking where you went."

"What did you tell him?"

"That superheroes take shifts, and it's Mommy's turn to save the world."

"...He bought that?"

"Absolutely. He was amazed both parents are superheroes."

Imagining her son's awestruck face, Stella giggled. "Won't you feel embarrassed when they grow up?"

Amusement colored his voice. "Embarrassment is for other people."

"You—mmph!" She pressed fingers to her tingling lips. "Mr. Alistair, you've turned wicked!"

"My apologies. I lost control."

The lingering warmth made her touch her mouth absently.

Two months with him felt like a decade's worth of living.

After weathering storms, she treasured this ordinary happiness.

But the man behind her clearly had other ideas.

October in Houston still clung to summer's heat.

Their entangled bodies spiked the room temperature.

His scorching breath hit her neck in ragged bursts.

She heard his swallow. Felt his...physical reaction.

After six years of abstinence, panic set in.

Even with two children, intimacy remained foreign territory.

"Let's—let's discuss business! With my mother as legal representative now, we should—ah!"

He nipped her shoulder.

She curled into a defensive ball.

"Stella, I'm only human."

"I know...but my mother's downstairs..."

"First-floor bedrooms have triple soundproofing. Unless you set off firecrackers..."

"...You planned this?"

"Learning from history. Where Adrian Roland failed, I succeeded."

Flustered, she swatted him. "You're proud of that?"

His laughter rumbled. "Enough teasing. I promised to wait until you're ready."

"Mr. Alistair..."

"About business—today's strategy is 'Play Weak to Win.'"

Understanding dawned.

"Victor Lefèvre craves flattery and crumbles under pressure. Forcing him would make him liquidate shares. We'll appease him first."

Stella nodded. "With combined shares from the original Shi and Roland families, he holds over 50% control."

"Luckily he distrusts even Sophia. Pity he's driven company value down 50% in six years."

Her lips twisted. "Business was never his forte. My parents' charity invited a wolf into our home."

"The corporate world rewards vigilance, not virtue."

"I understand."

His arms tightened. "Prove your worth. Earn his trust gradually."

"Understood."

"One more thing." His jaw clenched. "Stay away from Victor Valence. That brat's been a thorn in my side."

"What did he do?"

"Hmph."

He refused to elaborate like a petulant child.

The mystery solved itself next day when she met Joy Fairsprene.

"Victor Valence?" Joy stirred her lemon water. "He's obsessively investigating Houston's orphanages. His brother thinks he's having a breakdown."

"He actually went through with it?"

Joy sighed. "Stubborn as a mule. But if he uncovers Mr. Alistair's real name... Aren't you curious, Stella?"
###Chapter 179: Familiar Yet Strange

Stella Valentine nodded softly. "He's Mr. Alistair. That's all that matters."

Joy Fairsprene propped her chin on her hand, sighing dramatically. "Julian Valois is such a closed book. No matter how hard I try, I can't get him to open up."

"Don't push him," Stella said, squeezing her friend's hand. "I've made my peace with things. But you should think carefully about your relationship with Julian."

Joy suddenly deflated, slumping onto the table. "He's perfect in every way—except he won't give me the freedom I want." She shook her soda cup. "Like this cola. He always says it's unhealthy and insists on making me herbal tea instead."

Stella studied the spirited young woman before her, seeing a bird yearning for open skies.

"What about Harry Vance?"

"We haven't spoken in ages." Joy perked up. "Oh! His concert is this weekend. I still have your ticket—are you going?"

Stella shook her head. "I've been too busy lately."

"Ugh, just thinking about taking over the family business someday, plus marriage and kids..." Joy clutched her head theatrically. "It makes my scalp tingle!"

Stella smiled without comment. She was still navigating her own marital maze—who was she to advise others?

"Enough of this!" Joy sprang up. "Give me a tour of your place!"

As they descended the spiral staircase, Joy suddenly pointed at a wall painting. "This is so much better than Sophia Durand's tacky decor! At her birthday party last time, everything was gold-plated—nearly blinded me!"

Stella's gaze lingered on the oil paintings. These were her late mother Grace Laurent's works, meticulously recovered by Mr. Alistair.

"Is this one of the night sky?" Joy leaned closer. "With your mom's signature in the corner?"

"Yes."

"Mr. Alistair is incredible!" Joy marveled. "Even the placement is exact. Stella, do you remember the original layout?"

Stella's heart skipped. She'd grown up in this house, yet couldn't recall each painting's precise location. Mr. Alistair claimed he'd been here before, but she had no memory of him.

After Joy left, Stella sat alone in the living room, staring at the wall.

"Little Star?" Grace came downstairs, concerned. "What's wrong?"

"Mom... are these paintings in their original positions?"

Grace chuckled. "I don't remember. What matters is that seeing them feels like coming home."

Stella fell into thought.

"That young man who helped you..." Grace patted her daughter's hand. "Though I've never met him, he feels strangely familiar."

Stella's eyes grew moist. "Mom..."

"He must have his reasons." Grace smiled gently. "As long as you're happy, I accept him."

Stella laughed through tears. "That's not very principled of you."

"Principles matter less than my daughter's happiness." Grace paused. "But... tell him to use the front door instead of climbing the wall."

Stella flushed crimson. "You... you saw that?"

"I got up for water last night and noticed." Grace winked. "I'm not old-fashioned, but you just had Luna..." She lowered her voice. "Remember to be careful."
###Chapter 180: You Are My Weakness

[Sir, you've been caught.]

[?]

[My mom saw you climbing through my window last night.]

[Mhm.]

[You knew?!]

[She almost called the police, thinking you were a burglar.]

[And then?]

[I said, "Good evening, Mrs. Laurent. I'm here to see Stella." She let me upstairs and told me to be careful.]

Stella Valentine facepalmed.

What kind of first meeting was this?

[My mom's too nice. Anyone else would've chased you out with a broom.]

[They wouldn't.]

[You sound like you know her well?]

[I told you—I know everything about you.]

[Even the order of paintings in our living room?]

[Is that difficult?]

[...Mr. Alistair, you're such a show-off.]

[Annoying?]

Stella gritted her teeth as she typed: [Show-off, as in Versailles!]

Her phone suddenly rang.

Mr. Alistair's voice carried confusion: "I just checked. My connection is definitely 5G."

Stella burst out laughing. "Sir, I've discovered your weakness."

"What?"

"You're completely clueless about internet slang." She counted on her fingers. "'Versailles' means you're flexing. '2G network' means you're outdated."

Silence stretched for a few seconds.

"...I don't pay attention to these trends."

"Now I'll have the upper hand in arguments."

"We won't argue." His voice deepened. "Besides... you already know my real weakness."

"Slow internet?"

"You."

......

Adrian Roland ended the call just as Charlie rushed in.

"Mr. Roland, Mr. Xavier sent messengers again."

"Report."

"Same old rhetoric—saying the entire business empire could be yours if you agree." Charlie lowered his voice. "He claims... you shouldn't sacrifice your future for a woman."

Adrian's fist clenched violently.

"What else?"

"That... he knows you plan to leave, but won't let you throw everything away."

The office temperature seemed to plummet.

"Double the security detail on Stella."

Charlie hesitated. "But if Mr. Xavier really makes a move—"

"I'll protect her myself." Adrian grabbed his jacket. "Once we settle the Shi family matters, we're leaving."

"Sir!" Charlie blurted. "Perhaps you should first—"

"No." Adrian's voice was steel. "I won't fail her again."

——

Shi's Jewelry boardroom.

Stella sat buried under stacks of files.

Victor Lefèvre's mess was worse than she'd imagined.

Millions in overdue gemstone orders. Impossible contracts. A wave of resignations crippling operations.

The most urgent? Unfinished designs with looming deadlines.

Penalty clauses hung over her like a guillotine.

She worked through the night reorganizing projects. Dawn light crept in as she finally looked up.

A cold breeze slipped through the window.

She moved to close it—then froze.

A black motorcycle idled below. Its rider hunched over the seat suddenly straightened, as if sensing her gaze.

In the morning glow, his lips formed her name: "Stella."

Mr. Alistair.

Stella didn't bother with a coat as she flew downstairs.

Today, he looked younger. A black tee outlined his shoulders. Fitted jeans emphasized long legs. For a heartbeat, she saw seventeen-year-old Adrian.

"Why not come up?"

"Didn't want to alarm your mother." He opened his arms. "Also... wanted you to see me on the bike."

She melted into his embrace, inhaling faint motor oil.

"You stayed here all night?"

"Someone once gave up motorcycle racing for you." His whisper brushed her ear. "I wanted to prove I ride better."
###Chapter 181: It's Okay to Be Vulnerable With Me

The night breeze brushed past as Stella Valentine couldn't help but chuckle. "Mr. Alistair, we've been acting more and more like children lately."

"Is that such a bad thing?" His voice was unusually tender in the darkness. "When we're forced to grow up, we'll realize how rare it is to be childish."

Stella gazed into his deep eyes, her heartbeat skipping.

"I'll wait with you," she murmured. "I can't let you stand here alone in the cold."

Suddenly, he pulled her closer, his long fingers threading through her hair. "Get on."

"Now?"

"Yes."

"Where are we going?"

"It's a secret."

She glanced back at the villa. The windows were dark—her mother must already be asleep.

His arm tightened around her waist, lifting her effortlessly. In one smooth motion, he settled her onto the motorcycle's front seat before swinging his leg over and caging her against him.

He unzipped his jacket and forcibly wrapped her arms around his waist. Pressed against his firm chest, she heard his low command: "Hold tight."

The engine roared to life. The black motorcycle shot forward like an arrow.

Wind whipped past them, tangling her hair and fluttering the hem of her white floral nightgown—the one he'd picked out for her, which she'd once dismissed as too loose. Now it was her favorite.

"Stella."

The rushing wind nearly drowned out his voice.

"Mr. Alistair, I can't hear—"

She'd never seen him like this. The usually composed man was now racing through the night on his motorcycle.

As the speed increased, the scenery blurred into streaks. She squeezed her eyes shut, clinging desperately to his waist, terrified the wind might tear her away.

She felt his chest vibrate—he was saying something. But the roaring wind stole every word.

Only when the road grew rough did the bike finally slow.

Stella opened her eyes—and gasped. The wheels were inches from the cliff's edge.

She immediately shut them again, fingers twisting into his shirt.

"Still afraid of heights?" He steered with one hand, the other soothingly rubbing her back.

She nodded frantically against him.

"Feeling dizzy?"

"A... a little."

He fished something from his pocket and pressed it into her palm. The familiar shape made her pause. "Star Candy?"

"Yeah."

She popped it into her mouth. The sweetness gradually eased her fear.

When the bike finally stopped, Adrian Roland steadied her. Her face was pale, lips bitten white—only her candy-filled cheek held any color.

"Better?"

"Yes."

"Liar." He sighed, using his sleeve to wipe the tear at her eyelid. "You don't have to pretend with me."

Stella lowered her lashes. "Someone once told me that too."

"..."

"He promised to protect me forever... then forgot."

"..."

"Maybe not completely. Just mixed up who to protect." She lifted her gaze, resolve shining through. "But I don't need to rely on anyone now. I can stand on my own."

Adrian's throat moved. "Stella... do you still trust me?"

"Yes," she answered without hesitation. "But I want to be strong enough to protect myself."

His smile turned bitter. "That man who looks like me... did he make you afraid to trust completely?"

She was silent for a moment. "These six years, I lost much... but gained more. Ethan, Luna, Mom... and you. My sense of security isn't weaker—it's fuller now."

"Yet you refuse to show weakness around me."

"Because I want to be strong enough to protect those I love."

Adrian studied her before suddenly laughing softly. "How could I ever let such a bright star slip away?"

"You didn't," she whispered. "You just stopped seeing me."

The night breeze flowed between them, carrying their unspoken words.

"Mr. Alistair... can I ask you something?"

"Go ahead."

"Back then... you just watched me suffer?"

His eyes darkened. "I... wasn't fully conscious then."

"Sick? Or injured?"

"Call it an illness."

"Was it serious?"

"The doctors said... borderline."

Stella thought of Oliver. "Like that autistic boy who lost his mother? You can handle company affairs now, play with the kids... so you're healed?"

He looked toward the distant horizon. "That... I'm not sure."
###Chapter 182: A Lucky Sunrise

Stella rubbed her chilled arms. "Your health will keep improving."

"I hope so."

The mountain wind howled around them. Only then did she realize she was wearing just a thin nightgown with slippers. The earlier panic had numbed her to the cold, but now the biting chill seeped into her bones.

Darkness enveloped everything—not even streetlights pierced the blackness.

Adrian turned off the motorcycle engine, and its headlight flickered out. The world plunged into thick, impenetrable darkness.

Only the faint glow of stars and the moon illuminated the sky, casting no light on the landscape below.

"Where are we?"

"The mountaintop."

"Mountain?"

"Mount Rainier, south of Houston. Remember?"

Of course she remembered. But that only deepened her confusion. "Why bring me here in the middle of the night?"

Adrian chuckled softly. "Scared?"

"Not with you here."

"You trust me that much?"

"Who else is there to trust?"

Her words tightened something in his chest. He pulled her into his embrace. "Stella, this time I won't let anything hurt you again."

"...I've always believed in you."

"My affairs are nearly settled. Once you resolve the company matters, avenge your father, and arrange care for your mother—we'll leave this place forever. Or bring her with us."

Stella nodded faintly. "Did you find someone to take over the company?"

"Yes." His voice was low. "An elder saved me during my lowest point. Without him, I wouldn't be here. Consider the company my repayment."

"Gratitude is important."

"But after handing it over, I'll have nothing left."

She wrapped her arms around his waist. "It's fine. Once I reclaim my company, I'll take care of you."

"...Really?"

"Of course."

"Don't lie to me."

"I won't." Suddenly, she remembered something. "The wind was too loud earlier—I didn't catch what you said. Can you repeat it?"

"About my secret."

"Your origins?"

"Yes."

"Your real name?"

"Right."

Stella hesitated. "Can you tell me now?"

Before she could lift her head, he pressed it back against his chest. His amused voice tickled her ear. "I'll only say it once. If you miss it, wait for next time."

She pouted. "Fine, keep your secrets. I already know your surname is Roland, and your birthday is December 31st."

Adrian went rigid. "You know my birthday?"

Did she know?

Had she actually heard him earlier?

His blood turned to ice in his veins.

"Obviously," Stella said matter-of-factly. "You and Adrian are twins—same birthday. And... our first meeting was in Room 1231 at Houston Grand Hotel. You chose that room because it's your birthday, right?"

Adrian exhaled slowly. "Correct."

"I knew it." She laughed softly. "Julian is such a loyal friend. Joy said he refused to reveal anything about you."

"He's always been reliable."

"We should stay in touch with them after leaving."

"No." Adrian shook his head. "We'll sever all ties here once we go."

Stella frowned. "Why?"

"Some things can't be explained yet. But it's necessary—you'll understand later."

Though she trusted his judgment, Stella couldn't bear the thought of cutting off Joy. When the Valentines fell apart, Joy had stood by her unconditionally.

But reclaiming her company shares would take time. Their departure wasn't imminent.

"Stella, it's 3 AM."

"Hmm?"

Adrian pointed east. "In two hours, the sun will rise there."

Realization dawned. "You brought me here to watch the sunrise?"

"Want to?"

"Yes. I've never seen a full sunrise before. Always thought there'd be plenty of time... but kept missing it."

He wrapped his coat around her, holding her tightly. "Everything you desire will come true."

"Mr. Alistair."

"Yes?"

"You said you knew everything about me. Does that include my silly middle school diaries? Did you peek at those too?"

"...A little."

"Seriously?!"

"Mostly no. You hid that journal so well—I barely had chances." His low laugh vibrated against her. "And I found it endearing. That was the real you."

Stella's ears burned. "Wanting a puppy, planting sunflowers, watching sunrises—all those were in my diary. But I hid it better than Adrian ever could find."

"Remember where?"

"Of course—under my bed in the locked..." She caught herself. "You tricked me! I'm moving it the second we get back. Those embarrassing entries can't see daylight."

His arms tightened around her in response.

"Sleepy?"

"A bit."

"Rest then. I'll wake you at sunrise."

"You're not sleeping?"

"Not tired."

Stella mumbled, "You're made of steel."

He chuckled. "Sleep. I've got you."

Warmth seeped into her, eyelids growing heavy.

"Wake me without fail."

"Promise."

Exhaustion pulled her under swiftly.

In the haze between dreams, someone whispered her name.

"Little star..."

Her eyes fluttered open. Golden light made her squint.

At the horizon, the sun's first sliver edged into view, painting the clouds in brilliant oranges and reds.

"Mount Rainier is Houston's highest point—best for sunrises." His voice was soft at her ear. "We're lucky. Clear skies today."

The sun climbed rapidly, soon revealing more of its radiant arc.

Golden rays spilled over the city below, banishing night's chill. Warmth enveloped her, even the shadows in her heart illuminated.

"...No wonder people prefer the sun over stars."

No wonder Adrian had abandoned starlight to chase his dawn.

"But I favor the night—and the stars more."

Stella turned. "Why?"

"Darkness conceals everything—guilt, pain, vulnerability. In the black, I can be my true self. See whom I wish. Do what I must. Unhindered."
###Chapter 183: The Four-Year Promise

Dawn broke with pale light creeping across the horizon.

The rising sun slowly painted the clouds in hues of gold and crimson.

Stella Valentine tilted her head up to admire the magnificent view, her eyes shimmering faintly.

"So beautiful," she murmured softly.

Adrian Roland wrapped his arms around her from behind. "Do you like it?"

"Mmm." She leaned into his embrace. "Mr. Alistair, after we move abroad, can we still come back here to watch the sunrise?"

His arms tightened around her. "Of course."

"In four years," he suddenly added.

Stella turned to look at him. "Why four years?"

"You'll be thirty by then." His lips brushed her ear. "August twenty-sixth. We'll celebrate our birthdays together."

She laughed lightly. "What's so special about turning thirty?"

"Thirty is when one stands firm," he said seriously. "It's time to leave the past behind completely."

She nodded thoughtfully. "Four years... is enough for everything to settle."

By then, Adrian and Lily Savigny would likely be married with children, and his company would be stable.

"You promised to help me manage the company," she poked his chest playfully. "By then, I'll be your boss."

"As you wish, boss." He chuckled lowly. "But..."

"But what?"

"Four years should be enough for us to have two children." His voice held a note of anticipation. "Preferably both girls, as lovely as you."

The tips of Stella's ears turned pink. "Two?"

"Ethan and Luna need younger siblings." He rested his chin atop her head. "This time, I'll be with you every step of the way."

A pang of loneliness from her past deliveries flickered through her heart.

"Actually..." she whispered, "Adrian wasn't there for me either."

The air grew still.

Stella quickly added, "I mean... I want to have children with you too."

The last words were barely audible.

Adrian let out a quiet laugh. "No rush. We'll take our time."

His tone turned solemn. "Stella, when everything is over, I have a gift for you—one I've been preparing for six years."

"What gift?"

"A secret." He winked mysteriously. "For when you agree to marry me."

She tilted her head. "Our wedding day?"

"Yes."

"But I don't remember you promising me anything."

"I remember." His voice was soft.

Six years ago, he had purchased the naming rights to a minor planet.

It was meant to be a wedding surprise.

But fate had other plans, separating them for years.

"In four years," he vowed solemnly, "we'll bring our children here to watch the sunrise together."

......

The motorcycle screeched to a halt outside Brilliant Star Group.

"We're here." Adrian removed her helmet.

Stella checked her watch. "Almost late."

"Go on." He gave her back a gentle push. "I've got you."

She nodded. "You should leave before anyone sees you."

Watching the motorcycle disappear, Stella took a deep breath and strode confidently into the building.

"Miss Valentine, please wait." The receptionist stopped her. "Mr. Zhang said you're not allowed in today."

Stella raised an eyebrow. "Why?"

"He mentioned an important client is coming..." The receptionist twisted her fingers nervously.

Stella smiled knowingly. "Then I'll wait in the lounge."

"Would you like something to drink?"

"Iced milk, no sugar."

The receptionist hurried off, visibly relieved.

Settling on the sofa, Stella scrolled through files on her phone.

Ten minutes later, a commotion erupted in the lobby.

"Mr. Roland is here!" someone exclaimed.
###Chapter 184: The Business Gambit

"Oh my god! Mr. Roland looks absolutely devastating in that suit today!"

"Stop dreaming. He's already engaged to the Laurent heiress."

"I heard Miss Laurent is pregnant. The wedding must be soon."

"The company's cash flow is broken. If not for the Laurent family's influence, why would Mr. Roland step in to save it?"

The receptionists' cheeks flushed with excitement, even the milk delivery guy kept glancing over.

Stella Valentine followed their gaze.

Adrian Roland stood out effortlessly in his impeccably tailored black suit, his broad shoulders and narrow waist commanding attention as he strode through the lobby. His entourage of assistants faded into the background.

A decade later, this man still held the power to captivate.

"Miss Valentine, don't you think Mr. Roland is gorgeous?" The receptionist clutched her milk glass, eyes sparkling.

Stella pressed her lips together. "The most beautiful things are often the deadliest."

"What?"

"Nothing." Stella set the milk aside. "Is Mr. Roland here to discuss the investment?"

"Yes! Mrs. Durand and Miss Savigny arrived early to wait for him."

A flicker passed through Stella's eyes. "Where's the restroom?"

"Straight ahead, then turn right."

Stella thanked her and left.

She knew exactly where the restroom was.

Just as she knew the fire escape led directly to the sixteenth floor.

When she pushed open the stairwell door, Jason Macmillan stood guard outside the CEO's office.

"Miss Valentine?!" His eyes widened in shock.

"Relax." She adjusted the collar of her floral sundress. "I'm not here to make trouble."

Jason fumbled for his phone. "I'll inform Mr. Roland—"

"Don't bother." She raised a hand to stop him. "I'll announce myself."

Sophia Durand's syrupy voice drifted from inside. "Adrian, Lily made you breakfast—"

"Unnecessary." Adrian's tone was glacial. "Let's focus on business."

Sophia forced a laugh. "You know the company's situation—"

Stella leaned closer as Lily Savigny's saccharine voice chimed in. "Adrian, for our child's sake—"

"Child?" Adrian's冷笑 cut through the air. "Are you certain?"

"O-of course—"

"Hospital records show you were never pregnant." His voice dripped with disdain. "I pulled the IVF files too."

Lily's voice turned shrill. "You investigated me?"

"Considering..." Adrian drawled, "I was unconscious after being drugged that night. How exactly would there be a child?"

Stella's fists clenched outside the door.

So that was the truth.

She took a steadying breath and pushed the door open.

Three pairs of eyes snapped toward her.

Lily paled. "Stella Valentine?!"

Stella walked straight to Adrian, looking down at him. "Mr. Roland. Long time no see."

His pupils contracted.

She continued, "I'm here for business. Those gemstones are premium quality. Invest now, and I guarantee you'll double your returns."

"You?" Sophia shrieked. "Who do you think you are?"

Calmly, Stella withdrew a document from her bag. "My father's股权转让书. I'm now the majority shareholder."

Silence engulfed the room.

Adrian rose slowly, his gaze burning into her. "Terms?"

"Strictly business." She lifted her chin. "Buy the gems at market price, and we split the profits fifty-fifty."

Lily lunged forward. "Over my dead body! Adrian came to help me!"

Stella sidestepped coolly. "Miss Savigny, business runs on利益, not sentiment."

She turned back to Adrian. "Don't you agree?"

Suddenly, he smiled.

Taking the document, his fingers brushed hers deliberately. "Miss Valentine. Pleasure doing business."
###Chapter 185: Wishing You Happiness

Adrian's gaze pinned Stella like a nail.

"Money means nothing to me now."

Stella frowned slightly. "What do you mean, Mr. Roland?"

"Little Star," his voice was low, "do you truly want me to save this company?"

Sophia suddenly rushed forward. "Adrian, this company carries your parents' legacy! You and Lily are about to marry—"

"I won't marry Lily Savigny." His icy tone cut her off. "Unless she donates a lung to Stella, this company's fate means nothing to me."

Sophia paled. "You'd disregard your parents' dying wish?"

"If not for their legacy," Adrian sneered, "this company would've ceased to exist long ago."

Sophia staggered back.

"One more thing," Adrian stepped closer, "justice is coming."

"What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said." His eyes turned sharp. "My parents' car accident. Martha's death. Luna's poisoning. Ethan nearly dying—"

Sophia's lips trembled. "Evidence—"

"The evidence is complete." Adrian turned to leave.

Lily tried to follow, but Sophia snapped, "He's been investigating us all along!"

"Mom, what do we do now?"

Sophia's eyes darkened. "We take the final step."

......

In the hallway, Jason approached. "Mr. Roland."

"Let's go."

Jason glanced behind them. "Ms. Valentine is coming out."

Adrian closed his eyes wearily. "Waiting for her to curse me?"

"Felix has news."

Adrian's eyes flew open.

"Talcum powder was found in Mr. Valentine's car." Jason lowered his voice. "We've identified the brake failure cause."

Adrian clenched his fists.

Three lives destroyed by mere powder.

"Have him expedite the forensic report."

Stella's voice came from behind. "Adrian."

Jason discreetly withdrew.

"You found those two cars?" She wore a floral sundress, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders—just as he remembered.

Adrian's gaze softened.

Just wait a little longer, Little Star.

"We did," he said.

"Who helped you?"

"A very capable man."

Stella exhaled in relief. "You met with him?"

"No."

Her tense shoulders relaxed slightly.

"About Ethan and Luna—"

"Little Star," Adrian interrupted, "I won't marry Lily."

"That's your private matter."

"Can't we even be friends?"

Stella gave a bitter smile. "Not hating you doesn't mean forgiving you."

Adrian's eyes dimmed.

"If you need help with the accident investigation, just ask," she added.

"It'll all be handled." He forced a smile. "I've met someone."

Stella visibly relaxed. "Treat her well."

"Don't you want to know who?"

"It doesn't matter." Her voice was soft. "Mr. Edward Roland—"

"I'll visit the family estate this weekend." Adrian studied her. "Spend more time with the children."

"You'll have your own children someday."

"Yeah."

Silence stretched between them.

"Wishing you happiness," Stella finally said.

Adrian smiled. "You too, Little Star. Forget everything here. Live well."
###Chapter 186: The Temptress

Happiness?

Adrian Roland watched the retreating figure of the woman, his lips curving unconsciously.

Happiness was the breeze that brushed through her hair, the lingering warmth of her fingertips, the graceful arc of her skirt as she turned away.

"Boss." Jason's voice snapped him back to reality.

Only then did he realize he'd been standing there for quite some time.

"Hmm?"

"It's time for your hospital dressing change. The doctor said delaying further will leave a scar."

Adrian lightly touched the wound at his temple. The sting was sharper than yesterday.

At the hospital, the doctor frowned as he removed the bandage.

"Mr. Roland, the wound is infected and festering. You should have come last night."

"Will it scar?"

"Most likely."

"That's fine."

The doctor sighed. "This area is close to the ocular nerves. If it damages the facial nerves—"

"Will it alter my features?"

"No."

"Then it's enough." Adrian's tone was indifferent.

As the doctor cleaned the wound, he suddenly smiled. "You look much better than last time."

"I'm getting married."

"To the woman who's been haunting your thoughts?"

A softness flickered in Adrian's eyes. "The girl I've loved for ten years."

The doctor nodded knowingly. "No wonder your sleep improved after stopping the medication. Love truly is the best remedy."

"Yes..." Adrian exhaled softly.

Had he known sooner, perhaps those six years of torment wouldn't have happened.

Leaving the examination room, Jason murmured, "Everything is arranged regarding Miss Stella."

"Keep watching, especially Uncle Xavier—"

Before he could finish, the sound of a wheelchair echoed from the corridor's end.

Mr. Xavier Atlante, dressed in traditional attire, rolling walnuts in his palm, approached surrounded by his entourage.

"Adrian, how's the injury?"

"Thank you for your concern."

Mr. Xavier studied him with narrowed eyes. "Miss Stella seems to be taking good care of you."

Mr. Grant, pushing the wheelchair, chuckled. "Miss Stella is indeed remarkable. No wonder even young master Victor Valence favors her."

Mr. Xavier sneered. "Women are nothing but temptresses! They only hinder a man's ambitions!"

"Uncle Xavier!" Adrian's voice turned icy. "My aspirations lie elsewhere."

"You'd truly abandon a promising future for a woman?" Mr. Xavier's grip tightened around the walnuts. "I'll ask you one last time!"

"My answer remains unchanged."

"Fine!" Mr. Xavier laughed in fury. "If you insist on leaving, then surrender one of your hands!"

Mr. Grant smoothly interjected, "We'll see you tonight at the Oceanview Villa."

Adrian nodded calmly. "Very well."
###Chapter 187: The Greatest Fear is "What If"

Mr. Xavier Atlante had always been a cautious man.

After decades in the business world, he remained reclusive. Faces at annual summits came and went, but he remained an immovable force.

His unshakable composure was chilling.

When Adrian Roland took over New Frontier Group, he too had fought his way through this cutthroat arena. He never noticed when Mr. Atlante first set his sights on him.

Before this, he hadn’t even heard the man’s name.

Night had deepened when Adrian arrived at the coastal villa, nearing nine o'clock.

The villa stood in isolation. The road ended halfway, forcing him to continue on foot.

At the entrance, Mr. Grant had been waiting.

"You're late, Mr. Roland." Grant's smile didn’t reach his eyes. "The old man is growing impatient."

"Traffic."

"Traffic?" Grant arched a brow. "Or did you drop your son off first?"

Adrian’s gaze turned razor-sharp.

Grant raised his hands. "Just a joke. He’s in the study."

Inside, Mr. Atlante sat reading History as a Mirror, his reading glasses perched low on his nose.

"Sit," the old man said without looking up.

"No need." Adrian stood rigid. "I came to settle my debt."

Mr. Atlante chuckled. "You might not stay on your feet for long."

Adrian’s eyes landed on the newly upholstered sofa—white with delicate lavender florals, identical to Stella’s dress today.

"Lovely, isn’t it?" the old man asked.

"...Yes."

"Your taste has always been impeccable." Mr. Atlante closed the book. "Whether in clothes or people."

Adrian clenched his fists. "Leave her out of this."

"Adrian," the old man sighed, "I’m seventy-three. I don’t have time to wait. That woman’s fate means nothing to me. I only need a worthy successor."

"What I owe her can never be repaid."

"And if she discovers you’re Adrian Roland?" Mr. Atlante smirked. "Victor Valence, Hugo Merovingian—she has options. What will you have left then?"

Adrian’s jaw tightened. "I’ll be careful."

"The greatest fear is 'what if.'"

"I’ll take her far away."

Mr. Atlante shook his head. "The young never learn until it’s too late." He removed his glasses. "One last chance—"

"No." Adrian extended his hands. "Choose."

A long silence followed before the old man called, "Grant."

The man entered promptly.

"Take me to the garden." Mr. Atlante waved a hand. "At my age, I can’t stomach bloodshed."

Once the garden doors shut, Grant returned gripping a golf club.

"Recognize this?" He hefted the tungsten alloy head.

Adrian gave a humorless smile.

"The old man’s been good to you." Grant sneered. "Twenty years by his side, yet you surpassed me in six."

"People have different priorities."

"You’d abandon a steel empire for some sickly woman?" Grant thrust the club forward. "Do it yourself."

Adrian took it and swung at his left arm without hesitation.

A sickening crack echoed as blood splattered the marble table.

Grant crouched to inspect the damage, fingers brushing bone fragments.

"Brutal."

Adrian’s face was ghostly pale, sweat beading his brow. "Satisfied?"

He draped his jacket over the ruined limb. "New Frontier Group is yours. From today, Adrian Roland ceases to exist."
###Chapter 188: Storm in High Society

The night deepened as Stella Valentine tossed and turned in bed.

An inexplicable unease gripped her heart like an invisible hand.

She reached for the empty space beside her, still warm with Mr. Alistair's lingering scent. These days, she'd grown accustomed to falling asleep against his strong arm, lulled by his faint cologne.

Her fingers dialed his number, but Charlie Macmillan answered instead.

"Miss Stella, Mr. Alistair had urgent overseas business," Charlie's voice carried caution. "I'll handle Ethan's school runs. Contact me for anything."

"How long?" Her grip tightened around the phone.

A pause. "Uncertain. But he said this would be the final trip."

The word "overseas" stabbed her heart. Six years ago, Adrian Roland had taken Lily Savigny abroad, leaving Stella alone with her pregnancy.

Charlie sensed her distress. "Don't worry. This trip will resolve everything permanently. When he returns, you'll both leave Houston for good."

Dawn found Stella still staring at the ceiling.

At breakfast, Ethan listlessly pushed porridge around his bowl. The usually vibrant boy looked wilted, dark circles shadowing his eyes.

"Sweetheart, bad dreams?" Stella smoothed his hair.

He buried his face in her sweater. "Mom...I saw Daddy hurt. There was so much blood..."

Her chest constricted. "Dreams lie, baby. Daddy's the strongest superhero."

"But I don't want a superhero." Red-rimmed eyes met hers. "I just want him home safe. Eating with us. Playing games."

Her nose stung as she hugged him tighter. "He'd love hearing that."

"Then I'll tell him when he's back!"

"Yes. We'll wait together."

During the school drive, Ethan pressed against the window. "Mom, is Daddy fighting super villains?"

Stella watched passing buildings. "Maybe he's saving the galaxy. Like Iron Man."

Ethan's eyes lit up. "That's really far away!"

"Exactly. Patience, my star."

Unease permeated Brilliant Star Group's offices. Elevator whispers reached Stella's ears:

"Did Victor Lefèvre embezzle funds?"
"His wife Grace is clueless about business."
"Start job hunting—this company's finished."

Her office held a lawyer's letter—Unique Jewelry demanded repayment.

Before she could call Legal, Grace Laurent barged in with her daughter and strangers in tow.

"From today, I'm taking over." Grace slammed documents on the desk. "Victor signed these share transfers."

Stella scanned the papers. "Board approval is required per company bylaws."

"Stop bluffing!" Grace's daughter shrieked. "This bankrupt company's only hope is my fiancé Adrian Roland!"

"Certain he'll help?" Stella turned a page leisurely. "Last I heard, he's investigating a six-year-old car accident."

Grace paled. "Lies!"

Stella stood, gaze sharp as blades. "Shall we discuss who tampered with those brakes?"

Silence swallowed the room.

Grace's daughter lunged. "Slander! Adrian proved it was an accident!"

Stella sidestepped, hitting the intercom. "Security. Remove trespassers."

Alone at last, she collapsed into her chair. Trembling fingers dialed a number.

"Damian Chamberlain? Activate contingency plan Alpha immediately."
###Chapter 189: Housecleaning

The sharp click of high heels echoed through the office, silencing the workspace instantly.

I walked down the hallway without glancing sideways, heading straight for the elevator.

Only Sophia Durand waited in the CEO's office.

"Auntie, you're early." I took my seat behind the desk and powered on the computer.

She slammed her palm on the desk. "How dare you seduce Adrian Roland?"

I flipped through files without looking up. "It's too early for your hysterics."

"I'll give up the company," she hissed through clenched teeth. "Just stay away from Adrian."

A cold laugh escaped me. "Give it to me? The Valentine Group has always been mine. As for the Roland empire, that's Adrian's business. Since when do you get a say?"

"This company is jointly owned by your uncle and me!"

"Fine." I closed the file. "With eighty million in debt, you want to take on forty million? How generous of you on Uncle Victor's behalf."

"You—"

I pressed the intercom. "Security, come up for an eviction."

Sophia's face turned ashen. "You wouldn't dare! Don't forget you have two children!"

"Try me." My gaze locked onto hers. "Adrian will destroy you first. Lily Savigny will never set foot in the Roland mansion."

A knock sounded before four security officers filed in.

"Escort her out. From now on, neither she nor her daughter enters this building without my permission."

The head guard hesitated. "But Mr. Lefèvre—"

"I'll handle my uncle." My tone remained flat. "Just do your job."

Sophia shrieked, "This is outrageous! Who signs your paychecks?"

"Mr. Lefèvre left explicit instructions last night," the guard said coldly. "You're banned from the executive floor."

"Impossible!"

"Shall I retrieve the call logs?" The guard gestured toward the door. "Madam, don't make this difficult."

As they dragged her out, Sophia screeched, "Why does she get to stay?"

"Mr. Lefèvre only warned us about you."

Silence finally reclaimed the office.

Rubbing my temples, I began untangling Victor Lefèvre's mess—chaotic client records, stalled projects, a nearly broken capital chain.

Mr. Alistair was right. Sometimes destruction precedes rebirth.

Thankfully Victor was incompetent. Reclaiming the company would've been far harder otherwise.

"Ms. Valentine." The marketing manager knocked.

"Come in."

"Mr. Lefèvre scheduled a golf meeting with William Rubenstein today. Should we—"

I frowned. "What time?"

"Two o'clock."

The clock read 12:40. Zenith Industries was our biggest client, yet they'd been cozying up to competitors lately.

"What's Rubenstein's weakness?"

The manager hesitated. "You'll...understand when you see him."

Traffic clogged the mountain roads. We arrived at Rainier Golf Club twenty minutes late.

"That's Rubenstein." The manager pointed across the green.

A greasy middle-aged man groped a young woman—some influencer I vaguely recognized.

"I'll handle this." I adjusted my collar.

The manager suddenly stopped me. "Ms. Valentine, perhaps some touch-ups?"

Puzzled, I pulled out a compact.

"Something...brighter." She offered a lipstick. "Mr. Rubenstein prefers...vibrant women."

My stomach churned with understanding.

But for the company's sake, I applied the crimson shade and strode toward that repulsive figure.

Rubenstein's gaze slithered over me like a venomous snake from thirty yards away.
###Chapter 190: Unfinished Business

William Rubenstein narrowed his eyes at her. "Where's Victor Lefèvre?"

"My uncle had urgent business overseas." I straightened my posture. "Mr. Rubenstein, Unique Jewelry is fully committed to this partnership."

He scoffed. "What does a little girl like you know? Wait—did you say Victor is your uncle?"

"Yes."

"Then you must be... Felix Roland's daughter?" His gaze turned sharp.

I nodded. "You knew my father?"

"Old acquaintances." William rubbed his chin, his eyes roaming over me. "Your dad always bragged about having a smart, beautiful daughter. Never thought..." His voice trailed off suggestively.

I suppressed a shudder, noticing the hostile glare from his Instagram-model companion.

"Sweetheart, go wait in the car." William dismissed her with a wave before smiling at me. "Miss Roland, how about we discuss business over golf? If you win, I'll settle the remaining payment immediately."

"I'm afraid I don't play."

"Give it a try." He offered a club. "You might have natural talent."

"Perhaps we should talk after you've finished your game."

His expression darkened. "Are you refusing my hospitality?"

"That's not—"

"Then watch from the sidelines." He cut me off. "I sent my date away just for this meeting."

I glanced down at my professional suit and heels before reluctantly agreeing.

This outfit was chosen by Mr. Alistair. The white blouse strained against my postpartum curves. My heels sank into the grass, making me stumble several times.

William "helpfully" steadied me and handed over a water bottle. "Have some water."

I took a small sip before discreetly spitting it out when he turned away. Hot liquids aggravated my old injuries.

"I heard you were engaged to Adrian Roland?" he asked abruptly.

"That's ancient history." My grip tightened on the bottle. "You know Mr. Roland?"

"Ha!" William's face twisted with hatred. "That bastard nearly bankrupted me!"

My stomach dropped. As I stepped back, dizziness overwhelmed me. I collapsed onto the grass.

We'd wandered to an isolated area of the course.

"The drugs finally kicking in?" William shed his polite facade, leering at me. "You lasted longer than expected."

I pinched my thigh hard to stay conscious. The water! Thank God I'd spit most of it out.

"I thought Victor's wife was coming," he sneered, advancing closer. "Never imagined I'd catch Adrian's woman instead."

"We're over!" I edged backward while slipping off my heels.

"Who knows?" He loosened his tie. "Maybe he still wants you."

Seizing my chance, I smashed a stiletto into his eye.

"You bitch!" William howled in pain.

I tried crawling away but my limbs felt like lead. He yanked my hair viciously. "Should've taken the easy way!"

The sound of tearing fabric echoed across the empty fairway—
###Chapter 191: Silent Snowfall

The sound of tearing fabric pierced the mountain silence.

William Rubenstein sneered as he discarded the ripped sleeve, exposing Stella's slender pale arm.

An engine's roar approached in the distance.

A motorcycle?

Had he come?

Before William could react, an immense force yanked him off his feet. His body slammed onto the grass, tumbling several times.

"Who the hell—?" He clutched his throbbing back with a snarl.

A black-leather-clad figure stood silhouetted against the light. The helmet obscured his face but not the chilling aura radiating from him.

A golf club twirled in his grip.

"Which hand touched her?"

"None of your damn business! This woman—"

Crack!

The club smashed into William's left cheek. Blood and teeth sprayed out.

"One more time."

William spat blood, face contorted. "Do you know who I—"

Crunch!

The right side of his face caved in from a heavier blow.

"Surveillance... there are cameras outside..." William finally panicked.

A leather boot ground his face into the dirt. "Not here."

"N-name your price! Triple! Quintuple!"

The helmet came off, revealing Adrian Roland's icy features.

"Long time no see, William."

William's pupils shrank. "Adrian Roland?!"

The golf club rose again, aimed at his temple.

"Last chance."

Mountain winds howled, carrying the scent of death.

"Left hand! It was the left! Aaah—!"

His screams echoed through the valley.

Stella stumbled forward, wrapping her arms around Adrian from behind. "Enough..."

The club dropped.

Adrian turned and crushed her against his chest, his left arm hanging limp.

"Forgive me for being late."

His voice trembled.

Stella rested quietly in his embrace. "Weren't you overseas?"

"Finished early." He kissed her hair. "Let's leave this place. See the snow in Switzerland."

"But I've never seen snow..."

"You'll see it every day from now on." His tone softened. "But first, we go."

The motorcycle sped down the mountain road.

Stella noticed he steered with only one hand.

"Stop."

The moment they halted, she reached for his sleeve.

"Don't." He caught her wrist with his free hand.

"What happened to your arm?"

"Nothing."

She yanked his leather jacket open.

A gruesome wound glared back at her.

"You call this nothing?!" Her voice shook.

Adrian chuckled. "Scraped the cliff on the way here."

"This injury is days old!"

He nuzzled her nose. "Did I scare you?"

Wind scattered fallen leaves as ambulance sirens wailed in the distance.

Adrian secured his helmet again. "We'll talk at home."

The motorcycle roared to life, carrying them into the twilight.
###Chapter 192: I'll Take Care of You Forever

Stella's hands trembled.

The gruesome wound stretched across Mr. Alistair's arm, the flesh torn and horrifying to behold.

"Don't look." He covered her eyes with his other hand, his voice low.

She pushed his hand away. "Was this from the accident?"

"Yes."

"A motorcycle?"

He chuckled softly. "Nothing gets past you."

Stella's eyes burned. "Were you going fast?"

"Not too bad."

"Liar!" Her voice shook. "This kind of injury only happens at speeds over fifty miles—"

Adrian suddenly pulled her into his arms. "Don't be afraid. It's over now."

"How can it be over?" Her voice cracked. "It's still bleeding..."

"Stella." He cupped her face. "Losing you would hurt far more than this."

She bit her lower lip. "Let's go to the hospital."

"No."

"Why not?"

"My identity..."

She stamped her foot in frustration. "We can't just leave it like this!"

Adrian suddenly smiled. "You're worried about me?"

"Of course!"

"Then promise me something." He leaned close to her ear. "If this arm becomes useless, you'll take responsibility."

Stella glared at him. "How can you joke at a time like this?"

"I'm not joking." His gaze turned serious. "Stella, I have nothing left."

Her heart clenched.

"Except you." His voice softened. "You're all I have now."

Stella took a deep breath. "I'll go buy medicine."

Half an hour later, Room 1231 at the Houston Grand Hotel.

"Bear with it." Her hand shook as she held the antiseptic cotton.

Adrian leaned back on the sofa, his expression gentle. "It's fine. Do what you need to."

The moment the alcohol touched the wound, his muscles tensed, but he didn't make a sound.

Tears fell from Stella's eyes. "If it hurts, just say so."

"It doesn't." Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. "Compared to the pain of losing you, this is nothing."

She remembered that afternoon in high school.

The sunlight had been blinding on the soccer field when young Adrian fell, his leg swelling terribly.

"If I make you lame," seventeen-year-old Stella had said, "I'll take care of you."

Memory and reality overlapped.

"Mr. Alistair," she wiped her tears, "if this arm really..."

"Hmm?"

"I'll take care of you forever."

Adrian's eyes darkened. He suddenly pulled her close and kissed her.

The taste of blood lingered between them, yet the kiss was gentler than ever.

"Remember what you said." He panted against her forehead.

Stella nodded, her face flushed. "But first, let's treat your wound properly."

She bandaged him carefully, her movements clumsy but earnest.

Adrian watched her intently, as if etching this moment into his bones.

"Done." She exhaled in relief.

He flexed his arm. "Not bad."

"Liar. It's wrapped like a mummy."

"Because you did it." He smiled faintly. "So it's perfect."

Stella suddenly remembered something. "Ethan had a dream the other day..."

"About me getting hurt?"

"How did you know?"

Adrian's eyes flickered. "Father and son share a connection."

She paused but didn't press further.

Outside, dusk deepened. The room was so quiet they could hear each other's breathing.

"Stella." He spoke suddenly.

"Yes?"

"Let me say it this time." He took her hand. "If one day—"

"There are no 'ifs.'" She cut him off. "We'll both be fine."

Adrian smiled and pulled her into his arms.

The lamplight cast their intertwined shadows onto the wall, merging into one.
###Chapter 193: Do You Want the Truth?

The warmth of that memory still lingered on her cheek.

Stella Valentine would never forget the light that had flashed in Adrian Roland's eyes when he'd spoken those words. He'd shot up so fast his knee hit the table corner, yet he'd kept grinning like a child with candy. "Don't lie to me."

"...Okay."

"Little Star, if I ever make you angry, you can hit me or yell at me. Just don't lie to me."

She'd blinked in confusion. "When have I ever lied?"

"I'm scared," he'd admitted, scratching his head with that boyish awkwardness. "Scared that after chasing you for so long, it'll all be for nothing."

A mountain breeze brushed her face.

Stella snapped back to the present.

Those youthful days were long gone.

"Stella?"

"Hmm?" Her lips curved automatically.

"Is the temperature okay?"

"What?"

Mr. Alistair waved the remote. "The mountain air gets chilly."

Only then did she notice the heater humming.

"It's fine."

He sat on the bed's edge, his profile sharper than days before. The injured arm stood out starkly against his black t-shirt. Her fingers traced his forearm—cold as death. When she reached his bicep, his clenched jaw betrayed the pain.

"Does it hurt?" She reached for the first aid kit.

He shook his head. "I'm happy."

"Don't be ridiculous."

"Truly." His gaze burned. "This arm was a fair price to be with you."

As she dabbed antiseptic, she blew gently on the wound. His muscles relaxed slightly.

"It's a bad injury."

"...It's nothing."

"Was it really a motorcycle accident?"

Suddenly he gripped her wrist. "How should we decorate our future home?"

The cotton swab froze mid-air.

"Someone hit you, didn't they?" Her voice tightened. "Accidents don't just injure elbows."

"Stella..."

"You promised no lies." She cupped his face. "Yet I don't even know who hurt my man."

The dam finally broke.

"Charlie said your business is finished. Tell me everything about you now."

"...Are you sure?"

"I want the truth."

He closed his eyes. "I did this to myself."

"What?"

"Someone forbade our relationship." A bitter smile twisted his lips. "This arm repays his kindness."

Her first thought was Lily Savigny and her mother, but she dismissed it.

"The person who helped you during your illness?"

"At my lowest point with bipolar disorder," his voice roughened, "without him, I might've..."

"Might've what?"

"Gone schizophrenic. Or died."

She gasped.

"A mistake now, but he saved me then." His fingers brushed her hair. "One arm for a lifetime together? A bargain."

"Who is it?"

"After we're settled abroad."

"You can't oppose him?"

"His influence..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Beyond your imagination. We must leave quickly."

Suddenly he smiled, eyes alight. "You'll design. I'll find ordinary work. School runs, you teach art, I teach math. Bring Marshmallow too. Once healed, we'll..."

The image shimmered.

So beautiful it ached.

Money was terrifying.

For money, Lily caused a car crash. For money, Claire Florent worked herself sick. For money, Victor Lefèvre betrayed his own sister.

If only they'd been ordinary people...

"Mr. Alistair."

"Yes?"

"I'll leave with you soon."

Laugh lines crinkled his eyes. "Good."

"Still afraid?"

"Truthfully?"

"Yes."

"Terrified." His whisper cracked. "Afraid after all these years, it'll still be for nothing."

The words were a key.

Unlocking a long-buried memory.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing." She forced a smile. "Blood ties are strange."

Strange that Ethan predicted his injury.

Strange that father and son spoke identical words.
###Chapter 194: If You Leave Me

"Even the punctuation marks are identical?"

Stella Valentine bit her straw, brows furrowed. "Are all twins this uncanny?"

Joy Fairsprene lowered her voice. "I read about twin sisters who scored exactly the same on their college entrance exams—even their essays were nearly identical." She smirked. "Think they cheated?"

Stella chuckled. "Don't be ridiculous. They probably just think alike."

Joy's eyes widened as she chewed a tapioca pearl. "What if twin brothers fell for the same woman? Even a paternity test couldn't tell whose child it was!"

"You..." Stella tapped her forehead. "If they had telepathy, the older brother would've known the younger one's thoughts."

Joy suddenly straightened. "Wait! If Mr. Alistair and Adrian are twins, then your relationship with Mr. Alistair—"

Stella's fingers froze.

A lemon seed spun at the bottom of her glass.

"But Adrian doesn't know he has a brother, right?" Joy dismissed her own theory.

Stella checked her watch.

Mr. Alistair had been in pain all night, finally falling asleep at dawn. Seizing the chance, she'd met Joy at a dessert shop near the hotel.

"Joy, I want to visit Oliver."

"No work today?"

Stella shook her head.

After yesterday's confrontation with William, the deal was dead.

She was more worried about Mr. Alistair's health—she wanted to make him nourishing soup.

"Perfect timing." Joy's expression darkened. "Oliver's condition has worsened. He keeps talking to walls, scaring the other kids."

The orphanage was farther than expected.

Traffic stretched the one-hour drive into an eternity.

But today, the orphanage was eerily quiet.

"Strange. The kids should be playing outside now." Joy pulled Stella inside. "Let's find the director."

They nearly collided with the panicked director.

"Director, what's wrong?"

"Oliver... Oliver's missing!" The director trembled. "All staff are searching. Neighbors too, but..."

Stella's chest tightened. "When did you notice?"

"After nap time. The doctor said it's not autism—it's bipolar disorder. If it worsens, he might..."

Suicide.

The word chilled Stella to the bone.

Mr. Alistair had said this illness either led to schizophrenia or self-destruction.

How could a five-year-old bear such agony?

"Stella, we have to find him!" Joy stamped her foot.

Stella forced calm. "Director, have you called the police?"

"Yes, but we're too remote. It'll take time."

Her phone buzzed.

[Don't panic. I sent help.]

Mr. Alistair!

She called back instantly. He answered on the first ring.

"Mr. Alistair! Can you locate Oliver?"

"...My people are already searching."

"You don't know where he is?"

"No."

"Then how did you know I was here?"

"Half guesswork, half Charlie." His voice softened. "She never leaves your side."

No time for questions. "Mr. Alistair, Oliver has your exact condition. If... if the worst happens, where would you go?"

Silence.

"Mr. Alistair?"

"Somewhere to end the pain quickly." His voice cracked. "Pills. A car. Anything."

Stella analyzed fast. "No meds here. Few cars..."

Labored breathing filled the line.

"Mr. Alistair, are you okay?"

"Fine." Hoarse. "Just imagining if you left me—"

"Is there water nearby?" he suddenly asked.

The director gasped. "Yes! A creek to the east!"

"Go!" His voice broke. "Now!"

Joy sprinted ahead.

Stella and the director followed.

The elderly director lagged. Stella's post-surgery lungs burned with each breath.

"Oliver!"

Joy's scream pierced the air.

Stella arrived to find Joy soaked, kneeling beside Oliver's motionless body.

"Stella... he..." Joy trembled.

Stella checked for breath.

Faint.

"Call an ambulance!"

She dropped to her knees, interlacing her hands over Oliver's tiny chest.

The director wept. "Such a sin... this poor child..."

Oliver coughed violently, water spraying from his lips.

"He's alive! He's alive!"
###Chapter 195: A Fateful Reunion

Oliver's eyelashes fluttered as he slowly opened his eyes.

When he recognized Stella Valentine's face, his eyes instantly reddened. "Auntie..."

The boy was about the same age as Ethan, equally well-behaved and equally unfortunate. Hearing his hoarse voice, Stella felt as if a needle had pierced her heart.

She carefully pulled Oliver into her arms, using her sleeve to wipe his tear-streaked face. "Don't be afraid. I'm here."

Oliver's hair had grown longer, now damp and clinging to his cheeks. His freshly dried face soon became wet again—whether from river water or tears was unclear.

His pale face was frighteningly gaunt, his cheeks hollowed out since their last meeting, with dark circles under his eyes. The little boy who once waited for his mother outside the hospital had now lost even his smile.

The light in his eyes had dimmed with his mother's departure.

Stella's heart ached fiercely as she held him tighter. "Let me take you to change, okay? Wet clothes will make you sick."

Oliver's gaze drifted toward the nearby river before he suddenly buried his face in her chest like a frightened animal. "Auntie, I don't want to see anyone else..."

"Okay. Just you and me."

Only then did Oliver gradually calm down, giving a small nod in her arms.

Stella exchanged a glance with Joy Fairsprene, whose red-rimmed eyes immediately understood. She quickly led the director away to arrange a private room.

Once they were alone, Stella gently stroked the back of Oliver's head. "Are you crying?"

He shook his head. "Mom said boys have to be strong."

"It's okay to be vulnerable sometimes."

Oliver looked up, tears glistening. "Really?"

"Of course. Everyone has emotions—happiness, sadness, anger. Your mom wanted you to be strong because seeing you cry would hurt her heart. You wouldn't want that, right?"

Oliver's breathing steadied. "Auntie... I don't have a mom anymore."

"She just went to another star."

"Another star?"

"Yes. There are countless stars in the universe. She's on the brightest one. I'll show you tonight."

Oliver's eyes lit up. "Can I go find her?"

"Not yet," Stella said softly. "But one day, there will be a way."

"Then I will! I'll fly a spaceship to see Mom!"

"Great. Take me with you."

"You want to come too?"

"Yes. My dad is there as well."

Oliver's expression softened as he patted her hand. "We'll go together."

Stella smiled. "Deal."

"Auntie..." He hesitated. "Can Mom see me?"

"Of course. She's always watching over you."

Oliver lowered his head. "Then she must have been sad... seeing me jump into the river. Did Mom send you to save me?"

Stella nodded. "Yes. She was very worried."

"I'm sorry..." His voice cracked. "But I miss her so much..."

She held him close, pressing a kiss to his hair. "What Mom wants most is for you to be happy. That way, she can wait for you peacefully on her star."

"Auntie, I'm sleepy..."

Finally relaxing in her familiar embrace, exhaustion from the past days quickly pulled Oliver into sleep.

Stella gently rubbed his back. "Rest now. I've got you."

The small body in her arms gradually warmed, his breathing evening out.

"Sometimes, a kind lie is the best comfort."

Stella looked up to find Mr. Alistair standing behind her, his tall frame shielding her from the chilly wind.

Lately, he always wore black.

"When did you get here?"

"A while ago." He bent down. "Let me carry him. He's heavy."

Her arms had gone numb, but she feared waking Oliver.

Yet Mr. Alistair effortlessly took the boy with one arm, his movements surprisingly gentle.

Watching Oliver sleep soundly in his hold, Stella finally stretched her sore arms.

"Where's your car?" she asked. "You've been riding the motorcycle a lot lately."

Adrian chuckled. "Sold them all. Once you're ready here, we'll leave."

"You've changed recently."

"Have I?"

"Yes." She smiled. "You feel more real than when we first met."

"...Real?"

"Mm. Before, you seemed like an omnipotent god—always appearing when I needed help. After learning your identity, it was like... a deity stepping down from the altar, becoming someone familiar."

Adrian's smile stiffened. "Maybe it's fate."

Stella shook her head. "Not just fate. After you were injured, I realized... you remind me of someone."

"...Who?"

"Adrian Roland." Her voice softened. "Lately, I've been dreaming of our childhood. Your mannerisms, your speech—they're so much like his. The way he was before everything changed."

She paused. "That incident altered him too much. Turned someone gentle into a person full of bitterness."
###Chapter 196: She Will Live a Wonderful Life

His pupils contracted sharply. His Adam's apple bobbed. "Stella, I'm just me."

"I know."

Adrian's lips curved into a bitter smile.

Yes, she knew everything.

She knew he was Mr. Alistair. She also knew she would never forgive Adrian Roland.

So be it.

Let Adrian remain forever in that rainy night six years ago.

From now on, he would only be her Mr. Alistair, spending the rest of his life making amends and protecting her.

This was already heaven's greatest mercy.

The one who had suffered the most was always his little star.

"Mr. Alistair... when Oliver grows up and learns the truth, will he hate me?"

"What if one day you regain your memories and discover I've lied to you? Would you hate me?"

Stella tilted her head, lashes fluttering. "You mean the scar on your arm? That wasn't from a car accident. But you did it for my sake—I wouldn't blame you."

"So you'd forgive any well-intentioned lie?"

"Probably." She chuckled softly. "Depends on what it is. If it's something serious..."

"What counts as serious?"

A sudden thought made Stella's eyes crinkle like crescent moons. "Unless... you've been married before?"

"I..."

"You actually were married?"

The air froze instantly.

He had indeed been married.

To her.

Stella's smile stiffened. "Mr. Alistair, you really..."

"I promised not to lie to you."

"So?"

"Yes. But we're divorced now."

The words struck like a thunderclap.

Stella's mind went blank. Her fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her shirt.

"But you said... you've always loved me..."

"There's only ever been you."

"Then your ex-wife... was it an arranged marriage? Where is she now?"

The rapid-fire questions made Adrian's breath hitch.

"She's in Houston. She never loved me and won't return."

Stella exhaled in relief. "So it was just business."

"..."

"Is she happy now?"

"Very. She has someone who loves her and two children."

Finally, Stella smiled. "That's good. She was a victim too."

"She suffered greatly."

"As long as she's happy now." Her voice softened. "Don't blame yourself, Mr. Alistair."

Adrian's gaze burned. "She'll always be happy."

"You really scared me though." Stella stuck out her tongue playfully.

"Does it bother you?"

"A little." She blinked. "But I was married before too, and have a child. If anything, you got the short end of the stick."

Tenderness warmed Adrian's eyes. "I'm the lucky one."

When they returned to the orphanage, the director had prepared their rooms.

Joy gasped when she saw Mr. Alistair, covering her mouth. "Good heavens! The resemblance is uncanny! They could be twins!"

Stella laughed. "You'll notice the differences after spending time together. Listen—their voices aren't the same."

Nearby, Adrian carried Oliver inside.

Joy perked her ears. "You're right! Mr. Alistair's voice is deeper."

"Mhm."

"And their auras are completely different. Mr. Alistair radiates integrity."

Stella barely suppressed another laugh. "Are we in a drama now?"

"I'm serious!" Joy lowered her voice. "Adrian always felt brooding, but Mr. Alistair seems at peace. It's comforting."

Stella grew thoughtful.

"Oh! I invited the best psychiatrist—he should arrive soon."

As if on cue, a black sedan pulled up outside.

A middle-aged man in a white coat approached with a medical bag.

Joy hurried forward. "Dr. Lowell?"

"Miss Fairsprene?"

"The child is inside. He nearly jumped into the river today!"

The doctor's expression darkened. "Bipolar disorder requires immediate intervention."

"Is he suicidal?"

"Without treatment, the consequences could be severe."

Joy's eyes reddened. "Please save him!"

The three rushed inside.

Oliver sat motionless on the bed, gaze vacant.

Adrian was murmuring reassurances.

As he stood, he nearly collided with the entering Joy.

"Careful."

His hand steadied her.

When he looked up, he locked eyes with the doctor.

Both froze.

"You're... Adr—"

Adrian cut him off. "Doctor, the child's condition is unstable."

The doctor studied him suspiciously before turning to Oliver.

Adrian seized the chance to exit.

Dr. Jonathan Lowell...

He knew that man all too well.
###Chapter 197: Making Peace with Oneself

Dr. Jonathan Lowell studied Oliver Florent for a long moment. As a psychology expert, he noticed something significant but maintained a professional smile. "Alright."

The therapy required absolute privacy. The headmaster and teachers tactfully stepped out.

Joy Fairsprene clung to the doorframe, unwilling to leave. Stella Valentine gently tugged her sleeve. "Give him space. He's wary of the outside world right now. The doctor needs him completely relaxed for an accurate diagnosis."

Joy cast one last reluctant glance before finally following Stella down the hallway.

"Stella, I have an idea."

"You want to adopt him?"

"I consulted a lawyer. Even if I got married, I wouldn’t meet the adoption requirements." Joy bit her lip. "I was thinking—how can his father just walk away? His own son is this sick, and he acts like nothing’s wrong?"

Stella was silent for a moment. "It’s unfair."

"Just like how Adrian Roland ignored Ethan when you had to beg him for another child to save him. Fathers get to live carefree while mothers suffer. Does that make sense?"

Stella gave a bitter smile. "That’s in the past."

"I’m just reflecting. You have Mr. Alistair now, who adores you. Ethan is so mature, and little Luna is precious. They’re twins, yet Mr. Alistair is kind and gentle while Adrian is heartless. How can they be so different?"

"Maybe because Adrian witnessed his parents’ deaths. The hatred consumed him. Mr. Alistair lived alone and saw the truth clearly."

Joy suddenly gripped her hand. "Stella, you’re lucky to have him. But Oliver’s mother will never come back. It terrifies me—what if Mr. Alistair hadn’t shown up? Would Ethan have—"

Around the corner, Adrian’s grip tightened around his water bottle.

"No." Stella’s voice was soft but firm. "Mr. Alistair would have come."

The session lasted until dusk.

When Dr. Lowell emerged, the headmaster rushed forward. "Doctor—"

Joy pulled Stella along quickly.

The doctor’s expression was grave. "Someone should stay with the boy. Let’s talk elsewhere."

The headmaster hesitated.

"I’ll do it." Adrian’s voice came from behind. "I can take care of him."

Dr. Lowell met his gaze, and the two exchanged a silent nod.

In the headmaster’s office, the doctor opened his notebook. "The situation is severe. His mother’s death devastated him, compounded by his other condition. Does anyone know the details?"

The headmaster shook his head.

"He has a liver condition," Stella said quietly. "It’s hereditary. His mother worked herself to death trying to pay for his treatment."

"Oh God..." The headmaster covered her mouth.

Dr. Lowell wasn’t surprised. "Bipolar disorder, severe depression with suicidal tendencies. I’ll prescribe medication, but he needs patient guidance."

The headmaster nodded repeatedly.

"But the bigger issue..." The doctor hesitated. "He’s developed a second personality."

The room fell silent.

Joy gasped. "Isn’t that only in novels?"

"It’s a real psychological defense mechanism," Dr. Lowell explained. "Extreme cases can have over 300 personalities. Oliver’s is different—his alter is himself from two months ago, when his mother was still alive."

Shock rippled through the room.

Joy whispered, "If he could stay like that forever..."

"Theoretically, that would be ideal. If the personality matures before facing reality, the pain lessens. But we can’t control the switches. It’s up to chance."

The flicker of hope dimmed.

"However..." The doctor added, "I had a similar case. The patient also developed a second personality after trauma—reverting to a time before the incident."

Stella leaned forward. "How is he now?"

"He stopped coming for follow-ups. At our last session, his primary personality had returned, but he’d accepted all memories and made peace with his past."

He paused. "That’s the best outcome. But if he loses someone dear again... it’ll be worse than Oliver’s case."
###Chapter 198: I Like Her Too

Children's laughter echoed through the orphanage hallway.

Most of the kids here were under twelve. The director always tried her best to secure schooling opportunities or find adoptive families for the older children. Only the youngest remained under her personal care.

When Stella Valentine pushed open the door, sunlight slanted across the pillow with a Captain America shield pattern. Little Oliver sat on the edge of the bed, clutching an Iron Man action figure.

"Auntie!" Oliver's eyes lit up as he jumped down.

Adrian Roland sat beside him, watching the lively boy with gentle eyes. Just hours ago, this child had been lying soaked on the riverbank.

"Uncle played with me for so long." Oliver tilted his head suddenly. "Auntie, is this handsome uncle your boyfriend?"

Stella's face flushed instantly.

Adrian ruffled Oliver's hair. "What do you think?"

"I think not." Oliver declared firmly. "Because I saw Uncle at the airport days ago with another auntie."

The air in the room froze.

Stella's fingers twisted unconsciously. She knew exactly who Oliver meant.

"That auntie pushed me and said I hit her with a ball." Oliver pouted. "I don't like her."

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "Uncle doesn't like her anymore either."

"Really?" Oliver's eyes sparkled. "Then you can be with Auntie Stella now!"

Stella couldn't help laughing. "Oliver, adult relationships are complicated."

"Not complicated at all." Hugging his Iron Man, Oliver said seriously, "Good people should be with good people. Auntie Stella paid me to sing, and Uncle just played with me. You're both good."

Suddenly Adrian knelt on one knee to meet Oliver's gaze. "Oliver, I'll tell you a secret."

"What secret?"

"Uncle likes Auntie Stella too."

Oliver giggled and buried his face in the blanket. "So embarrassing!"

Standing nearby, Stella felt her cheeks burn. She watched Adrian tuck Oliver in gently, murmuring until the boy fell asleep.

Only when Oliver's breathing steadied did Adrian rise and pull Stella into his arms.

"You heard that?" His voice was rough.

"Yes."

"I meant it." His arms tightened. "Stella, I can't lose you again."

She rested against his chest, listening to his steady heartbeat. "I know."

"You don't." Adrian's chin pressed against her hair. "Every time I see Oliver, it's like seeing my younger self. So small. So helpless..."

"He has you now." Stella patted his back softly. "Dr. Lowell said his condition is special—the alternate personality takes him back to when his mother was alive."

Abruptly Adrian released her, cradling her face. "Promise me you'll never leave."

"Why suddenly—"

"Psychological defenses don't last forever." His voice trembled. "If it happened again, I'd truly lose my mind."

Stella gazed into his reddened eyes and nodded. "I promise."

Outside, the setting sun stretched their intertwined shadows long across the floor. In bed, Oliver turned over, a sweet smile lingering on his lips.
###Chapter 199: I'm Taking This Seriously

"Again?" Stella Valentine frowned slightly. "Mr. Alistair, have you experienced something similar to Oliver before?"

Adrian Roland nodded, then smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry. I've fully recovered."

Following Dr. Jonathan Lowell's recommendation, the orphanage director finally agreed to let Joy Fairsprene temporarily foster Oliver. The chaotic environment wasn't ideal—the boy needed a safer space to grow.

"Auntie, where's my mom?" Oliver asked with innocent eyes.

Joy's eyes were still red-rimmed, but she beamed. "She went abroad for work. The pay is better and the job's easier there."

"Why didn't she take me?"

"Because..." Joy blinked playfully. "Flying stunts kids' growth!"

Her natural cheerfulness soon had Oliver giggling. As they left, Joy suddenly turned back, studying Adrian intently. "The resemblance... it's uncanny."

Adrian cleared his throat awkwardly.

"Don't worry, Stella," Joy patted her chest. "Oliver's in good hands with me."

Stella felt reassured. Joy had always been wholehearted with children. More importantly, with Oliver in her care, Joy would stay away from that suspicious Harry Vance.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Mr. Roland, the lawsuit materials against Sophia Durand and her daughter are ready. We can file anytime."

"Let legal handle it." Adrian's voice was low.

"The will is also drafted per your instructions—shares transferred to Mr. Xavier Atlante, vehicle liquidation funds deposited into Ms. Valentine's European account."

"Amount?"

"Seven figures."

"Sufficient."

"Tomorrow's the weekend. Ms. Valentine plans to take the children to the ancestral home."

"Understood. Expedite the lawsuit. I want no complications."

Hanging up, Adrian returned to Stella. She was conversing with Dr. Lowell, who tactfully excused himself. "Oliver will recover, just like my former patient did."

Watching the doctor leave, Stella slipped her arm through Adrian's. "Let's go home."

But the motorcycle headed toward the amusement park.

"Why here?" Stella gazed at the neon-lit entrance.

"The Ferris Wheel." His eyes mirrored the starlight. "To see the stars from the highest point."

Stella's heart fluttered. "That was my twentieth birthday wish."

"Great minds think alike." He laced their fingers together. "Before leaving Houston, tell me all your unfulfilled wishes."

As the wheel ascended, city lights scattered below like fallen stars.

"The night sky looked this beautiful six years ago too." She leaned against the glass. "I always envied the sun for warming hearts. Stars may shine, but few stop to admire them."

Adrian's heart twisted. He'd mistaken false sunlight for warmth, overlooking the brightest constellation beside him.

"Stella." He suddenly knelt on one knee. "Marry me."

Her cheeks flushed. "You... planned this?"

"No. The sky's too breathtaking not to act." His gaze burned. "Ask anything, and it's yours."

Her eyes sparkled mischievously. "Then... where's my star?"

"I've purchased a minor planet. It'll bear your name."

Stella's eyes widened. "Truly?"

"Absolutely." He clasped her hand. "So, yes?"

She grinned slyly. "My twentieth birthday list had two unchecked items. One was buying Dad a new car..."

"And the other?"

"Seeing snow in Houston." She winked. "Can the infallible Mr. Alistair manage that?"

"If I make it snow here, you'll marry me?"

"Deal."

"Then it's settled." His gaze turned resolute. "I'm taking this seriously."

"I was just—"

"No take-backs." He kissed her knuckles. "My bride."
###Chapter 200: Silent Snowfall

Snow was a rarity in Houston. Historical records showed only three instances of snowfall in this region, the most recent being during the Kangxi era.

Stella Valentine stared at her phone screen, fingers trembling slightly. She never expected her casually written wish list would become the biggest obstacle.

"Miss Valentine, here are the latest client files." The manager placed the documents gently before her.

"Any news about my uncle?"

The manager hesitated. "Mr. Lefèvre... hosted a yacht party in the Mediterranean. He even chartered a plane for several actresses."

Stella's head snapped up. "When?"

"Yesterday. Morale is plummeting—one-third of employees have already resigned." He handed her a stack of forms. "Worse, our cash flow has dried up. We can't even cover this month's payroll."

Her grip tightened around the pen. Her father's painstakingly built company was being ruined by her uncle.

Her phone vibrated. A text from Mr. Alistair appeared:
[Begin the buyout. Wait and observe.]

"I understand." She gestured for the manager to leave.

But he pulled an envelope from his pocket. "Miss Valentine, I..."

Her chest constricted at the resignation letter. Even this loyal employee, who had served her father for twenty years, couldn't hold on any longer.

"Collect a year's salary from accounting." Her voice grew hoarse as she signed. "You're always welcome back."

The manager's eyes reddened. "Your signature... it looks just like Mr. Valentine's."

Silence reclaimed the office. Gazing at the gathering clouds outside, Stella imagined her father's disappointed expression.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Does it hurt?" Mr. Alistair's voice carried through the receiver. "Victor is dumping his shares."

She straightened instantly. "He's desperate?"

"I opened a European account for you. Enough to buy all his holdings." A pause. "With your existing 25%, you'll regain control."

Her breath hitched. "How much... is in the account?"

"Seven figures. Time was short—"

"It's enough!" Her voice shook. "Mr. Alistair, I..."

"Focus on the task." He interrupted gently. "The password is sent. Move quickly."

When the login screen appeared, Stella gasped—the balance displayed seven figures in euros.

Stock charts bled red. Brilliant Star Group's shares had plummeted from $60 to $13, still falling.

Victor's entire stake appeared for sale. Without hesitation, she clicked "Buy." Her fingers trembled upon confirming the trade.

As the transaction completed, Stella covered her mouth. Tears spilled over.

Six years. Her father's empire had finally come home.

The phone rang again. Her mother's panicked voice: "Stella! The police took your aunt and cousin! They're suspects in a murder case..."

Clutching the phone, she watched the darkening sky outside.

A storm was coming.
###Chapter 201: Stop Waiting, He Won't Come

Stella Valentine leaned back in her office chair and slowly closed her eyes.

This long, exhausting battle was finally coming to an end.

She should have seen it sooner.

Mr. Alistair's recent strange behavior—taking her on the Ferris wheel, proposing under the stars, desperately fulfilling her twenty-year-old wish list.

And that injured arm he refused to explain.

"Stella?"

Her mother's worried voice came through the phone.

"I'm listening, Mom." Stella opened her eyes, fingertips lightly tapping the desk. "I will clear Dad's name."

Grace Laurent's voice trembled. "When this is over, let's leave this place. This house... it's filled with memories of your father."

"Okay."

"About the company—"

"Someone will handle it." Stella cut her off, her gaze landing on the date on her computer screen. A sudden realization struck her. "Is today the weekend?"

"Yes. Weren't you supposed to take the kids to visit Grandpa Edward?" Grace hesitated. "No matter what happened between you and Adrian, the children need their father."

Stella hung up and organized her files.

As she stepped out of the company, a black Lincoln limousine silently pulled up in front of her.

The window rolled down, revealing Mr. Grant's smirk. "Miss Valentine, what a coincidence."

Stella took half a step back, her fingers subtly reaching for her phone in her bag.

"Relax." Mr. Grant removed his sunglasses. "I just want to discuss the final payment for those gemstones."

"I'll transfer it soon—"

"The money isn't important." His voice suddenly dropped. "What matters is... I know your Mr. Alistair's secret."

Stella's pupils constricted.

"Get in." Mr. Grant gestured invitingly. "Unless you don't want to know his true identity."

Four bodyguards in black silently surrounded her.

The car's interior was surprisingly spacious. The facing seats reminded Stella of scenes from crime movies.

Mr. Grant cradled a ball of white fluff in his arms.

"Your dog is adorable." He scratched the puppy's chin. "Luna is quite charming too."

"What did you do to my daughter?" Stella's voice shook.

"Don't worry. She's on her way to the Roland residence." He chuckled. "Speaking of which, your Mr. Alistair has sacrificed far more for you than you realize."

He leaned closer, whispering, "Power, status, his arm... even his life."

Stella's head snapped up.

"Stop waiting." Mr. Grant reclined, pity in his eyes. "He won't come."
###Chapter 202: Survival of the Fittest

Stella Valentine's fingers curled slightly.

"I don't understand."

"He sheltered you too well." Mr. Grant chuckled. "Let me tell you a story."

Stella remained silent.

"Once there was a prodigy who fell in love with a girl," Mr. Grant began. "A tragedy shattered him. He nearly took his own life. Then someone saved him."

Her pulse quickened.

"This benefactor recognized his talent and invested everything in him. He thrived beyond expectations." His tone darkened. "Until he met you."

Stella's head snapped up.

"He abandoned everything for you." Ice laced Mr. Grant's words. "The man who gave him a second life was betrayed for love."

Her grip tightened on her dress.

"He became two people." His gaze pinned her. "One accepted the benefactor's terms. The other still secretly protects you."

Dizziness washed over her.

The fragmented pieces connected—Mr. Alistair's bipolar disorder, his suicidal tendencies, the truth behind his severed arm.

"You're here to make me leave?" Her voice trembled.

"Clever." He nodded. "The benefactor won't force you. But he won't lose his heir."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Mr. Alistair refused, so you came to me?"

Mr. Grant's eyes narrowed. "Resistance is futile against absolute power."

The car halted at the school gates.

"You have your son. Your family. Your friends." His words carried warning. "Losing him won't destroy you. But if he chooses you, he loses everything."

A chill crept through her bones. "Is that a threat?"

"Merely facts." He pushed the door open. "The benefactor says he saved Mr. Alistair once. He can break him just as easily."

Stella stumbled onto the sidewalk.

The Lincoln sped away.

Her phone buzzed violently—thirty missed calls flashed onscreen.

"Stella!" Mr. Alistair's frantic voice crackled through. "Where are you?"

"School gates." She swallowed. "My phone malfunctioned."

"I'll replace it immediately." Relief bled through. "Did you get Ethan?"

"Soon." She bit her lip. "Mr. Alistair... where are you?"

"Handling business. Home by evening." Warmth returned to his tone. "The company is ours again. Once the accident trial concludes, we'll marry in Europe."

Her eyes burned.

"Mommy!" Ethan barreled into her arms.

She hugged him through the ache in her chest. "Missed me?"

"Lots!" He beamed up. "Are we visiting Great-grandpa today?"

"Yes."

"Is Luna there too?"

Stella hesitated. "She's waiting for us."

"Did Daddy take her?"

Her throat tightened. Adrian hadn't asked about the children in weeks.

Taking Ethan's hand, she whispered, "Let's not keep your sister waiting."
###Chapter 203: There's Truly No Future for Us

Stella Valentine stood before the Roland family estate, sunlight casting shadows across her pale face.

Ethan clutched her hand tightly. "Mom, is Dad really not coming?"

She knelt to straighten his collar. "Dad's busy with work. Great-grandpa will play with you today."

The estate gates creaked open.

Edward Roland hurried forward with his cane, silver beard trembling in the breeze. "Little Star!"

"Grandpa Edward." Stella forced a smile.

"Great-grandpa!" Ethan cheered, launching himself into the old man's arms.

Edward lifted his grandson but stumbled. Stella rushed to steady him. "Be careful."

"Nothing to worry about." The old man's eyes crinkled with laughter. "I'll always be strong enough to hold my great-grandson."

Benjamin Langley approached carrying Luna. "The young master still isn't answering his phone."

"That ungrateful brat!" Edward's cane struck the ground. "Abandoning his own children now?"

Stella's gaze locked onto Luna in Benjamin's arms. Her pupils contracted.

"Who brought Luna here?"

Benjamin looked startled. "Wasn't it your assistant? They said you were running late—"

Ice flooded Stella's fingertips. She'd sent no one.

The suited man who delivered Luna must have been sent by Mr. Grant. This was a warning.

The parlor overflowed with new toys—slides, rocking horses, plush animals. Ethan whooped and dashed inside.

"The master emptied an entire toy store," Benjamin chuckled.

Edward's expression softened. "Roland heirs deserve only the finest."

Benjamin redialed. "The young master's phone is off."

"Don't bother." Stella's voice was featherlight. "The children came to see you."

"Nonsense!" Edward's grip tightened on his cane. "Children need their father!"

Ethan rode a rocking horse toward them. "We have a dad! Our new dad's awesome!"

Silence swallowed the room.

Edward's face drained of color. "What new dad?"

"You know..." Ethan tilted his head. "Not the dad from before."

Stella didn't intervene. The truth needed to surface.

"Grandpa Edward, Adrian and I are over. He's getting married soon. So am I."

"Impossible!" The old man seized her wrist, trembling. "You two were destined!"

Ethan hugged his great-grandfather's leg. "New dad's a superhero! He gave me Iron Man!"

Edward's eyes reddened. "Those are Roland children..."

"They'll always be your great-grandchildren." Stella's tone remained gentle but unyielding. "But between Adrian and me... there's truly no future."

Footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Adrian Roland appeared in the doorway, his complexion ashen. "Grandfather. I'm here."
###Chapter 204: My Reasons

"You finally decided to come back?!" Old Mr. Roland's eyes blazed with fury as his cane struck the floor with a resounding crack. "A dozen calls went unanswered. Do you even consider this your home anymore?"

A teacup whizzed past Adrian's temple, shattering against the wall in a burst of brown liquid. Blood trickled down his forehead, yet his expression remained unflinching.

"Grandfather looks well." He wiped the blood away casually, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Seems you've been thriving in my absence."

"Thriving my foot!" The old man's beard quivered with rage. "Look at Luna—she doesn't even recognize her own father now!"

Benjamin stepped forward, cradling the porcelain-skinned little girl. "Young Master, Luna just learned to say 'Daddy'..."

Adrian retreated half a step. "My hands are full. It's not convenient."

"Your left hand is empty!" Mr. Roland slammed the table and rose to his feet. "You won't even hold your own daughter? Are you even fit to be a father?"

"I'll be leaving soon." Adrian set down the gift box in his hands. "These are for you. I... may not have many chances to visit in the future."

"What do you mean?" The old man's face darkened instantly. "Are you abandoning this family?"

"Stella will take good care of the children. I trust her."

"You disgrace!" Mr. Roland swung his cane with full force. "How dare you mention Stella after all this?"

The cane struck Adrian's left arm with a sickening thud. He staggered, sweat soaking through his shirt, but not a sound escaped him.

Luna burst into terrified sobs, burying her face in Stella's chest. Ethan clutched his mother's sleeve, whispering to his sister, "Don't be scared. I'm here."

Stella gathered both children in her arms. "Mr. Roland, we should go."

"Stay right there!" the old man thundered. "We're settling this today!"

Adrian closed his eyes briefly. "I'm getting married."

"You wouldn't dare!"

"I've waited six years for this." His voice was soft but unyielding. "I won't miss my chance again."

Mr. Roland trembled with fury. "Get out! From this day forward, I have no grandson!"

Luna's wails pierced the air. Benjamin quickly ushered Stella toward the door. "Stella, take the children home first."

Glancing at the grandfather and grandson locked in their standoff, Stella murmured, "I'm planning to move abroad with the kids."

Benjamin's eyes reddened. "This new father... is he dependable?"

"He's good to us." She offered a small smile. "Take care of yourself and Mr. Roland."

Outside, Charlie already had the car ready. He adjusted the child seats efficiently. "Mr. Alistair asked me to drive you home."

As the car pulled away from the estate, Stella watched the shrinking mansion in the rearview mirror. "He's not coming back tonight?"

"He said he has one last important matter to handle."

"Mr. Grant visited me today." Stella's grip tightened around Luna. "He knows about Rose Garden."

Charlie slammed the brakes. "What?!"

"He was the one who sent Luna to me." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "He said I ruined Mr. Alistair's future."

"Don't listen to him!" Charlie's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "He'll be free soon..."

A distant rumble of thunder rolled across the sky. The storm was coming.
###Chapter 205: The Most Precious Time

The hospital corridor lights glared harshly.

Dr. Jonathan Lowell adjusted his reading glasses and held the X-ray up to the lightbox. "I knew you'd come eventually."

Adrian Roland sat on the examination chair, his knuckles white. "Had to come at this hour. Too noticeable during the day."

"Afraid of running into Ms. Valentine?" Dr. Lowell smiled knowingly. "That secret of yours really can't see the light of day."

"..."

The X-ray slid back into the manila envelope with a soft rustle.

"Brain scans show no organic lesions." Dr. Lowell removed his glasses and rubbed his temples. "Your condition is dissociative identity disorder triggered by PTSD. Still taking your meds?"

"Missed a few days." He pointed to the bandage on his temple. "Switched medications after the injury."

Dr. Lowell's expression darkened. "Antidepressants and mood stabilizers must be taken continuously! Do you remember what happened during your last episode?"

Memories flooded back.

That night after losing control with Stella, he'd nearly shattered. Hatred and desire had torn at his soul until holding her close finally patched the void in his heart.

"I remember." His voice was hoarse. "Acted like a madman."

"Madman is an understatement." Dr. Lowell sighed. "Your eyes were so bloodshot I thought they'd burst. Had to give you double the sedative dose."

Silence engulfed the examination room.

"You said you hurt the person you love most." The old doctor's gaze sharpened. "Still hurting her now?"

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "Every day."

"Memory lapses?"

"Happening more often."

Dr. Lowell's face grew grave. "That means it's worsening. Mr. Roland, you know better than anyone how rare second chances are."

Outside the window, neon lights cast fractured reflections on the glass.

"I need to know," Adrian suddenly looked up, "can this personality disappear?"

"DID is like walking a tightrope." Dr. Lowell interlaced his fingers. "You might reintegrate with the host personality, develop new alters, or even..."

"Forget everything now?"

"Like a hard drive losing power."

Adrian's fists clenched, knuckles bleaching white.

"But that day at the orphanage," the doctor's tone shifted, "Ms. Valentine shielded your left arm with her body. She was protecting you, even subconsciously."

The corner of his mouth lifted involuntarily.

"In high school when I got injured during soccer, she spread her arms in front of me like a bristling kitten." The memory softened his gaze. "Ready to scratch anyone who came near."

Dr. Lowell chuckled. "Childhood sweethearts?"

"She was...the most precious time of my life." His voice caught.

"But you can make new memories." The pen scratched across the prescription pad. "As new people."

Adrian took a deep breath. "I'll need the medication list. Leaving the country soon."

"After the lawsuit?"

"Yeah."

The doctor wrote the final line. "Have someone pick it up tomorrow. But—" He suddenly winked. "As your physician, I sincerely hope we never meet again."

The night wind carried the sting of antiseptic.

His motorcycle waited silently under the trees, its black frame melting into the darkness.

His phone vibrated.

"Boss, Ms. Valentine and the kids are home safe." Charlie sounded exhausted. "But the old man is furious."

"I'll explain once things settle." He massaged his temples. "Take care of Grandfather for me."

A pause. "You sure you don't want me to come?"

"Jason's staying to manage Shi's Group." Adrian hesitated. "I trust you to handle things here."

"One more thing!" Charlie's voice dropped. "Grant knows about Rose Garden. His men delivered Luna to the estate today!"

Ice crawled down his spine.

"Not a coincidence." His voice turned glacial. "That's a warning."

Rustling came from the bushes.

A figure emerged slowly in the moonlight.
###Chapter 206: Kneel and Beg Me

Adrian Roland's voice turned icy when he recognized the approaching figure. "Stay downstairs tonight. Don't move an inch."

He hung up before Charlie Macmillan could respond.

Grant Rubenstein leaned against the wall, his smile dripping with mockery. "How touching, Mr. Roland. Throwing away your future for a dying woman?"

Adrian straightened, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Why is Mr. Xavier's lapdog following me instead of wagging its tail for its master?"

"True, I've been his dog for over a decade." Grant's grin twisted. "Yet the old man would rather hand everything to an outsider like you than acknowledge me."

"What do you want?"

"I can help you escape." Grant lowered his voice. "Mr. Xavier's men are already heading to Rosewood Gardens. How long do you think Charlie can hold them off alone?"

Adrian's pupils contracted. "He sent people there?"

"Correct." Grant spread his hands. "Pity your wife shares your stubbornness. My persuasion failed."

Adrian seized his collar, lifting him off the ground. "What did you say to her?"

"Exactly what the old man ordered—you can guess, can't you?" Grant's smirk turned sinister. "Now your wife and children are in his hands."

Adrian shoved him away and swung onto his motorcycle.

Grant's laughter chased after him. "By the time you get back, you'll only be collecting Stella's corpse."

The handlebars creaked under Adrian's grip. His voice was raw. "Name your terms."

"Kneel." Grant adjusted his collar. "I want you on your knees, begging for forgiveness."

Raindrops began falling between them.

"Why should I?"

"Because I hold their lives in my hands." Grant pulled out his phone. "Three seconds. Kneel or I make the call."

"Three—"

The dial tone pierced the rainy night.

"Two—"

"Mr. Rubenstein?" A voice answered.

"One—"

"I'll kneel!" Adrian's eyes burned crimson. "Swear they'll be safe."

Grant licked his lips eagerly. "Of course. The old man's slipping. I know how to work around him."

He aimed his camera at Adrian. "Hurry. Stella hates thunderstorms."

Thunder roared as the rain intensified.

Adrian glanced at the ink-black sky before slowly bending his knees.

With a heavy splash, he crashed onto the wet pavement.

"Beg!" Grant barked.

"...Please." Adrian's voice scraped like gravel.

"Louder. Who's begging whom?"

"Adrian Roland... pleads with you to spare them."

Grant suddenly kicked his injured left arm. Blood soaked through Adrian's sleeve instantly. "Not enough! Kowtow!"

Agony sent Adrian collapsing into the rainwater. Gritting his teeth, he pushed himself up and pressed his forehead to the cold ground. "I, Adrian Roland... beg you... let them go..."

Grant's maniacal laughter merged with the thunder.

Meanwhile, at Rosewood Gardens...

Little Luna wailed at each thunderclap while Ethan trembled in Stella's arms. "Mommy, I dreamed Daddy was covered in blood..."

Stella tightened her embrace, gazing at the storm-lashed night. A sudden, sharp pain pierced her heart.
###Chapter 207: The Warmth of Home

The sound of a turning key pierced the quiet night.

Stella Valentine sat up abruptly, instinctively shielding her two children behind her. "Who's there?"

A tall silhouette emerged in the dim hallway light.

"Mr. Alistair?"

His deep voice carried unexpected tenderness. "Still awake?"

"Daddy!" Ethan cheered, leaping off the bed barefoot to crash into his arms. "I missed you so much!"

The five-year-old boy collided with Adrian Roland like a tiny cannonball, nearly knocking him off balance.

"Daddy's all wet." Ethan wrinkled his nose, tiny fingers brushing the soaked fabric. "I'll get a towel!"

His little footsteps pattered toward the bathroom.

In Adrian's arms, Luna Roland stopped crying, blinking teary eyes at her father with curiosity.

Stella approached, her fingertips grazing his chilled clothing. "You're drenched! Your wounds could get infected! Where's Charlie? Do you have any idea how worried—"

Her scolding died when his forehead dropped onto her shoulder.

She'd never seen him like this before.

Streetlight through the window illuminated his exhausted face—a battle-scarred lion.

Yet he still pressed a gentle kiss to Luna's cheek, making her giggle.

"Daddy! Towel!" Ethan returned triumphantly with a bath towel, his expression serious. "Dry off or you'll catch cold."

Adrian knelt, kissing his son's forehead as he accepted it. "Thank you."

"Did you beat the bad guys today?" Ethan tilted his head.

Adrian's smile faltered. "Daddy... lost."

Ethan suddenly grasped his large hand. "That's okay! You'll always be my superhero!"

"But today... I lost badly."

The child reached up to touch his face. "Are you hurt?"

"Are you disappointed in me?"

"Never!" Ethan shook his head fiercely. "Teacher says failure is the mother of success! You're the best!"

Adrian's eyes reddened. "I haven't been... a good father before."

"Liar!" Ethan buried himself in Adrian's embrace. "You're the greatest daddy ever!"

Watching them, Stella felt her nose sting.

"Let Daddy shower first," she murmured.

Ethan suddenly grinned mischievously. "Mommy should help him! I want a baby brother!"

Stella's face burned crimson.

What nonsense had Joy been teaching him?

"Stella?" Adrian's gaze turned scorching.

Flustered, she settled Luna down before being half-guided into the bathroom by his arm.

In the cramped space, his breath warmed her ear.

"Your... your injuries..." she stammered.

He chuckled low. "Just showering. What were you thinking?"

"I wasn't!"

"Then why so red?"

She shoved him in embarrassment, only to hear a pained gasp.

"Did I hurt you?" She rushed forward.

The next instant, she was pulled into a damp embrace.

"Still so easy to fool." His arms tightened around her with a laugh.
###Chapter 208: It's All Over

Stella Valentine pushed him away abruptly, her eyes reddening. "You lied to me?"

Adrian Roland chuckled softly, pulling her back into his embrace. "Just a little bump. It's nothing."

Her fingers trembled as they brushed against his sleeve. "Does it hurt? Where's your cast?"

"Removed."

"How could you remove it?" She stomped her foot in frustration. "How will you hold me and the children now?"

He pressed a light kiss to her lips. "One arm is enough."

"I want a princess carry." She lifted her chin, defiance glinting in her eyes. "You're our family's pillar now."

"Alright." His arms tightened around her. "Let me hold you a little longer."

Stella nestled obediently against his chest. "Mr. Grant came to see me today. He took Luna... He said our benefactor doesn’t want us together."

"Would you ever leave me?"

"Of course not!" She bit her lip. "But the benefactor has so much influence. I'm afraid—"

"Don’t be." He kissed her forehead. "It's all over."

Her heart clenched. "What deal did you make with the benefactor this time? What did you give up?"

Adrian laughed softly. "Why do you make him sound like a mob boss?"

"But your injuries..." Her eyes welled up again.

"A life debt must be repaid." His fingers combed through her hair. "Once the lawsuit ends, we'll take the children and Mom away from here."

Stella rested her head on his shoulder. "Is giving up your future worth it... for me?"

"You are my future." His voice was low, certain. "Having you by my side is enough."

A sudden thought struck her. "Oh—that wish about seeing the snow..."

"We'll make it happen." His gaze was unwavering. "Then you can never take it back."

She burst into laughter. "You're such a child."

"I miss those childish days." His eyes softened. "Back when you always wore the floral sundresses I picked..."

"Wait." She jerked her head up. "You chose those dresses?"

Adrian cleared his throat. "I collected quite a few. The floral ones suited you best."

A blush crept up her cheeks. "I'll only wear them for you from now on."

"Then I'm luckier than Adrian Roland."

At the mention of that name, Stella's expression remained calm. "He said he's getting married."

"Does it hurt?"

"No." She shook her head. "I stopped hating him long ago."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "You've really moved on?"

"Without love, there's no hate." She met his eyes. "My heart only has room for you now."

"Then promise me one thing?"

"What?"

"Let me see your injuries!"

Without waiting for his response, she yanked open his jacket. The sight of his waterlogged wound made her gasp.

"How did this happen?"

"Slipped in the rain." His tone was casual.

Tears spilled from her eyes. "You're lying!"

"It's true." He cupped her face. "I was worried you'd be scared of the thunder alone."

The words shattered her composure. She buried her face in his chest. "Don't ever do this again..."

"Alright." He kissed the top of her head. "My brave little star."
###Chapter 209: The Ridiculous Notion of Dignity

"What did you just call me?"

"Little Star." Adrian's lips curved into a smile. "That day at the orphanage, I talked with Oliver for a long time. That child is like an angel—he sings 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' beautifully."

At the mention of Oliver, Stella's heart clenched. "I wonder how he's doing now."

"He's fine." Adrian's voice softened. "Julian said Joy is over the moon. She always envied you for having such an adorable son like Ethan, and now fate has given her a ready-made child."

Stella pressed her lips together. "What about his mother's..."

"He's temporarily forgotten about her passing." Adrian reminded her gently. "Next time you see Joy, make sure you're both on the same page."

"Okay."

She agreed, but her brows furrowed slightly.

"Still worried?"

"Mr. Alistair... what if Oliver remembers everything if he gets triggered someday?"

Adrian was silent for a moment. "It's possible."

"What about you?" Stella asked softly. "Have you remembered anything?"

"Yes."

"Was it... about being separated from your parents when you were young?"

"No." He shook his head. "But that doesn't matter. Little Star, the most important thing in life is choice. Oliver and I are alike—we've both endured pain, but fortunately, we can choose."

Stella blinked in confusion. "You mean... if Oliver remembers, he can choose to forget again? That logic..."

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it." Adrian reassured her. "Joy has a bright personality, and Julian is meticulous. When Oliver is older and stronger, everything will work out."

Her expression eased slightly. "Fate has a strange way of arranging things. Joy never wanted marriage or children, yet she ended up with Oliver. Oliver lost his mother but found Joy..." She paused. "Mr. Alistair, sometimes I feel like... you were sent to save me."

"Why?"

"Because you understand everything about me. Because you love me enough." Her voice was feather-light. "Sometimes I wonder if meeting you is just a dream. What if I wake up and find I'm still that cancer patient lying in a hospital bed—"

Before she could finish, Adrian suddenly cupped the back of her head and kissed her fiercely.

"Mmph—"

The kiss was urgent and rough, only breaking when she gasped for air.

Stella's cheeks burned, her lips slightly swollen. She glared at him. "You really know how to shut me up."

Adrian chuckled darkly. "Don't ever say things like that again."

"...Okay."

"Good girl." He nudged her gently. "Go on, I need to shower."

Stella hesitated. "You..."

She thought being pulled into the bathroom meant...

Had she misread the situation?

Adrian saw right through her and smirked. "What? Want to join me?"

"Absolutely not!" She fled in embarrassment.

Rushing into the bedroom, she buried her face in a pillow, the heat lingering.

How mortifying...

Even in this modern age, for a woman to make the first move—especially when the other person hadn't even hinted at it—

Inside the bathroom, Adrian shut the door.

He turned the shower to full blast, letting the scalding water wash over him as if cleansing all impurities.

A sharp sting flared across his face.

He remembered the hospital, the torrential rain. Kneeling on the ground, kowtowing, while Grant's polished shoe ground into his cheek.

"Adrian Roland, have you really sunk so low for a dying woman that you'd throw away your dignity?"

Dignity?

The Adrian of the past was untouchable, getting everything he wanted.

Now, all he had left was this pathetic pride.

If only he'd let go of it sooner...

Money could be earned again. Power could be reclaimed. If dignity could bring Stella back, why not?

Grant's laughter had slowly twisted into sobs. "Adrian, I still lost."

Rising from the rain, drenched but lighter than ever, Adrian had replied:

"You left. The old man has no choice but to pick me. Everything I have, you handed to me."

"You'll keep your promise?"

Grant had laughed wildly. "Relax, I'm the old man's lapdog. I'll happily take the bones you discard."

Stella was afraid of thunder. He needed to get home quickly.

......

Friday morning. The courthouse.

Stella walked into the grand hall arm-in-arm with her mother.

"Miss Valentine." A man in a tailored suit approached. "We meet again."

Stella froze. "Damian?"

"Yes." The lawyer shifted uncomfortably. "You look much better."

"Are you here to defend Lily and the others?"

"No. I'm your attorney."

"Me?" She was stunned. "This is a public prosecution case. I didn't hire a lawyer."

"Consider it my guilty conscience." Damian smiled bitterly. "I hid for months, but couldn't escape my own conscience."

Grace gave her daughter a questioning look.

"Mom, this is Damian Chamberlain." Stella explained quietly. "He... handled my divorce from Adrian."

"Divorce? When?"

"A long time ago. Before Luna was born."

"Stella, why didn't you tell me—"

"It's in the past." Stella tightened her grip on her mother's arm. "The trial is about to start."

Once seated, Damian pulled a thick stack of documents from his briefcase.

"Damian," Stella whispered, "if the evidence is solid, how long will they get?"
###Chapter 210: Thunderous Judgment

Damian Chamberlain was about to speak when the courtroom doors swung open.

Sophia Durand and Lily Savigny were escorted in by bailiffs, their faces ashen, steps unsteady.

"Miss Valentine," Damian murmured, "you can say whatever you need to today."

Stella clenched her fists.

Mr. Alistair had been elusive these past few days. Whenever she asked about evidence, he'd only reassured her with two words: "Trust me."

"Is Adrian here?"

Damian gestured toward the back. "In the gallery."

The cavernous courtroom stood nearly empty, save for Adrian Roland and his assistant Jason Macmillan sitting conspicuously in the spectator seats.

Jason whispered something to Adrian, whose head snapped up, gaze burning with intensity.

Stella turned away, focusing on the defendants' table.

In mere days, the once-arrogant mother and daughter had withered into hollow shells.

The prosecutor's voice rang out like steel. "Surveillance footage confirms Lily Savigny was the only person entering the villa at the time of the incident. When Martha Clementson fell, Miss Valentine was in her second-floor bedroom."

He held up an evidence bag. "Flour from Martha's wonton dough was found on Lily's clothing. DNA analysis confirms it's a match."

"Roof footprint analysis proves Martha was pushed. Lily's shoe prints intersect with the victim's and show the most recent activity."

The judge leafed through the thick stack of evidence.

Stella accepted the documents Damian handed her, fingers trembling. Screenshots, footprint analysis, physics calculations—each piece of evidence drove another nail into Lily's coffin.

"Thank you..." Her voice cracked.

"Does Miss Valentine wish to add anything?"

"Yes!" Stella shot to her feet. "Six years ago, my father's car accident—Lily tampered with the vehicles at the dealership!"

Lily sprang up shrieking. "Lies!"

"The evidence speaks for itself." Damian presented new documents. "Both vehicles' brake systems were sabotaged. Service records show Lily was on duty that day."

Lily's glare locked onto the gallery. "Adrian! You helped her, didn't you?"

"Irrelevant to this case." The judge's gavel fell.

The prosecutor scanned the new evidence. "This confirms the crash six years ago was premeditated murder."

After lengthy deliberation, the panel accepted all evidence.

Damian then unleashed a barrage of damning revelations:

Medical records proving Luna was fed alcohol
Evidence Ethan's neonatal sepsis resulted from deliberate infection
Ironclad proof of Sophia embezzling from Shi's Jewelry
Stella stared at Damian in shock.

"These arrived anonymously," he said meaningfully. "Perhaps from others they've wronged."

Suddenly, Stella understood.

Mr. Alistair had compiled their crimes all along. The families of wealthy men they'd swindled had secretly gathered evidence.

Only three forces could orchestrate this: Adrian, the Valois family, or...

"Judgment is rendered." The judge's voice filled the courtroom. "Lily Savigny is convicted of premeditated murder and assault. Sophia Durand is convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, fraud..."
###Chapter 211: His Handwriting

The courtroom stood silent as irrefutable evidence was presented.

Lily Savigny's face turned ashen, her nails digging deep into her palms. The judge's gavel struck with finality, the verdict echoing through the solemn hall.

"Wait!" Sophia Durand suddenly rose from her seat.

The judge frowned. "Does the defendant have anything to add?"

Sophia's gaze slithered toward Stella Valentine, her lips curling into a sinister smile. "My daughter is pregnant. The law has special provisions for expectant mothers, doesn't it?"

"Pregnant?"

Sophia turned to Adrian Roland, her voice softening unnaturally. "Adrian, once I'm gone, I'm counting on you to take care of Lily."

Adrian shot to his feet, his chair screeching against the floor.

"Don't believe me?" Sophia pulled a medical report from her bag. "Test her if you must. Adrian, this child is yours. You can't abandon your own flesh and blood."

She extended her wrists willingly as the bailiffs cuffed her. Before being led away, she cast Stella a loaded glance.

As Lily was escorted past Stella by a female officer, she leaned in and whispered, "The game has only just begun."

Stella remained impassive. "You should be talking to Adrian."

"But you're his weakness." Lily chuckled. "As long as you suffer, he'll never know peace."

"He's moved on."

"Has he?" Lily threw a challenging look over her shoulder as the officers pushed her forward. "We'll see about that."

The sunlight outside was blinding.

Stella steadied her mother Grace Laurent as they exited the courthouse, drawing a deep breath. Attorney Damian Chamberlain approached. "Justice delayed is still justice served."

"Some people will never live to see it," Stella murmured, gazing at the cloudless sky.

Damian adjusted his glasses. "Actually...you should thank whoever anonymously provided that evidence."

"I know."

"You know?" Damian looked surprised. "I assumed it was Mr. Roland. The handwriting was nearly identical—"

Stella whirled around. "What handwriting?"

"The shipping label was handwritten," Damian explained. "But if you say it wasn't him, I must've been mistaken."

"Do you still have the label?"

"It's in my office. I can deliver it this weekend?"

"Send it to Brilliant Star Group," Stella nodded.

As Damian left, her heart pounded. She'd recognize Adrian's penmanship anywhere—yet she'd never seen Mr. Alistair's handwriting.

Back at Rosewood Gardens, Martha Clementson greeted them with sleeping Luna in her arms. "Miss Stella, there are strange men patrolling the neighborhood—"

Her phone vibrated.

[Don't worry. They're mine.]

Before she could reply, the phone rang. Mr. Alistair's voice came through, uncharacteristically urgent. "I've booked our flights for tomorrow."

"So soon?" She was caught off guard. "We haven't packed. My mother's arrangements—"

"Everything's taken care of." His voice was hoarse. "Stella, just this once, trust me."

A muffled cough came through the line.

Remembering Mr. Grant's warning, Stella's chest tightened. "Alright, I'll start packing immediately."

"Good girl." A quiet sigh. "I'll...come home early tonight."

Hanging up, Stella looked out the window. The sunset stained the clouds blood-red as dark figures lingered below. For some reason, Lily's eerie smile flashed through her mind, sending a chill down her spine.
###Chapter 212: I Will Marry You

A sharp static burst from the phone.

Stella frowned and pulled the device away from her ear.

The screen showed the call had ended.

She tried redialing, but only heard an automated voice: "The number you dialed is currently unavailable..."

"Miss Valentine, are you leaving tomorrow?" Martha walked over, cradling Luna in her arms.

Stella put away her phone. "Martha, let me settle your payment first—"

"No need!" Martha's eyes crinkled with laughter. "This morning, my bank account suddenly had an extra hundred thousand. The sender was Mr. Alistair. I thought he made a mistake."

Stella understood. "That's your severance pay."

"I can't accept this!" Martha waved her hands. "Working for your family already pays better than most. Both you and Mr. Alistair are so kind, and the children are so well-behaved..."

"Please keep it," Stella said softly. "Unless you'd rather return it to him in person?"

Martha chuckled. "Are you teasing me because I don't know how to transfer money?"

They shared a smile.

"Martha, could you do me a favor?"

"Of course."

"Help me pack Luna's things. I'm afraid I might forget something in tomorrow's rush."

Martha immediately handed Luna back and rolled up her sleeves, heading to the nursery. "You rest. I'll handle it. You're not careless—you just don't want to say goodbye to this old woman..."

Stella's nose stung.

She had endured too many farewells over the years.

Even though she had prepared for this one, the ache still lingered.

Martha worked efficiently, but her voice trembled slightly. "Don't worry about me, Miss Valentine. After you leave, I'll find another job. I managed just fine before meeting your family..."

"Mm."

She heard the unshed tears in Martha's words.

Neither of them acknowledged it.

By the time the packing was done, dusk had fallen.

Ethan returned home with Charlie, darting into Stella's arms like an excited sparrow. "Mommy, I missed you!"

After hugging both Stella and Martha, the boy hurried to the nursery to see his sister, chattering about finishing his homework.

Stella stopped Charlie before he left. "When will Mr. Alistair be back?"

"He asked me to tell you he'll definitely see you tonight." Charlie hesitated. "Miss Valentine... once you're there, please take care of each other."

Stella laughed. "Of course we will. Why say that? Afraid I'll sneak back because I miss the company?"

Charlie forced a smile. "Just a thought. I'll head out now and pick you up tomorrow morning."

"Thank you."

Mr. Alistair said to wait.

After putting the children to bed, Stella stayed awake in the bedroom until late at night.

Stars glittered outside the window, but her phone remained unreachable.

At first, she remained calm. But as the night deepened, her consciousness began to blur.

Tap.

A soft sound startled her awake.

She went to the window and found someone tossing pebbles at the glass.

Under the dim streetlight, his tall figure stood out. A motorcycle waited silently beside him.

When he looked up and smiled, he seemed to glow.

"Little Star, come down."

"We have a flight tomorrow—"

"Come down."

She threw on a coat and rushed downstairs, crashing into his embrace.

He held her tight with one arm. "Did you wait long?"

"Yes. Couldn't this wait until you got home?"

"Get on first."

Effortlessly, he lifted her onto the motorcycle and wrapped his arms around her before starting the engine.

Stella panicked. "Your arm is injured!"

"It's fine."

"What do you mean fine? Can't you just rest properly?"

He rested his chin on her shoulder and chuckled. "I'm too happy today. Don't be mad."

"I'm worried about you."

"The more you worry, the happier I am."

"But you can't play the one-armed hero forever. What if the kids both want to be carried later?"

"It won't happen." His voice softened. "I got it redressed at the hospital today. I can carry the kids—and you—just fine."

She touched the stiff sleeve. It was indeed a cast.

"Where are we going?"

"A secret."

"To see the stars?" She gazed up at the sky. "After tomorrow, these won't be the same stars anymore."

Over the roar of the engine, he murmured, "Hold me tighter."

She turned and wrapped her arms around his waist, pressing her cheek against his chest.

"We can see the stars here. No need to go to Mount Rainier."

The motorcycle shot forward like an arrow.

Wind howled around them, until the world narrowed to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.

"Little Star, can I always call you that?"

"What? I can't hear—"

"Hold on."

The bike accelerated. She closed her eyes and clung tighter.

Time blurred until the motorcycle finally stopped.

"Scared?" He braced against the bike, looking down at her.

She shook her head. "Not with you here."

"You trust me that much?"

"Yes." She nodded firmly. "Completely."

His eyes flickered with emotion before settling into quiet relief. "I've waited so long for this day."

Following his gaze, Stella's breath caught.

Illuminated by the headlights stood a towering tree.

Pale pink blossoms floated like clouds in the darkness.

When the wind stirred, petals drifted down like snow, dusting her hair and shoulders.

The faint, crisp fragrance wrapped around them like a comforting embrace.

"Houston's snow—I found it." His whisper brushed her ear. "Beautiful?"

"Gorgeous... What kind of flowers are these?"

"Weeping crabapple." His voice was tender. "They usually grow up north. I never expected to find them here. Little Star, I've fulfilled your last wish."

She nodded, throat tight.

"Then... what about the promise on the Ferris wheel—"

Before he could finish, she rose on her toes and kissed him.

Just a fleeting touch.

"I accept." Her tears sparkled with joy. "I will marry you."
###Chapter 213: I'm Worth the Wait

"When?" His voice was hoarse.

Stella's heart fluttered. "After we get settled?"

"Too long." He shook his head.

"Right after landing?"

"Still late." He remained stubborn.

Stella laughed. "We can't possibly have the wedding mid-flight, can we?"

"Right now."

"Now?" Her eyes widened. "It's 1 AM. Even bridal shops are closed."

His gaze burned. "Right here."

Stella glanced around. The night air carried floral scents, mingling with fresh earth.

"Let the stars be our chandeliers, petals our aisle. This crabapple tree will witness it." His eyes dropped to her skirt. "Why this dress today?"

She lifted the hem, letting the pale floral sundress flutter in the breeze, blending with falling petals.

"You bought it. I didn’t have time to change before the flight." She lowered her head. "Just grabbed a jacket on my way out."

Only then did Adrian notice the shirt she wore. His shirt.

The oversized fabric draped over her slender frame, the hem covering her dress, accentuating her tiny waist.

"Wrong one..." Her ears turned pink.

"Beautiful." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Just a bit long."

"Postpartum..." she muttered irritably.

Suddenly he leaned in, fingers working the buttons.

"What are you—" She clutched the collar.

"Let's have a Chinese-style ceremony."

Before she could respond, he gently draped the shirt over her head like a veil.

"Mr. Roland..." Her vision blurred.

"East meets West." He took her hand. "Come."

Beneath the crabapple tree, he asked solemnly, "Miss Stella Valentine, will you marry me? In sickness and in health..."

His voice held uncommon gravity in the quiet night.

She nodded. "Yes. Only you."

His lips curved like melting ice.

"And you, Mr. Roland?" she countered.

"Waited too long for this." He exhaled. "For these words..."

"I'm worth the wait, right?"

"Every second."

He removed the makeshift veil. Starlight illuminated her profile, ethereal.

"From now on, we're husband and wife." Soft words.

"Mhm."

"May the groom kiss his bride?"

She rose on tiptoes, arms circling his neck, offering her lips.

He seized control instantly, claiming her mouth.

When she finally pushed back breathlessly: "You said... fusion wedding?"

"We'll host a proper one later." A promise.

She shook her head, cheeks flushed. "What comes after Western weddings?"

"Receptions?"

"And Chinese ones?"

"Banquets."

"Wrong." She bit her lip. "The... wedding night."

His eyes darkened. "Little star..."

She pulled him down. "I entrust Stella to you. Treat her well."

Night wind stirred, petals swirling.

......

The late wind chilled. Nestled in his arms, she murmured drowsily, "Cold..."

He wrapped his coat around her, fishing a star candy from the pocket.

The silver wrapper glinted. For years he'd carried candies—first for her, then himself.

Countless wrappers collected, yet the bitterness never faded.

Until tonight, when the candy finally returned to its owner.

His phone vibrated. 4 AM. Uncle Xavier calling.

Glancing at the sleeping Stella, he answered.

"Adrian, you've disappointed me."
###Chapter 214: You Need to Change How You Address Me, Miss Shi

Dappled shadows danced through the trees as Adrian Roland gently laid the sleeping Stella Valentine against a sturdy trunk. He removed his jacket to wrap around her slender frame before stepping away to answer the call.

"Uncle Xavier."

"Return immediately." Suppressed fury vibrated through the line.

Adrian watched moonlight ripple across the lake's surface. "I owe you my gratitude for these years of mentorship. But the path ahead—I choose it myself."

"Fool!" The old man's voice sharpened. "I made you break your own arm to teach you a lesson! Look at my legs—they're your warning!"

Moonlight glinted off the cast encasing Adrian's left arm. His lips curved. "So what if it's ruined?"

"You think Stella Valentine would nurse a cripple for life?"

"She would."

"Naive!" Xavier's voice shook. "Someone once promised to be my crutch too. Where are they now?"

"Uncle." Adrian's gaze frosted over. "You've used that story to manipulate me for a decade. I could've loved her properly. Instead, you forged me into a revenge machine."

A ragged inhale sounded through the phone. "You blame me?"

"I dare not forget my debts." Adrian's eyes found Stella's sleeping form. "But hurting her remains my life's greatest regret."

"You'll live to rue this!"

"Losing her is the only regret that would haunt me forever."

The phone described a graceful arc into the lake as he ended the call. The splash startled a nightingale from its perch.

When Adrian returned, Stella was rubbing her eyes. Moonlight gilded her silhouette, transforming her into a lost woodland sprite.

"Lost your phone?" She frowned.

"Must've dropped it."

"No more reckless driving." She poked his chest.

He captured her hand. "As you wish, Mrs. Roland."

"What did you call me?"

"Mrs. Roland." His breath warmed her ear. "The kind who can never escape."

Stella rested her head against his shoulder with a soft laugh. "I must've owed the Roland family a fortune in my past life."

Leaves whispered overhead in the night breeze.

"Darling, will you tell me your real name now?" She tilted her face up. "A wife should know her husband's name."

"Isn't 'darling' enough?"

"How embarrassing when neighbors ask."

After a pause, he admitted, "...I have no name."

Stella's eyes sparkled. "I understand! You must've been kidnapped as a child." Her fingers brushed his cheek tenderly. "Don't worry, I'll give you a new one."

"Adrian Roland II." Her smile mirrored the crescent moon above. "The 'II' means returning home."

His brow arched. "Is my wife hinting at something?"

"Of course not!" Blushing, she explained, "It's for when our children learn to write."

Starlight caught in her hair like scattered diamonds.

"Overbearing Dragon Regrets." She murmured suddenly. "Like how you'd reach for me, then pull back."

Adrian's breath hitched. His little star always pinpointed his deepest wounds with poetic precision.

"Very well. From now on, I'm Adrian Roland II."

"Adrian II."

"Wrong." He tweaked her nose. "Time to change how you address me, Miss Shi."

The night air turned scorching. Stella's ears burned crimson before she managed a whisper: "...Husband."

A satisfied sigh escaped him as he tightened his embrace. "Remember it. Don't forget."

"I won't!" She playfully thumped his chest. "Such a nag."
###Chapter 215: If I Can Save Him, I Can Destroy Him Again

Dawn light crept across the horizon, painting the sky pale.

Stella Valentine glanced at her phone. 4:15 AM.

"It's time," she murmured.

Adrian Roland nodded, about to start the motorcycle when she caught his sleeve.

"Let's take one more wedding photo." Her voice was feather-soft.

Every girl dreams of her wedding portraits.

A white gown studded with pearls, its train billowing like clouds. The groom should wear a crisp white tuxedo with the tie she chose herself, waiting for her at the end of a flower path.

But reality—

Her skirt was smeared with dirt. His black trench coat damp with dew. Behind them, a weeping crabapple tree bloomed brilliantly, utterly out of place in a wedding scene.

Stella raised her phone. The screen framed their embrace.

Click.

"Let's go."

The motorcycle roared to life, crushing fallen petals beneath its wheels.

"Is this the backside of Mount Rainier?" She suddenly recognized the location.

"Yes. Tourists only come up the front trails."

"That crabapple tree must be twenty years old—"

Screeching brakes split the dawn.

The world spun as he shielded her with his body. They hit the ground hard. Darkness swam in her vision.

"Good morning, Miss Valentine."

An elderly man in a maroon tang suit sat in a wheelchair, idly rolling walnuts in his palm.

Stella forced her eyes open. Mr. Alistair's face was bloodied, his black coat saturated with crimson.

"An ambulance!" Her trembling hands found only shards of her shattered phone.

"Want to save him?" The old man's voice was calm.

Her pupils contracted. The timing. The location. That familiar stretch limousine...

"You're...Mr. Xavier?"

"Clever." He chuckled. "But too late for epiphanies."

She crawled to Mr. Alistair. His skin was ice-cold.

"What are your terms?" Her voice shook.

Mr. Xavier checked his watch. "The flight leaves soon. Take your time deciding—see how long he lasts."

"Grant."

Grant Rubenstein emerged from the car, leaning on a cane, half his face bandaged.

"This is the price of betrayal." Mr. Xavier sighed. "I've shown Adrian more mercy than he deserves."

The blood pool widened.

A familiar torn page from her diary appeared before her.

"Write him a letter," Mr. Xavier said. "One that will make him let go."

...

The airport intercom announced final boarding.

Charlie Macmillan held the twins while Grace Laurent scanned the crowd frantically. Spotting Stella, she waved desperately.

The limousine's tinted window lowered.

Mr. Alistair lay curled on the backseat, his face ashen, brows furrowed in pain.

"Remember your promise." Mr. Xavier's voice followed her. "If I can save him, I can destroy him again."

Stella wiped her tears and ran toward the gate without looking back.
###Chapter 216: The Complete "Death" of Adrian Roland

The airport announcement echoed the final boarding call.

Charlie Macmillan stomped his foot anxiously. "Miss Stella! We'll miss the flight!"

Stella Valentine hurried forward with her daughter in arms, her face as pale as parchment.

"Where's Mr. Alistair?" Charlie peered behind her.

"Him?" Stella's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Once the money was transferred, he became disposable."

Charlie's eyes widened. "What are you saying?"

"Don't pretend you don't understand." She snatched the boarding pass from his hand. "All those months of acting, and this paltry sum is my payoff. Pathetic."

Little Ethan tugged her sleeve timidly. "Mommy..."

"Let's go." Stella marched toward the gate without looking back.

Grace Laurent carried Ethan while chasing after her. "Stella, what on earth—"

"Not now, Mother." Her voice trembled.

As the plane ascended, Stella watched the shrinking city through the window, silent tears streaking her cheeks.

"Don't cry, Mommy." Ethan wiped her face with small hands.

Grace moved to sit beside her, gripping her daughter's ice-cold fingers.

......

Hospital corridors hummed with fluorescent lights. Grant Rubenstein ended his call.

"Uncle Xavier," he whispered. "Jason talked. Adrian originally planned...to make 'Adrian Roland' disappear completely."

Mr. Xavier Atlante narrowed his eyes. "Go on."

"He intended to stage an accident, then assume his twin brother's identity...to live abroad with Stella."

"Clever." Xavier's laugh held no warmth. "Repurposing that stillborn twin story from the Roland family history."

"What's our move?"

"Wait." Xavier tapped his cane. "If he forgets that woman, business as usual. If not..."

Grant nodded in understanding.

"Grant," Xavier suddenly turned, "do you know why I chose him over you?"

Beads of sweat formed on Grant's forehead.

"Not competence." Xavier's gaze pinned him. "Temperament. You panic too easily."

The heart monitor's steady beep filled the sterile room.

Adrian Roland lay swathed in bandages, his breathing shallow.

"Stella..." His lips barely moved.

A nurse leaned closer. "More delirious murmuring."

"This tie..." Another nurse held up a bloodstained plaid necktie. "He refused to let go during surgery."

Outside the window, dusk deepened.

The EKG suddenly spiked with erratic peaks.

"Doctor! He's waking up!"
###Chapter 217 That Was Humiliating to Me

"Mr. Roland, the legal department received some important documents..."

Adrian didn't look up, his slender fingers typing on the keyboard. "File them directly."

Lynn Watson tightened her grip on the express envelope. "But these were sent by the Shi Group..."

"I said file them." His voice was icy. "Do you not understand English?"

Lynn bit her lip. "Mr. Roland, my probation period ends next week..."

"Not anymore." Adrian finally lifted his gaze, sharp as a blade. "Go to HR and complete the formalities."

"Mr. Roland!" Her eyes instantly reddened. "What did I do wrong? Tell me, I'll improve!"

Adrian pressed the intercom. "Security, escort Ms. Watson out."

Julian Valois walked in just as this scene unfolded.

"Adrian, losing your temper again?" He motioned for Lynn to leave first.

Adrian buried himself in the files again. "I'm busy."

Julian glanced at the takeout boxes littering the floor. "You didn't go home again last night?"

"Hmm."

"I heard you're getting married?" Julian cut straight to the point. "To that Ms. Evans?"

Adrian's pen paused mid-signature. "You're well-informed."

"Engaged after three meetings?" Julian frowned. "Are you serious?"

"She's quiet. Doesn't cause trouble." Adrian closed the file. "She's suitable."

Julian laughed in disbelief. "You think this is like buying furniture?"

"Is there a difference?" Adrian walked to the window and lit a cigarette. "I need a wife. She needs the title of Mrs. Roland."

"You've changed." Julian's voice turned grave. "Ever since you woke up in the hospital, you've—"

"Shut up." Adrian's eyes darkened through the smoke. "Don't mention the hospital to me."

Julian sighed. "Don’t you really want to know what happened during those months?"

"No." Adrian stubbed out the cigarette. "That was humiliating to me."

The office fell into dead silence.

"I won’t attend the wedding." Julian stood up. "But the gift will arrive."

Adrian suddenly asked, "What’s her full name?"

"Who?"

"Ms. Evans."

Julian stared at him in shock. "You don’t even know your fiancée’s name?"

"It’s unimportant." Adrian said flatly. "She’s just a placeholder."

Julian shook his head and left. At the elevator, he ran into Lynn, her eyes still red.

"Mr. Valois..." She handed him a coffee. "Your latte."

Julian drank it in one gulp. "Don’t take it to heart. He’s always been like this."

Lynn suddenly turned and rushed back into the CEO’s office, slamming a large express envelope onto the desk.

"Mr. Roland!" Her voice trembled. "You need to see this!"

Adrian, in the middle of a video conference, turned livid. "Get out!"

"This is the Shi Group returning your family’s assets!" Lynn stood her ground. "All your parents’ companies!"

Adrian’s hand froze on the mouse.

"The legal department said you just need to sign, and they’ll all be yours again." She straightened her back. "Just say yes or no."

The video conference continued on the screen, but Adrian seemed deaf to it. Slowly, he opened the top envelope. The old logo of the Roland Group stared back at him.

The companies swallowed nine years ago were now intact in his hands.
###Chapter 218: The Flowering Tree in the Dream

Lynn Watson's fingers trembled slightly as she clutched her resignation letter.

She took a deep breath and pushed open the glass door to the CEO's office. Adrian Roland was in the middle of a video conference, his eyes fixed on the screen without even glancing up.

"Mr. Roland, these packages—"

"Leave them on the desk." His voice was cold as ice.

Lynn bit her lip and gently placed the stack of parcels in the corner of the desk. As she turned to leave, the sound of rustling paper made her pause.

Adrian had ended the meeting and was opening one of the envelopes. His hands froze, his knuckles turning white.

Lynn glanced back and saw the signature on the document in his hands—Stella Valentine.

Those three words struck Adrian like a knife to the temple. He snapped the file shut, his chest heaving.

Three years.

Since the car accident, Stella had vanished without a trace. She had taken the children and disappeared, never looking back—not even when his life hung in the balance.

"Legal department," he rasped into the intercom. "Process these documents with my personal seal."

When Lynn was called back into the office, her eyes were still red. She had just sent her resignation to HR.

"Compensation will be transferred to your account," Adrian said without looking up.

The glass door clicked shut behind her. Lynn wiped her tears and strode toward the elevator without a backward glance.

As dusk settled, Adrian massaged his throbbing temples. The phone rang—Uncle Xavier.

"Caught a grouper. Come for dinner."

He agreed and called for a driver. As the car merged into evening traffic, he leaned back against the leather seat, his consciousness drifting.

In his dream, there stood a towering tree.

Pink-white petals fluttered down like snowflakes. Beneath the tree stood Stella in a floral sundress, her face tilted upward as petals dusted her lashes.

"Sir? Sir!"

A blaring horn jolted him awake. The driver chuckled awkwardly. "Someone cut in front of us..."

Adrian waved him off and rolled down the window. The salty sea breeze rushed in, but it couldn't dispel the dream.

"Is there..." he suddenly asked, "a very large flowering tree in Houston? Pink and white."

The driver scratched his head. "A cherry blossom tree? Never heard of one that big."

The beachfront villa glowed with warm light. Old Mr. Xavier was listening to an opera, his fingers tapping the armrest in rhythm.

"Nightmare?" The old man noted Adrian's pallor.

Adrian stared at the dark sea beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows. "I dreamed of Stella."

Grant Rubenstein emerged from the kitchen on his cane, pausing at the words. The aroma of steamed fish filled the room, but the air had gone still.
###Chapter 219: Night Vision

Mr. Xavier's smile froze for a split second before quickly relaxing. "You must be overworking yourself lately. Go for a checkup tomorrow. That Dr. Lowell wasn't competent. I'll introduce you to a better psychiatrist."

Adrian gave a slight nod, then shook his head. "I can't leave right now. The company is negotiating several major projects."

"I see..." Mr. Xavier visibly relaxed, speaking earnestly. "Adrian, I've entrusted my entire empire to you. Don't disappoint me."

"You have my word." His voice was low.

"I've always had faith in you."

The chef approached with a freshly steamed grouper, its aroma filling the air.

Mr. Xavier patted his arm. "Try today's catch."

Adrian's muscles tensed instantly, remaining rigid.

"My memory fails me!" Mr. Xavier withdrew his hand regretfully. "Does your arm still hurt?"

A wave of excruciating pain surged, lasting several minutes.

He rose slowly. "It's fine."

"Really?"

"Just some discomfort during rainy days." Adrian took a deep breath. "It doesn't affect daily life."

Mr. Xavier sighed, shaking his head. "You've suffered too much. First, losing both parents in that car crash. Then nearly dying in the second one. If my men hadn't arrived in time..."

"I owe you my life."

"Enough of that." Mr. Xavier waved dismissively. "I treat you as my own son, which is why I'm passing everything to you. Adrian, don't let another woman derail you this time."

Adrian's gaze sharpened abruptly. "Derail? That's an understatement."

"Let's not dwell on her. Eat first."

The dining table was laden with exquisite dishes, vibrant and fragrant.

Only after Mr. Xavier picked up his chopsticks did Adrian follow suit.

"By the way, how's the investigation on that Ms. Evans?"

Adrian meticulously removed fish bones, placing the tender flesh into the elder's bowl. "Comes from an ordinary working-class family. Introverted. A quiet office worker."

"Good." Mr. Xavier nodded approvingly. "She'll make a suitable wife, won't interfere with your career."

"Mhm."

"Marry her soon."

"Understood."

Mr. Xavier pressed further. "What about Lily Savigny?"

"I'll follow your lead."

"Proceed legally." His expression turned benevolent. "Send the child to an orphanage. As a Buddhist, I believe in accumulating good karma. Donate to the orphanage on my behalf another day."

Adrian agreed silently.

Leaving the beachfront villa, he called for a designated driver.

The inexperienced driver took detours and deliberately chose bumpy roads, grating on his nerves.

"Sorry, sir. First time in this area..." Max stammered apologies.

Adrian suppressed his irritation. "Turn on the GPS."

"Right away..."

The navigation proved accurate. Within five minutes, they merged onto the main road.

BAM—

A deafening crash.

Adrian lurched forward, nearly hitting the front seat.

"Sir, I—"

He stepped out grimly to assess the rear-end collision.

His Maybach had plowed into a Porsche. Both vehicles' rear ends were severely dented.

The Porsche's driver—a red-haired youth covered in tattoos—stormed over aggressively.

Adrian raised a hand to stop him. "Name your price."

The redhead held up two fingers. "Not a cent less!"

"Two million?" Adrian pulled out his phone. "QR code."

The redhead gaped. He'd hoped to extort 200k, never expecting such an astronomical offer.

He hastily presented his payment code. The moment the transfer cleared, he sped off like a fugitive.

"Sir, I'm so terribly sorry..." Max approached trembling. "It's pitch black here. I couldn't see a thing..."

Adrian scanned their surroundings. "Black?"

"Can't even see my hand in front of my face!" Max scratched his head anxiously.

Yet Adrian saw everything with crystal clarity.

"Are you visually impaired?"

"My vision's 20/20!"

"Then why couldn't you see?"

A passing motorist chimed in. "Buddy, this stretch has no streetlights. Accidents happen daily."

Another driver concurred. "We've filed countless complaints."

Adrian frowned deeply.

Everyone claimed it was dark—except him.

What was this?

Night vision?

He smirked self-deprecatingly.

"Sir, about the damages..." Max's voice quivered. "I just started this job. Got kids to feed..."

"You're off the hook." Adrian's tone was flat. "But I won't pay for this ride."

Max nearly collapsed with relief, bowing repeatedly before fleeing.

Adrian contacted his insurance company to handle the wreck, remaining onsite.

While checking emails, he noticed Lynn's resignation.

Though merely a secretary, she reported directly to the executive office—requiring his approval.

Seeing the severance package, he replied: [Add one year's salary as bonus.]

Houston's nightscape glittered brilliantly, traffic flowing endlessly.

The accident caused a growing backup.

Joy pounded her horn impatiently. "A crash on the main road? Unbelievable! Stella, want to detour?"

"No rush." She gazed out the window. "After three years, Houston hasn't changed."

"Are you kidding?" Joy rolled her eyes. "It's way more congested now!"
###Chapter 220: The Man Who Stole Her Breath

Stella Valentine chuckled softly. "No rush. Let's wait a little longer."

"Aren't you worried Ethan and Luna will get impatient? Those two are so bold—traveling alone on a flight! The plane should've landed by now. With this traffic, I'm not sure we'll make it in time."

Stella remained calm. "Ethan knows his limits."

"That he does," Joy Fairsprene said proudly. "My godson got his brains from his father, but his character is far superior. That scumbag ex of yours doesn't deserve to be called human."

At the mention of him, Stella fell silent.

Joy changed the subject. "How long are you staying this time?"

"It depends on my mother." Stella sighed. "She's been dreaming about my father lately. Since his death anniversary is coming up, I brought her back to visit his grave. We'll return once she's at peace."

Joy hesitated. "Stella...why not stay in Houston? Your father's company is still here. Things are chaotic overseas—nowhere is as safe as home."

"I know..."

"Wait—don't tell me you've met someone abroad?"

Stella laughed. "Between work and the kids, I barely have time to breathe, let alone date."

"Then why insist on living overseas?" Joy lowered her voice. "Is it...because of Mr. Alistair?"

Stella's fingers clenched the fabric of her skirt.

"I remember...his accident happened just days before your father's death anniversary. Are you returning now because..."

Joy trailed off.

That fateful morning three years ago, Mr. Alistair and Stella had been heading to the airport when their car was struck.

In the end, Stella flew abroad with her children and mother. Mr. Alistair...never left the hospital.

Joy sighed inwardly. No wonder Stella avoided Houston—this city held too much pain.

Just when Mr. Alistair had begun helping her heal, he was ripped away in an instant.

"Stella, I know a temple with powerful blessings. Let's visit soon," Joy offered gently.

"Alright."

The accident ahead was finally cleared, and traffic began moving. Joy floored the accelerator, speeding away from the congestion.

They arrived at the airport twenty minutes late.

Ethan was buying milk for his sister at a convenience store. Three-year-old Luna still drank milk daily.

"Brother..." Luna suddenly tugged Ethan's sleeve, pointing into the distance. "Mommy..."

Ethan hastily paid and scooped her up. "Mom! Aunt Joy!"

"My goodness! Who is this handsome young man?" Joy's eyes sparkled. "Only eight and already this dashing? You'll break hearts when you're older!"

Luna immediately wrapped her arms around Ethan's neck. "Mine!"

The tiny girl's adorable voice melted Joy's heart. "Let me hold you! You're too precious!"

Luna glanced at Stella for permission before reaching out.

"Does living abroad make children this beautiful? Especially Ethan—he's the spitting image of that scumbag Adrian!"

Ethan frowned. "Scumbag?"

"I mean...'wow guy'!" Joy backpedaled. "Someone so handsome people say 'wow' when they see him."

Ethan tilted his head. "Aunt Joy, did you make that up?"

"Of course not! It's internet slang. You wouldn't know living overseas."

"Really?"

"Absolutely!" Joy said without blinking. "Would I lie to you?"

Ethan studied her. "Aunt Joy, I trust you, but your eyes keep darting to the lower left when you speak. That's a classic sign of lying. In negotiations, opponents would've called you out already."

Joy laughed helplessly, pinching his cheek. "You little rascal! When did you learn to expose people?"

Stella suppressed a smile. "Alright, Luna needs her nap. Let's head to the hotel."

Joy drove them back, unaware her choice of lodging made Stella uneasy.

When she'd learned of Stella's return, Joy had booked rooms at the Houston Grand Hotel. Stella only realized upon arrival but didn't want to refuse her friend's kindness, planning to switch hotels later.

As they pulled up, Joy's perennial struggle resurfaced—parallel parking.

"I'll do it," Stella said.

"You can drive now?"

"Had to learn overseas. For school runs."

With practiced ease, Stella reversed into the spot, impressing Joy. "Stella, you're amazing at this!"

Once parked, Stella invited, "Come up for a bit."

At least their room was only on the eighth floor.

Grace Laurent had been anxiously waiting. "Ethan! Luna! Let Grandma see you...how could you fly alone? Mommy told you to wait at home!"

"Grandma, I missed you!" Ethan threw himself into her arms.

Grace immediately softened, hugging him. "Don't ever do that again, understand?"

Ethan nodded. "Grandma, I wanted to see Daddy. That's why we came."

"But your father..."

"Daddy went to fight monsters, I know. But he's been gone so long...shouldn't he be back by now? Grandma, I really miss him."

Grace sighed. "Well, you're here now...are you hungry? Let Grandma make noodles."

Luna piped up in her tiny voice. "Grandma, want eggs!"

"There aren't any in the hotel. I'll buy some tomorrow, okay?"

A growl interrupted them—Luna's empty stomach protesting.

Ethan explained, "She barely ate on the plane. The food was bad."

"I'll go buy some." Stella grabbed her wallet. "There's a supermarket nearby."

Joy stood. "It's late—want company?"

"No need, I know this area." Stella smiled. "You've been driving us around all week. Wait here—I'll get ingredients to cook you something nice."

"Yay! Your chicken soup is the best!"

"I know."

Stella rode the elevator down alone.

Ding—

The doors slid open on the first floor.

Both occupants froze—one inside, one outside the elevator—

Their eyes locked in stunned recognition.
###Chapter 221: Countdown

The elevator was so quiet they could hear each other's breathing.

Charlie suddenly let out a mocking laugh and stepped aside to clear the path.

As Stella Valentine stepped out, rapid button presses echoed behind her.

When the doors closed, her heart sank like a stone in her chest.

The hotel lobby at midnight stood empty and silent, a stark contrast to the airport chaos three years ago.

Charlie's panicked face flashed in her memory again.

"Miss Valentine, have you been deceiving Mr. Alistair all along?"

The boarding announcement blared in her ears. She closed her eyes with a faint smile. "What else?"

"But why? Mr. Alistair, he—"

"This is Adrian Roland's debt to me." She cut him off. "A father's debt paid by the son. A brother's debt paid by the sibling."

Charlie froze as if struck by lightning. "You don't know Mr. Alistair is actually—"

"Miss Valentine, final boarding call!"

She walked toward the gate without looking back.

Actually what?

None of it mattered now.

Stella took a deep breath and entered the convenience store. Her basket held daily necessities and the eggs her daughter had requested.

Back in the suite, only a wall lamp illuminated the living room.

Her mother Grace had already put Luna to bed. Joy Fairsprene dozed on the sofa with a sleepy Ethan in her arms.

"Stella!" Joy startled awake, nearly tumbling off the couch.

Ethan rubbed his eyes and rushed into her arms. "Mommy..."

She stroked his soft hair. "Go to sleep. Mommy needs to talk with Aunt Joy."

"But the eggs for Luna—"

"Little foodie." Joy yawned. "Auntie will make dancing steamed eggs tomorrow!"

Ethan nodded obediently, then suddenly remembered. "Uncle Hugo said Celeste spilled the milk powder. He wants you home early."

Her fingers twitched. "Got it."

Once the boy was in his room, Joy immediately leaned closer. "Celeste? As in sun, moon, stars, and Celeste?"

"Yes."

"She's almost three now? Younger than Luna..."

A tender light flickered in Stella's eyes at the mention of her daughter. "A little monkey. She just ripped up a million-dollar contract yesterday."

"Oh my!" Joy's eyes widened. "That's some destructive power..."

"Luckily she listens to Ethan." Stella massaged her temples. "Scolding does nothing, but one look from him and she sits right down."

Joy burst out laughing. "Sibling authority."

Her smile suddenly faded. Fidgeting with her fingers, Joy hesitated. "Three kids must be exhausting, especially Celeste..."

"Mom and Mr. Merovingian help." Stella gazed out the window. "Being busy is good. Too busy to think..."

Joy suddenly hugged her. "Celeste is so lively. Does that mean...?"

"The doctor says it's just a matter of time." Stella's voice was feather-light. "Three reasons for this trip. Celeste's treatment. Visiting Dad's grave..."

"And the third?"

"What's today's date?"

"December 16..."

"Half a month left." She murmured to herself.

"Left for what?"

Stella shook her head and fell silent.

After Joy went to sleep, she stood alone on the balcony. The night sky glittered like scattered diamonds.

......

New Frontier Group CEO Office.

The HR director peeked in nervously. "Mr. Roland, the secretary candidates—"

Adrian Roland braced against the desk as darkness clouded his vision.

"Another all-nighter?" The director reached to steady him but was coldly brushed aside.

In the conference room, a row of elite candidates sat ramrod straight.

Adrian scanned them, his temple throbbing.

"These are your selections?"

The director wiped his brow. "All PhDs from top schools with five-plus years—"

Resumes rustled as pages flipped. Suddenly, one landed in the trash.

"Mr. Roland! That's Milan Design Institute's—"

"Next."

Another hovered over the bin.

"This one has five years as an executive secretary!"

Only one resume remained. Adrian stared at the photo as if trying to see through the paper.

The director held his breath. Seventeen secretaries had come and gone in two years.

"Her."

Adrian strode out, leaving stunned candidates in his wake.
###Chapter 222: Room 0826

The HR manager exhaled in relief. Finally, a candidate had caught Mr. Roland's attention.

She flipped through Penny Anderson's file, her frown deepening. The girl had average qualifications and unremarkable looks—completely ordinary among the applicants.

Adrian Roland's hiring criteria remained an enigma.

"One more thing." Adrian turned abruptly at the conference room door. "Everyone works this weekend to finish the proposal."

The HR manager paled. "But Mr. Roland, this weekend is your—"

"Five times overtime pay."

"It's not about the money. You're getting married this Saturday."

Adrian's expression didn't change. "A formality. One hour maximum. I want the proposal on my desk before afternoon work resumes."

After he left, Penny whispered, "Does overtime happen often here?"

The manager gave a wry smile. "Our CEO is a workaholic. Last year's company speech? 'Don't sleep too much while alive—you'll have eternity to sleep after death.'"

Penny's eyes widened. "That's a heart attack waiting to happen."

"But the salary compensates." The manager showed five fingers. "$100K monthly—highest in Houston for this position."

Penny swallowed. Regular executive assistants earned $30-50K. The offer was undeniably tempting.

"Let's process your onboarding." The manager paused. "Company rules: No floral dresses. CEO's office lights stay on 24/7. Mr. Roland only drinks lukewarm water."

"Alcohol shielding too?" Penny hesitated.

The manager patted her shoulder. "$100K a month. Your first task this afternoon—pick up Ms. Evans for her wedding dress fitting."

Penny blinked. "The groom isn't going?"

"Just a business alliance marriage." The manager shrugged. "Ms. Wendy's decent. Keep her company."

At 2 PM, Penny drove Adrian's luxury car to Houston Grand Hotel.

Room 0829. She pressed the doorbell, repeating the number silently.

A boy of about seven answered. "Who are you looking for, ma'am?"

"Sweetie, does Ms. Evans live here?"

The child eyed her suspiciously. "My mom lives here."

Penny froze. A graceful woman in a white dress emerged—porcelain skin, willow-leaf eyebrows.

"Ms. Evans?" Penny ventured. "I'm Mr. Roland's assistant, here for your dress appointment."

The woman frowned slightly. "Wrong room. This is 0826."

Penny then noticed the fallen numeral—the 6 had flipped to resemble a 9. She apologized profusely and left.

A shrill voice echoed from down the hall. "What's taking so long?"

The real Wendy Evans stood there—heavy makeup, haughty demeanor. "New hire? Can't even read numbers?"

Penny opened her mouth to explain.

Wendy waved impatiently. "A female driver? Send a man instead!"
###Chapter 223: My Husband Passed Away Three Years Ago

Penny Anderson stood by the office door, nervously twisting the hem of her blouse. On her first day at work, she was already facing a crisis. Beads of sweat formed on her forehead.

"Miss Evans, I'll go find you a driver right away."

Wendy Evans waved her hand impatiently. "Hurry up. Adrian is waiting to see the wedding dress photos."

Penny bit her lip and stepped out. She didn’t know anyone in the company—where was she supposed to find a male driver?

"Maybe... I could call you a chauffeur service?"

Wendy sneered. "Then what’s the point of having you here?"

A sudden knock interrupted them.

Penny cracked the door open, confused. Outside stood a woman in a floral sundress. Her delicate features were like a painting, and she dangled a set of car keys from her fingers.

"You dropped these outside my door."

Penny frantically checked her pockets, her heart sinking. If she’d lost those keys with the Maybach logo, her job would’ve been over.

"Thank you so much!"

The woman smiled faintly and turned to leave.

"Wait!" Wendy suddenly rushed forward, her gaze sharp as a blade as it raked over the woman’s face. "Have we met before?"

Stella Valentine studied the bespectacled girl in front of her. So this was Adrian Roland’s fiancée? Compared to all the glamorous women from his past, she was... painfully ordinary.

"I just returned from abroad."

Wendy pressed, "Are you sure we’ve never met?"

Stella tucked the keys into Penny’s hand. "Keep them in your inner pocket. They won’t fall out there."

Penny suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Miss, could you do me a favor?"

"What is it?"

"Your husband... could he drive Miss Evans to her bridal fitting? I can’t find a male driver anywhere..."

Stella’s eyes dimmed. "My husband... passed away three years ago."

The air froze.

But Wendy kept staring at Stella’s face. She’d definitely seen it before—in Adrian’s wallet, on that old photo trimmed down to the size of a palm.

"Can you drive?" Wendy asked abruptly.

Stella arched a brow. "Yes."

"Then take me there."

Stella scoffed. "Why should I?"

"I..." Wendy faltered, then clenched her jaw. "Consider it... a favor for my fiancé?"

At the word "fiancé," Stella’s fingers trembled slightly. She snatched the keys. "Let’s go. We’re wasting time."

In the underground parking lot, Stella walked straight to the Maybach. She moved with the familiarity of someone returning home.

As the engine started, Wendy suddenly asked, "How did your husband die?"

"Car accident." Stella kept her eyes on the road. "A truck hit him head-on."

In the rearview mirror, Wendy’s face turned deathly pale.

When the car stopped in front of the bridal boutique, Wendy bolted out as if fleeing. She finally remembered—on the back of that photo, there had been a handwritten note: "Stella’s 20th birthday."

And the girl in the picture, wearing that same floral sundress, had been smiling at her.
###Chapter 224: Sudden Blow

"The meeting is adjourned. Submit the proposal to my office by next Monday."

The atmosphere in New Frontier Group's executive conference room was suffocating.

Adrian Roland loosened his tie with sharp irritation as he stood. The persistent ache in his chest reminded him of Uncle Xavier's warning. He decided to get a medical checkup.

"Mr. Roland, your stomach condition is concerning." The doctor adjusted his glasses, expression grave. "Your report indicates long-term, high-dosage sleeping pill use?"

"Yes."

"Records show you have bipolar disorder. Were these taken during manic episodes?"

He nodded impassively. "Attempted suicide a few times."

"Times?!" The doctor's eyes widened.

"Four or five. Lost count." Adrian's tone was as casual as discussing the weather. "Later, insomnia got worse. Pills were the only solution."

The doctor shook his head. "Your stomach can't handle this! You must stop immediately."

"Unnecessary."

"Your gastric perforation just healed. Continuing this could cause abdominal hemorrhage—life-threatening!"

Adrian frowned. "I'll deal with it when it happens."

"By then, it'll be too late!" The doctor flipped through charts. "Oddly, there's a six-month gap in your medication history. How did you sleep then?"

"Memory loss after the car accident. Don't recall."

The doctor sighed. "Any recent suicidal thoughts?"

"No." His reply was steel. "I'm busy."

Charlie's call came the moment he left the hospital.

"Sir, Ms. Evans went wedding dress shopping."

"Keep watching."

Charlie hesitated. "The driver was... Stella Valentine."

Adrian's left hand clenched the steering wheel. White-hot pain shot through his arm—a lingering effect from the crash, worse on rainy days.

But now, the agony in his chest eclipsed it entirely.

"Sir, I suspect Ms. Evans is Stella's plant. Her family's company has poached several clients..."

"Impossible." Adrian scoffed. "She's not that cunning."

"But Mr. Xavier warned—women deceive best! Lily Savigny proved that, and Stella once—"

"Enough!" His voice slashed like a blade. "I've investigated the accident. She went abroad to give birth to Ethan."

Charlie persisted. "But later she—"

"Silence!" Adrian inhaled sharply. "Send me the boutique address."

He hung up and slammed the accelerator.

Inside the bridal shop, Wendy Evans twirled before the mirror. "This one or the previous?"

Penny Anderson stood silent nearby. Stella had meant to leave, but the girl's limping gait made her stay.

While arranging Celeste's surgery, Stella received devastating news.

"The donor backed out?" Her voice trembled.

"A high school student prepping for military academy." The doctor suggested, "Have you considered the father? Blood relatives have higher match rates."

Stella's vision darkened. She braced against the wall to keep from collapsing.

Ask Adrian? He wouldn't even acknowledge the children...

"Miss?" Penny limped over. "Could you help Ms. Evans choose?"

"Emergency." Stella forced composure. "Take a taxi back—request male drivers."

As she turned, gasps rippled through the staff.
###Chapter 225: Adrian, You're Pathetic

Wendy froze.

She never expected Adrian to call her by that affectionate nickname.

His tall frame loomed over her, the sharp angles of his profile deepening under the lights. The blend of cologne and faint tobacco on him made her pulse quicken inexplicably.

"Don't worry about me. Your work comes first."

"Have you picked a wedding dress yet?"

"Not yet..." She hesitated. "When did you start smoking? I remember Dad saying you didn't."

"Quit before." His voice was low. "Work's been stressful lately. Just an occasional one."

"Your cologne... smells nice."

"Eau de Cologne." He answered curtly. "Never used to wear it. Got used to it now."

"To mask the smoke?"

"...Yeah."

Adrian's gaze darkened.

Even he found the lie laughable. Three years ago, that car crash nearly killed him. Uncle Xavier had dragged him back from death's door.

By then, Stella had already sent Lily to prison with evidence before vanishing without a trace.

When he woke, only Uncle Xavier sat by his hospital bed in a wheelchair, hair turned white overnight.

At twenty-three, Uncle Xavier saved him once.
At twenty-nine, he did it again.

Two lives. He could never repay that debt.

This cologne soothed his bipolar disorder, but did nothing for the emotions churning inside him now.

She was back.

After three years abroad with that so-called "Mr. Alistair," she'd reappeared here.

Adrian clenched his fists. The citrus scent lingered in his nose but failed to dull the ache in his chest.

He forced himself not to look at her, yet her presence filled his senses—

Footsteps.
Voice.
Even her breathing.

The corner of his mouth lifted in self-mockery.

Adrian, you're pathetic.

"Mr. Roland..." Wendy called softly, cheeks flushed. "Don't stare at me like that."

Only then did he realize his gaze had settled on her face.

Whatever.

If she'd moved on, why should he cling to the past?

"Those earrings suit you," he remarked flatly.

Wendy touched them in delight. "Bought them at a street stall for just a few dollars."

"If you like them, the price doesn't matter."

The words made her heart skip.

During their previous arranged meetings, he'd always been all business. This version of Adrian felt unfamiliar yet thrilling.

"Found a wedding dress yet?" he asked.

"Not yet..." She gathered her courage. "Could you help me choose?"

Adrian walked toward the bridal section, scanning the rows of white gowns until his eyes locked onto one.

"This one."

Wendy followed and gasped.

Pearlescent satin with blood-red floral embroidery cascading from the waist like a shower of petals.

"I want to try it!"

The clerk hesitated. "The size won't fit. We just sold an identical one yesterday."

Wendy's hand lingered on the skirt in disappointment. The dress was clearly too large for her petite frame.

"Alter it." Adrian's tone brooked no argument. "We can postpone the wedding."

"But..." Wendy bit her lip. "Could someone model it first so I can see how it looks?"

The clerk glanced around and brightened. "That lady over there would be perfect!"

Adrian followed her pointing finger and his pupils constricted.

Stella was helping a girl toward the seating area.

A girl he recognized—Penny, the secretary he'd just hired this morning.

"Mr. Roland!" Penny straightened anxiously. "I twisted my ankle, but I won't let it affect work!"

Adrian didn't respond, his gaze locked onto Stella.

"This kind lady drove Miss Wendy here," Penny explained hurriedly.

"Drove?" He scoffed. "Since when could she drive?"

Stella closed her eyes.

There was no escaping this.

For a moment earlier, she'd almost thought she saw Mr. Alistair.

Until she heard Adrian speaking to Wendy, reality crashed back.

Her Mr. Alistair had died over three years ago on that road to the airport.

No funeral. No grave.

Only Joy's choked voice on the phone: "Stella, don't cry... Julian's handling it... I'm so sorry."
###Chapter 226: The Taste of Jealousy

A sharp pain suddenly pierced her heart.

"Ah—" Penny Anderson gasped in surprise.

Stella Valentine quickly released her grip. "Sorry."

"It's fine." Rubbing her wrist, Penny asked cautiously, "Stella, did you... know Mr. Roland before?"

The air froze for a moment.

"Yes." Stella lowered her lashes. "Distant relatives."

"Relatives?" Adrian Roland let out a cold laugh.

The answer made his chest tighten.

The woman who once shared his bed was now just a "distant relative."

"I see!" Penny exclaimed. "No wonder you helped me. By the way, are you attending Mr. Roland's wedding this weekend?"

Ahem! Adrian coughed loudly.

Wendy Evans secretly sighed in relief. But something about Stella's delicate profile unsettled her.

"Miss... Stella," Wendy forced a smile as she approached. "My apologies for earlier. We'll be family soon."

Stella nodded coolly. "It's Valentine."

"So you and Adrian are..."

"Cousins."

Wendy eagerly linked arms with her. "Stella, could you help me try on wedding dresses? You have such a perfect figure—"

Stella withdrew her arm. "A bride's gown shouldn't be worn by outsiders."

"Outsiders?" Adrian cut in sharply. "If we're family, can't you do this small favor?"

"Does family mean unconditional compliance?"

"She called you 'sister.' Is this how you respond?"

Stella clenched her fists. "Mr. Roland still enjoys forcing people into corners, I see."

"I haven't changed." He stepped closer. "You know that best."

"Excuse me." Stella handed the keys to Penny. "Take your time shopping."

"Wait." Adrian blocked her path. "Didn't you leave the country with that man? Why are you back?"

"Personal matters."

"I want to see the children." His voice tightened. "Three years. I have visitation rights."

"Another day."

"When?" His gaze turned piercing. "In such a hurry to avoid me?"

Stella took a deep breath. "Tomorrow. I need to go to the hospital now."

Adrian's expression darkened. "Are you sick?"

"Not me."

"Ethan? Or Luna?"

"No."

His eyes turned icy. "His child with you?"

Stella looked away. "Think what you want."

"Give me back my children." His voice grew hoarse. "Since you've started a new family—"

"And then what?" Stella laughed bitterly. "Let your fiancée play stepmother?"

"They can live with Grandfather."

"Mr. Alistair treated Ethan and Luna as his own." Her voice trembled. "He stayed up all night when they cried, took them to school. Where were you?"

Adrian fell silent.

"I won't argue in front of your fiancée." Stella gripped her bag strap. "Three years ago, you said you'd found true love. I wished you happiness. But now? Forcing your ex-wife to model wedding dresses?"

"I just—"

"The children stay with me." Her tone was final.

Adrian's gaze darkened. "No man is that devoted to another's children. I don't believe it."

"Suit yourself."

"Now that he has his own blood, do you really think—"

"He's dead." Stella's words cut through the air.

Adrian froze.

"I won't remarry." She lifted her pale face. "Satisfied?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "...How?"

Stella didn't answer.

Houston felt like a curse. Every time she returned with hope, despair awaited.

"That child..." Adrian's voice turned rough. "Is the illness serious?"

"Congenital liver disease. Needs a transplant."

"Found a match?"

"There was one." Her smile was bitter. "They backed out today."

Adrian frowned. "Hereditary? His father—"

"Unknown."

"You didn't even know that?" He sneered. "Some 'true love.'"

Stella's head snapped up.

"Adrian Roland." She enunciated each word. "Your obsession with Mr. Alistair makes me wonder—"

"Are you jealous of a dead man?"
###Chapter 227: How Dare You Judge Him?

Adrian's breath hitched.

His fingers clenched into fists, knuckles turning white.

"Jealous?" He let out a cold laugh, eyes darkening. "I'm getting married soon. What would I have to be jealous about?"

Stella pressed her lips together.

She suddenly realized her mistake.

This man was about to enter a new marriage, and her words had been dangerously close to sowing discord.

"My apologies," she murmured. "I must have misremembered."

Adrian's gaze swept over her face.

She'd lost weight.

The dark circles under her eyes betrayed sleepless nights.

"So it wasn't Victor after all," he said abruptly.

Stella froze.

"I've told you repeatedly—Mr. Valence has nothing to do with this."

Adrian looked away. "The dead can't return. Focus on taking care of the children. If they suffer under your care, I'll bring them back to the Roland family."

"That won't be necessary." She shook her head wearily. "Your fiancée is waiting."

As she turned to leave, a thunderclap froze her in place.

BOOM—

Torrential rain poured down without warning.

Houston's weather was always this capricious—clear skies one moment, thunderstorms the next.

Stella instinctively flinched.

A warm hand suddenly closed around her wrist, pulling her into a solid embrace.

"Don't be afraid."

The gentleness in his voice made her dizzy with nostalgia.

"Little star, don't be afraid."

Memories flooded back.

"You're scared of thunder, so I rushed home to be with you."

"What's a little rain? I'll take a hot shower and hold you while you sleep."

"Stella, you'll never have to fear thunder again. I'll always be here."

Always?

Her heart ached dully.

Adrian's betrayal had been a knife to the heart, but Mr. Alistair's departure was sandpaper, grinding away at her soul day after day.

"Why the tears?" Adrian frowned. "Still that afraid?"

She shook her head, pushing away. "I'm fine."

"Is it because of the child's illness?" His voice turned venomous. "That was fraud. He knew about the genetic condition yet still had children with you! Thank God he's dead, otherwise—"

"Enough!" Stella's tear-filled eyes blazed as she looked up. "How dare you judge him? You're the last person on earth with that right!"

Adrian's face darkened. "Fine. Your bond was unbreakable, while what we had meant nothing!"

"That's not what I meant." She turned away. "You're getting married. You should be happy."

He sneered. "Now you sound like my elder."

Elder?

An absurd phrase popped into Stella's mind: a sister-in-law like a mother.

She nearly laughed at the ridiculous thought.

When she looked up, she saw Wendy and Penny's shocked expressions.

Sliding off her opal bracelet, she thrust it at Wendy.

"If I'm your elder, I should give a welcoming gift." She forced a smile. "May you have a lifetime of happiness."

Wendy didn't accept it. "What... exactly is your relationship?"

"Relatives." Stella's smile strained. "We likely won't see each other much going forward."

She hurried to the sales associate. "Is this the wedding dress?"

Grabbing the gown, she fled into the fitting room.

The dress fit perfectly.

When she emerged, everyone held their breath.

"Stunning!" Penny gasped.

The clerk marveled, "This gown looks tailor-made for you!"

After a quick spin, Stella changed back into her clothes.

Not daring to glance at Adrian, she bolted into the downpour.

"Adrian?" Wendy called uncertainly.

He finally looked away. "Hmm?"

"Those children you mentioned—"

"Some questions are better left unasked." His tone turned icy. "Remember our agreement?"

Wendy tightened her grip on the opal bracelet.

Gazing up at this towering man, she suddenly felt an impassable chasm between them.

"Mr. Roland, shall we reserve this dress?" the clerk asked timidly.

Adrian turned to Wendy. "Do you like it?"

"...It's beautiful."

"Let's find another. There must be one more suited to you."

Tears welled in Wendy's eyes. "Because she wore it first, so I'm unworthy?"

"That's not what I meant."

"I want this one!" Wendy insisted stubbornly. "No others!"

Adrian's expression frosted over. "Ms. Evans, you've changed."
###Chapter 228: Calligraphic Script

The bridal boutique's lights stung her eyes.

Wendy Evans clutched her skirt with bone-white knuckles, her manicured nails nearly drawing blood from her palms. She glared at the man before her, voice trembling. "Adrian Roland, what do you mean by this?"

Adrian kept one hand in his trouser pocket, his tie still perfectly knotted. "Exactly what I said."

"Because of that woman who barged in?"

"I told you, she's irrelevant." He checked his wristwatch. "Miss Evans, our terms were clear from the beginning. I need a wife who won't interfere with my private life. And you—"

"And I was stupid enough to think you'd change!" Wendy ripped off her veil and flung it to the floor. "Is this how the Roland family treats their fiancées?"

Torrential rain lashed against the glass doors.

Penny Anderson shrank into the corner, wishing she could melt into the walls. As she inched toward the exit, her high heel twisted. A sharp pain shot through her ankle.

"Stay."

Adrian's voice froze her in place.

"M-Mr. Roland..." She fought back tears. "I'll go to HR to resign immediately..."

The man turned abruptly, his black suit glinting coldly under the lights. "Your handwriting is decent."

"Excuse me?"

"Calligraphic Script." He took two steps closer, eyes dropping to her swollen ankle. "Who taught you?"

Penny instinctively retreated until her back hit the chilled glass. "My grandmother..."

The rain intensified.

Wendy stormed toward them in stilettos, tear tracks ruining her flawless makeup. "Adrian! You'd rather chat with an intern than explain yourself to me?"

"Nothing to explain." He didn't bother turning. "Secretary Anderson, fetch the car."

Penny's eyes widened. "Me?"

"Now."

The Maybach cut a sleek arc through the downpour. Penny's hands shook on the steering wheel. In the rearview mirror, Adrian scrolled through his phone, the blue light sharpening his jawline.

"Sir..." she whispered, "I only got my license two months ago..."

A sudden brake sent them both lurching forward.

Adrian steadied himself against the seat, eyes darkening. "Your resume stated three years of driving experience."

"Well..." Penny forced a laugh. "I drove my cousin around for three years..."

The wipers struggled against the deluge.

Without warning, Adrian leaned in, his cedarwood cologne enveloping her. Penny held her breath as his long fingers flipped on the hazard lights.

"Pull over."

"Yes, sir..."

"Why apply for a secretary position?"

Penny blinked. Rain streaked the windows, distorting her reflection. "Because... the pay was good?"

Adrian smirked and retrieved his wallet. Penny glimpsed a photo in the card slot—a girl in a school uniform, seen from behind.

"I'm flying to Milan in three days." He handed her an embossed business card. "Heal that ankle."

She took it numbly. The gold foil letters burned her eyes: Executive Assistant to the CEO, New Frontier Group.

"I'm... not fired?"

"Keep talking and you might be."

The storm-veiled city resembled a watercolor painting. Penny stole a glance at the man beside her. He stared out the window, the mole on his throat bobbing with each swallow.

Suddenly, she remembered the red circle around the word "Star" on her resume.

In the curve of that stroke hid something inexplicably familiar.
###Chapter 229: A Token to Remember

The floor-to-ceiling windows of Houston Grand Hotel framed the deepening twilight.

Grace Laurent paced anxiously across the room. The sound of the turning lock made her whirl around.

Her breath caught at the sight of Stella Valentine—drenched from head to toe.

"Stella! Where have you been?"

An unseasonable chill gripped Houston in December.

Grace fumbled for a blanket, wrapping it tightly around her daughter's trembling shoulders. She pressed a steaming mug into Stella's ice-cold hands.

"Mom."

"Yes?"

"I need to sleep."

Grace studied Stella's bloodshot eyes, hesitating. "Thinking about Mr. Alistair again?"

Stella stared blankly at the rising steam. "I saw him today."

"What?" Grace nearly dropped the teacup. "But you said he was—"

"The same face. Even the cologne." A bitter smile twisted Stella's lips. "Maybe I'm hallucinating."

Grace pulled her into a crushing embrace. "About Celeste's condition—"

"I will save her." Stella's head snapped up, her gaze terrifyingly resolute.

Outside, thunder roared. Raindrops hammered against the glass like that fateful night three years ago.

She could still see Mr. Xavier Atlante standing motionless in the downpour, his black umbrella glistening. The memory of Grant Rubenstein pressing his cane against Mr. Alistair's temple burned in her mind.

"Made your decision, Miss Valentine?"

"I'll leave." Kneeling in the torrent, she tasted rainwater mingled with tears. "Please save him."

"Write a letter." Mr. Xavier toyed with his walnut. "You know what to say."

The cane suddenly slammed onto Mr. Alistair's injured left arm. His scream tore through the storm—

"No!"

Stella jolted awake, her nightgown soaked with sweat.

On the nightstand, a concert ticket gleamed under the lamplight. Harry Vance's handsome face smiled up at her from the promotional photo.

Joy Fairsprene gasped upon entering. "Stella!"

"Just a cold." Stella tucked the ticket into her bag. "About the 31st—"

"I know. Your promise with Mr. Alistair." Joy's eyes reddened. "But Stella, it's been three years..."

"Only three." Stella watched the easing rain outside. "Our four-year promise still has days left."

Her fingers traced the C-section scar on her abdomen—

A permanent reminder of Celeste.
###Chapter 230: Is Daddy Back?

The flu hit Stella Valentine like a tidal wave.

She spent three full days unconscious in her hotel room before regaining enough strength to move.

Today was her father's death anniversary. Summoning her last reserves of energy, she took both children to the cemetery.

Grace Laurent never showed up.

"Mommy, will Grandpa like my candies?" Luna Roland stood on tiptoes, arranging colorful sweets before the tombstone.

Ethan Valentine quietly placed his treasured Transformer toy beside it. "Grandpa, I'll protect Mommy for you."

Stella's throat tightened as she stared at her father's photograph—forever frozen at fifty.

"Mommy!" Luna suddenly tugged her sleeve. "Can Grandpa really hear us?"

Kneeling, Stella gathered both children into her arms. "Of course he can."

Ethan looked up with startlingly bright eyes. "What about Daddy?"

Her heart lurched.

"If Daddy's been fighting bad guys all this time, does he hear me every day?" Ethan's voice trembled with hope.

Luna wriggled free. "Let's shout really loud! Then Daddy will hear!"

Hand in hand, the children tilted their faces skyward. "Daddy, come home!"

Their innocent voices echoed through the silent graveyard.

Stella's eyes burned.

"Mommy, I'll recite Daddy's poem!" Luna began chanting in her baby voice, "Who in the clouds sends letters down..."

Stella gaped at her daughter.

She'd only read Li Qingzhao's "A Twig of Mume Blossoms" to Luna once.

"Mommy, Daddy lives inside this poem, right?" Luna blinked enormous eyes. "When he comes back, I'll recite it first!"

......

Adrian Roland stood frozen nearby, white chrysanthemums slipping from his grasp.

That cry of "Daddy" pierced his heart like an arrow.

"Mr. Roland?" Penny Anderson whispered.

He didn't hear her. His gaze locked onto the slender figure in black.

"Daddy!" The little girl suddenly shrieked, pointing at him.

Both children came charging like tiny cannonballs—only to skid to a halt when they saw his face.

"Not Daddy..." Luna's lower lip wobbled.

Ethan squeezed his sister's hand. "Our daddy's handsomer."

Adrian stepped forward.

The black suit accentuated his broad shoulders. Backlit by the sun, his chiseled features cast sharp shadows.

The children stared up at him, transfixed.

"Daddy...?" Luna tentatively reached out a small hand.
###Chapter 231: Belated Apology

"......Daddy?"

Ethan's footsteps halted abruptly, his small hands clutching the hem of his shirt.

He tilted his face up, eyes wide and round, as if afraid he might be mistaken. He took two tentative steps forward.

Suddenly, fat tears rolled down his cheeks. "Daddy! Why did you take so long to come back?"

The little boy launched himself into Adrian's arms like a tiny cannonball, wrapping his limbs around him as sobs wracked his small frame.

Seeing her brother, Luna tried to mimic him, but she had only just learned to walk. The cemetery steps made her wobble unsteadily. When the little girl missed a step, Stella's heart leaped to her throat.

Adrian reacted instantly. His right hand caught Luna securely while his left arm still held Ethan.

Luna's face paled from the sudden weightlessness, her lips trembling on the verge of tears. She studied the unfamiliar man with curious eyes, her small fingers unconsciously twisting the fabric of her dress.

Adrian's heart melted completely.

Three years had changed Ethan—he'd grown taller, his features unmistakably resembling his own. And Luna—

Her frilly pink dress, the tiny bow in her hair, the plump cheeks still rounded with baby fat.

He slowly knelt, setting Ethan down before lowering himself until he was eye-level with Luna.

"Luna," he murmured softly.

The little girl blinked her large eyes and gave a timid wave.

"Do you know who I am?"

Luna tilted her head, glancing between her brother and him, her lips pressed tightly together.

Adrian opened his arms, his voice impossibly gentle. "I'm Daddy."

She turned to Ethan for confirmation. After receiving an eager nod, she whispered, "...Daddy."

"Yeah." His throat tightened, eyes burning. "Can Daddy hold you?"

Luna took small, hesitant steps into his embrace. Adrian cradled her with utmost care, as if she might break. The sweet milky scent clinging to her made his eyes sting.

This was the scene Stella arrived to witness.

The tall man knelt reverently on the ground, holding their daughter like fragile treasure. Ethan clung to his back, face flushed from crying.

"Daddy..." Ethan sniffled. "Did you beat all the bad guys?"

Adrian looked up in confusion, meeting Stella's complicated gaze.

"Ethan," she said gently, "let Daddy rest for a while."

"I'm not tired." Adrian adjusted his grip on their son before asking her, "Here to visit your father?"

Stella nodded. "And Uncle Shi. You? Paying respects to your parents?"

Only then did she remember—today marked the anniversary of all three elders' passing.

"Don't bother going," Adrian said suddenly.

Stella arched a brow. "Still not worthy to offer them incense?"

"...I know the truth about the car accident now." His voice was hoarse. "Stella, I owe you an apology—"

"Don't." She turned her face away. "I've survived just fine without you."

"Really... survived well?"

"Every obstacle overcome." She wiped a tear from the corner of her eye. "I made it through the hardest days."

A raindrop landed on Luna's forehead.

"Mommy!" the little girl gasped. "It's raining!"

Stella glanced at the sky. "It's December—why is it raining now?"

But Luna was delighted, pounding her father's arm with tiny fists. "Daddy, look!"

Adrian grunted, his muscles tensing instantly.

"What's wrong?" Stella frowned.

"Nothing." He was already scooping Luna up with one arm and taking Ethan's hand with the other. "Let's get to the car."

Without waiting for her response, he strode toward the cemetery exit. Stella had to jog to keep up.

The rain intensified. By the time they reached the car, their clothes were damp.

Adrian turned on the heater and handed her his suit jacket. "Put this on."

"Give it to the children."

"Your lungs are weak." His eyes met hers in the rearview mirror. "Take care of yourself first."

Ethan obediently draped the jacket over Stella's shoulders. "Mommy, hurry! Did you forget about the cold because you missed Daddy?"

Her ears burned. "Don't talk nonsense."

"I heard you crying at night."

Cornered by her son's revelation, Stella floundered for a response.

"We're staying home tonight," Adrian announced abruptly.

"Really?" Ethan cheered, bouncing in his seat as he listed all the old friends he wanted to see.

The children's excitement eased the tension in the car. Soon, lulled by the warm air, both dozed off nestled against Stella.

Only the sound of steady breathing and the heater's hum filled the vehicle.

"You're injured?" she asked in a hushed tone.

"...Old wound." His smile was strained. Luna might look delicate, but carrying her strained his arms. His left arm, already painful in rainy weather, throbbed mercilessly. Cold sweat dampened his temples.

In the rearview mirror, Stella's profile appeared almost unchanged from three years ago—only softened by motherhood.

"You told the kids... I went to fight bad guys?"

Stella stiffened. "No."

"Ethan said so." A faint smile touched his lips. "You said Daddy was amazing. That... you missed me."

"What I told our son," she cut in sharply, "was about Mr. Alistair. Not you."
###Chapter 232: I'll Remember for Him, Until My Last Breath

Adrian Roland's smile froze on his face.

Stella Valentine gently removed her suit jacket and draped it over their sleeping son.

"I'm their father."

"But Mr. Alistair raised them."

Adrian's breathing turned ragged. "I took care of Luna."

"You took her from the hospital without permission." Stella's voice was ice. "Left her with Benjamin Langley, then ran back to Lily Savigny."

"I—"

"Enough."

Adrian clenched his fists. "You let my children call another man 'Dad'? You could've told me."

"You knew." Stella frowned. "You even wished me happiness."

"Happiness?" Adrian scoffed. "That opportunist con artist deserves you?"

"Con artist?" Fire flashed in Stella's eyes. "And what are you? You never gave me a chance to explain."

"I was..." Adrian's voice cracked. "Not myself back then."

"And now you're cured?"

"..."

"But you were perfectly sane when choosing Lily?" Stella's voice trembled. "Your illness discriminates?"

Adrian's hands flexed. "I wanted to make things right, but you vanished."

"What about Miss Wendy Evans?" Stella's lips curled. "Should an engaged man be saying these things?"

"It's just a business arrangement."

"Really?"

"You walked away with that man without looking back. What was I supposed to do?"

"So you got engaged?"

Adrian gave a bitter laugh. "The overseas deal requires a married status. I've only met her three times."

Silence.

"Now you're back, and he's..." Adrian softened his tone. "Maybe we could..."

"There is no 'maybe.'" Stella's voice cut like steel.

"You'll mourn him forever?" Adrian looked stricken. "He's worth that?"

"Mr. Merovingian asked me the same question." Stella met his gaze. "He asked why you were worth it."

"That lawyer?" Adrian's face darkened.

"It doesn't matter." Stella whispered. "Mr. Alistair taught me—if you don't care, it doesn't hurt."

The words stabbed Adrian's heart.

"I'd rather you hated me."

"Not caring is how I survived."

"And now?" Adrian stepped closer. "Can you let him go?"

Stella shook her head. "No."

"Why?"

"He had nothing." Her voice broke. "If even I forget him, he'll truly disappear. I'll remember for him, until my last breath."

The car plunged into silence.

Thirty minutes later, they stopped before a villa.

Stella's pupils contracted.

Their former marital home.

"Let's go inside." Adrian stood by the car door, holding their daughter.

"This isn't home."

"A hotel is?"

"..."

"The children deserve proper beds."

Stella laughed coldly. "Your home is with Lily. Mine is..."

"Where?"

"Not here." She lifted the waking Ethan. "We'll take a taxi back."

"Wow!" Ethan blinked sleepily. "Such a pretty house!"

"Do you like it?" Adrian crouched to his level. "We're staying tonight."

Ethan burrowed into Stella's arms. "This isn't home."

"Home is where Daddy is."

"I want our real home." Ethan's voice quivered. "This place is too big."

Adrian reached out, but the boy flinched away.

"What makes a home?" Adrian rasped.

Stella tightened her hold on their son. "Wherever Mr. Alistair was—that was home."
###Chapter 233: Just to See for Mr. Alistair

"He's gone!"

Adrian Roland's suppressed roar startled little Luna in his arms. The little girl rubbed her sleepy eyes and asked in a sweet voice, "Daddy, who's gone?"

His Adam's apple bobbed as he stared at his daughter's innocent face, unable to speak.

Stella Valentine swiftly stepped out of the car and pulled Luna into her arms. Suppressing her anger, she said coldly, "If you're still emotionally unstable, we'll leave first."

Luna squirmed in her mother's arms, looking longingly at Adrian. "Isn't Daddy coming home with us?"

"Daddy has work." Stella patted her daughter's back gently. "Grandma is waiting for us. Say goodbye to Daddy, Luna."

The little girl obediently waved. "Bye, Daddy."

Ethan clutched his mother's sleeve tightly, taking two cautious steps back.

A wave of unprecedented defeat washed over Adrian. Softening his tone, he pleaded, "Ethan, Luna, stay with Daddy, okay?"

Luna blinked drowsily.

But Ethan shook his head firmly. "You've changed, Daddy."

"How?"

"You never used to yell at Mommy."

Adrian gave a bitter smile. "Daddy was just tired. It won't happen again." He crouched down. "Can you help Daddy talk to Mommy?"

Ethan looked up at Stella.

But Stella's gaze was drawn to the distance—where a black-clad figure on a motorcycle sped toward them through the backlight.

The engine's roar made the ground tremble slightly.

The tall man, dressed entirely in black with a full-face helmet, approached like the wind—

"Mommy, who's that?"

"That's..."

Stella's heart skipped a beat. That silhouette was too familiar.

With a screeching halt, the motorcycle executed a perfect skid stop in front of them. The man planted one long leg on the ground and smoothly removed his helmet.

He smirked. "Long time no see, Stella."

"Mommy..." Luna stared at the motorcycle, eyes sparkling. "I wanna ride that..."

"Oh? This your daughter?"

The light in Stella's eyes dimmed instantly. Calmly, she introduced, "Victor, this is my daughter Luna and my son Ethan."

Both children greeted politely, "Hello, Uncle."

"The little girl is gorgeous—just like you." Victor Valence studied Ethan, then glanced at Adrian with a scoff. "Father and son look alike too."

Ethan puffed out his chest. "I'm Daddy's son!"

Victor teased, "What about your sister? Doesn't she look like Daddy?"

"Sister looks like Mommy!"

Victor laughed. "Quick thinker, huh?"

Adrian yanked Ethan behind him, glaring coldly. "My son takes after me."

Victor's smile faded. "What, afraid I'll steal him?"

"Haven't you stolen enough business?"

"Business can't compare to kids."

"My son is smart and adorable. Who wouldn't love him?"

Victor raised an eyebrow. "Now you claim him? Back when Stella was sick and struggling to raise them alone, you were too busy playing the field."

"That's family business."

"Divorced means it's not your family anymore." Victor turned to Stella. "I came to talk about us."

Adrian sneered. "You?"

"Better than you." Victor smirked confidently. "At least my hands are clean—unlike yours, with more women than I can count."

"None of your concern."

Victor shrugged. "All I see is Stella avoiding you."

He stepped closer to Stella. "Need a ride home?"

Stella stared at the motorcycle, lost in thought. "What model is this?"

"MV Agusta Brutale. You know bikes?"

She shook her head. "Just... feels familiar."

"Familiar?" Victor chuckled. "This beast isn't exactly 'friendly.'"

Stella forced a weak smile.

"Are you crying?" Victor noticed the redness at the corners of her eyes. "Tears over a motorcycle?"

As he moved closer, Ethan blocked him.

The little boy spread his arms protectively. "Stay away from my mommy!"

Victor laughed helplessly. "I'm not a bad guy."

"Still no!"

"Alright, alright..." Victor raised his hands in surrender. "This bike costs over twenty grand. Want one?"

Stella nodded. "Yes."

"For yourself?"

"Yes."

Victor looked stunned. "Seriously? This model isn't for women."

"Is there a law against women riding?"

"Well, no." Victor scratched his head. "You've changed."

"People change."

Victor tried to dissuade her. "There are safer ways to entertain kids. This bike's acceleration—"

"I know." Stella cut him off. "I've ridden one before."

Luna wriggled, reaching for the motorcycle. "Mommy, I wanna try..."

Victor patted the seat. "Hop on! Uncle will take you for a spin!"

"Wow!" Luna's eyes sparkled.

Victor sighed. "Those eyes—just like yours."

Stella held Luna tighter.

"Too dangerous." Adrian's voice was stern. "I'll drive you."

"No need." Stella replied coolly. "Focus on your wedding. Don't forget my invitation."

Just to see for Mr. Alistair.

After all, you're brothers.

"Just to what?"

"Nothing."

The motorcycle roared to life. Ethan perched on the fuel tank while Stella settled behind with Luna in her arms.

"Let's go!" Victor shot Adrian a mocking gesture before speeding off with the family.
###Chapter 234: Derailed

Victor kept his motorcycle at a restrained speed.

With two children riding behind him, he deliberately slowed down to maintain a smooth ride.

The bike came to a gentle stop in front of Houston Grand Hotel.

Ethan, seated at the front, gripped the handlebars with tiny hands, his eyes sparkling. "This is so cool!"

Luna bounced excitedly on the back seat, squealing in her baby voice, "Cool bike!"

Stella couldn't help but smile at their enthusiasm.

Mr. Alistair owned an identical model.

The realization that her children loved this bike just as much warmed her heart.

Even the shattered pieces of her heart, broken by Adrian's cruelty earlier, felt momentarily soothed by this warmth.

Victor removed his helmet and shook out his hair. "I've never ridden this slow in my life. Felt like crawling."

"Thank you for bringing us back."

"Don't thank me." He flashed a roguish grin. "I just wanted to piss off Adrian. Giving you a ride was a bonus."

Stella lowered her lashes. "I see."

"Hey, you actually believed that?" Victor looked exasperated. "You think I'd go all the way out there just to annoy him? That place was in the middle of nowhere."

She pressed her lips together.

The villa had indeed been remote.

So remote it lacked surveillance cameras, forcing Mr. Alistair to go to great lengths to gather evidence against Lily.

Victor's tone turned serious. "Seeing that place today... I can't believe you lived there for four years. I don't know whether to admire your strength or call you foolish."

Stella hesitated before speaking softly. "Victor, could I trouble you for a moment?"

"What is it?"

"Yes." She nodded. "Let me take the children upstairs first. Would you wait for me?"

He raised an eyebrow. "A private chat?"

"Not like that." Her gaze lingered on the black motorcycle. "I just... want to know more about this bike."

Victor studied her thoughtfully before nodding. "Alright. I know a thing or two about bikes. My afternoon's free anyway."

"Thank you."

After entrusting the children to Grace, Stella nearly sprinted to the elevator.

When it didn't arrive, she pivoted and dashed down the emergency staircase, taking the steps two at a time.

By the time she reached the hotel entrance, beads of sweat dotted her forehead.

Victor leaned against his bike, surprised. "No need to rush. I said I'd wait."

Stella reached out, her fingers tracing the bike's contours.

"Didn't peg you for a fan of heavy bikes." Victor pulled out his phone. "Let me introduce you. This is MV Agusta's latest Brutale 1000RR limited edition..."

He launched into a technical monologue about carbon fiber construction, 208 horsepower, and semi-dry sump design.

"Got all that?" He looked at her expectantly after his spiel.

"What?" She blinked.

His eyes widened. "You didn't hear a word I just said?"

"Sorry. Those specs mean nothing to me."

"Figures." He shrugged. "Women usually just care about looks. But does this really match your taste?"

Her fingers glided along the frame until they reached the handlebars. "Victor, could you ride this one-handed?"

"Depends on the speed."

"Very fast. Fast enough that the wind would sting your eyes."

"Impossible." He shook his head. "This beast is hard enough to control with both hands. One-handed? That's suicidal. I'm not ready to die young."

Stella met his gaze. "So you can't do it?"

"Hey!" His ears turned pink. "I'm saying it requires insane arm and core strength. No normal person could manage it!"

"I see."

"But I could take you for a real speed demon ride." His eyes lit up with enthusiasm. "Let you feel true adrenaline."

Stella recoiled, her face paling. "No! Absolutely not!"

"Stella." Victor narrowed his eyes. "You're acting strange today. What does this bike remind you of?"

She took a deep breath. "Victor, could you teach me to ride?"

"Sure." He crossed his arms. "But first tell me why this bike has you so distracted."

......

The villa felt oppressively empty.

Adrian rarely came here—only on the night Luna was conceived, and when Martha died.

After Stella left, he couldn't bring himself to return.

Not that he didn't want to. He didn't dare.

Every inch of this place still carried her essence.

"Back so soon?"

The voice from the darkness made him jump.

Mr. Xavier sat in his wheelchair, shrouded in shadows by the curtained window. Despite the bright sunlight outside, the heavy drapes blocked every ray.

"Uncle Xavier? What are you doing here?"

"That's my question." The older man tapped his cane. "With work piling up at the office, you said you were visiting your parents' graves."

"I..." Adrian faltered. "Just wanted to check on the place."

"Adrian, I heard everything at the door."

"......"

"Remember what I told you?" The cane struck the floor sharply. "Women are never to be trusted! Stella claimed to love you, then threw herself into another man's arms. In mere months, she discarded over a decade of feelings. After three years, her heart still belongs to that man. You mean nothing to her!"

"Uncle Xavier!" Adrian growled. "I know!"

"I'm trying to save you from repeating mistakes!" Xavier sighed. "What's so special about her? Without her, you were exceptional. Why does her presence always derail you?"
###Chapter 235: The Tangled Heart

Adrian Roland set down his glass with an impassive expression. "Nothing like that."

"Really?"

"Mhm." He walked to the wine cabinet, fingertips grazing the bottles before selecting a Bordeaux. "Just didn't want to appear too cold in front of the children."

Mr. Xavier exhaled in relief. "It's been three years. Time to let go."

"I know my limits."

"That's why I'm here." Xavier frowned. "This villa is too remote. Inconvenient for work."

Adrian swirled his wine. "Been house-hunting. Nothing suitable yet."

"How's the wedding prep?"

The glass froze mid-air.

"Called it off."

"Why?"

"Wasn't right."

Xavier looked startled. "You praised her just days ago."

"She wanted too much." Adrian stared at the swirling liquid. "Emotional commitments... I can't give that."

"This is for the best."

"...Yeah."

An engine growled outside.

Grant Rubenstein entered leaning on his cane, scanning the room. "Miss Stella's not here? Saw you two canoodling at the doorstep earlier."

Xavier's face darkened.

Adrian chuckled. "Poor eyesight, Grant. I was holding my daughter. You must've seen Victor."

"Victor?" Xavier looked skeptical.

"He's always been attentive to Stella."

Seeing Adrian's composure, Xavier forced a laugh. "Easy mistake in this dim light." He turned to Grant. "Let's go."

As the taillights disappeared, Adrian hurled his glass against the floor.

Shards exploded like frozen tears.

He pulled out his phone and dialed.

One hour later, the doorbell rang.

"Dr. Klein?"

The bespectacled woman nodded, eyeing the pill bottles on the table. "Who prescribed these?"

"My previous psychiatrist."

"Not effective?"

"Insomnia worsened. Emotional outbursts increased."

Dr. Klein opened her notebook. "Rapid-fire test. Answer immediately."

"Apple or banana?"
"Apple."

"Red wine or white?"
"Red."

"You have gastritis."
Adrian hesitated. "Occasional drinks."

"Continue. Day or night?"
"Night."

"Black or white?"
"Black."

"Love or not?"
"Love."

His head snapped up mid-word.

Dr. Klein closed her notebook. "Mr. Roland, your subconscious contradicts your narrative."

"Meaning?"

"The scenes you're suppressing—moonlit nights, starry skies, flowering trees, photographs." She adjusted her glasses. "And someone you deeply love."

His knuckles whitened.

###Chapter 236: I Could Never Love You

What is love?

The question flashed through his mind unexpectedly.

"Love is the hand that reaches out but pulls back."

Dr. Emily Klein looked up in confusion. "What?"

Adrian Roland shook his head. "Nothing. Just remembered something."

"Memory works in mysterious ways. It comes back when it's meant to." Dr. Klein closed her notebook. "Keep taking the medication I prescribed last time. And think about the questions I asked you."

He nodded in acknowledgment.

After the doctor left, he swallowed a double dose of sleeping pills. It was the first time he'd slept in seven days.

The dream arrived as promised.

This time, he was the one on the black motorcycle.

Stella Valentine stood at the villa's entrance in a cream-colored floral sundress, her long hair fluttering in the breeze. She pouted. "You're late."

He fastened the helmet for her. "I'm taking you to see a tree."

"What's so special about a tree?"

"You'll see."

The tree was breathtaking.

Pink-and-white blossoms bloomed like clouds. Petals rained down in the gentle wind.

"So beautiful..." She pulled out her phone. "Let's take a picture?"

Click—

The flash illuminated the scene.

The towering tree. Her radiant smile. His own happiness. The familiarity of it all felt etched into his bones.

He knew this was a dream.

But he never wanted to wake up.

A shrill ringtone shattered the illusion.

"Hello?"

"Adrian, it's Wendy Evans."

"Who?"

"Your fiancée!" Her voice turned sharp. "Are you really calling off the engagement?"

He rubbed his temples. "We've already discussed this."

"I can change!" Wendy pleaded. "I won't interfere with your life anymore. You can do whatever you want."

Adrian scoffed. "So desperate to marry me?"

"Of course!" She didn't hesitate. "You're handsome and rich. That's all I care about."

"But I could never love you."

"I know!" Wendy rushed on. "You're hung up on someone else—that 'relative' at the bridal shop, right? I don't care. I just want to be Mrs. Roland."

His expression darkened. "Not happening."

"Why not?"

"Women always push their luck." He ended the call.

The dream was gone for good.

The sleeping pills granted him a few fitful hours.

The next morning, his secretary Penny Anderson handed him the schedule, dark circles under her eyes. "Mr. Roland, Wendy harassed me all night—"

"Get to the point."

"She wants you to attend a concert with her. Says it's a farewell gesture." Penny hesitated. "She's trying to gain fame as an influencer."

Adrian massaged his temples. "We'll see."

...

Dusk always carried melancholy.

Stella closed the last email—still no matching liver donor.

Out of 1.4 billion people, not one compatible match.

Joy Fairsprene's call came at the right moment. "Have you considered asking Adrian for help?"

"When is Harry Vance's concert?"

"This Sunday." Joy hesitated. "You're really going?"

"Just for a change of scenery," she murmured.

On Sunday evening, Stella arrived at the stadium early.

Harry's popularity had skyrocketed. The crowd outside was massive.

"Here for the concert too?" A girl offered her a glowing headband.

As Stella accepted it, murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Look! Who's that?"

"Not Harry, but wow...so handsome..."
###Chapter 237: Between a Rock and a Hard Place

The young female fans quickly got distracted by the commotion nearby and surged toward the side entrance.

The previously jam-packed corridor emptied in an instant.

With half an hour left before the concert—just enough time.

She strode through the stadium gates. Staff bustled about, making final adjustments.

Several burly men stood guard outside Harry Vance's dressing room, roughly shooing away girls wearing light-up headbands.

"Sir, we just wanted to deliver fan letters..."

"Get lost!"

"Could you at least pass them along—"

"One more word and you'll regret it!"

The girls trembled, placing a thick stack of envelopes by the door before fleeing in tears. "We left the letters here, Harry!"

The security guards raised their fists threateningly, sending the girls scrambling.

"Which department are you with?"

Stella Valentine startled at the voice behind her. "I—"

"Oh, the new makeup artist? You're late! Harry's been waiting!"

Before she could react, someone yanked her wrist and dragged her inside. Recognizing the escort, the guards let them pass without question.

Stella bent to pick up the discarded letters.

"Harry!"

The dressing room was hazy with smoke. Harry Vance didn't look up from his video game, cigarette dangling from his lips. "Fans all gone?"

"Makeup artist is here!"

Harry spun around—then choked violently, ash scattering across his lap.

Stella froze. His face bore obvious surgical enhancements, but the work looked unnatural, leaving his features puffy and stiff.

"...You're the makeup artist?"

"No."

"Then why are you here?" His expression darkened. "Did Joy send you?"

"Let's talk about the child."

Harry crushed his cigarette. "Impossible! With my current popularity, surgery is out of the question!"

"No room for negotiation?"

"Miss Valentine, out of respect for our past, I'll let this slide. But regarding that child, we're square."

The staff immediately tensed, watching her warily.

Stella glanced at the room full of bodyguards and smiled. "Fine. Then I'll enjoy the concert."

She waved her ticket and walked out calmly.

Lines had formed at the ticket gates. Finding her seat, she checked emails while waiting.

The concert started an hour late due to the missing makeup artist.

When fireworks exploded onstage and Harry descended from the ceiling, the crowd's screams nearly blew the roof off.

During intermission, Stella slipped away unnoticed.

She intercepted Harry outside the restrooms.

"Two choices," she blocked the door. "Hold it through your performance, or talk to me."

Harry gritted his teeth. With people constantly passing by, a scene would draw unwanted attention.

"I can't even risk a hospital visit for a cold right now, let alone surgery!" he hissed. "And my liver's failing!"

"So Celeste's condition is genetic? From you?"

Harry smirked bitterly. "Yes, she got it from me. Happy now?"

"She always asks about her father."

"Tell her she doesn't have one!"

"I did," Stella met his gaze. "I told her he's dead."

Harry's face twisted with rage. "You—"

......

Adrian Roland watched the heavily made-up singer onstage with a frown.

Beside him, Wendy Evans shrieked excitedly, drawing annoyed glances. Several audience members discreetly photographed Adrian's striking profile.

"Mr. Roland," Wendy whispered over the music. "After this concert, we're even."

"I'll transfer the money now."

"But the show isn't over."

As Adrian stood to leave, she grabbed his wrist.

"Let go." He shook her off. "Name your price."
###Chapter 238: How Could Anyone Say That?

"Mr. Roland, I don't want money." Wendy Evans tapped the armrest with her crimson nails. "All my relatives and friends thought I was marrying into wealth. Now that the engagement's canceled, I've become the laughingstock of my entire social circle."

"Name your price."

"What I want is my dignity back." Her red lips curled. "If we're photographed at this concert today, I can tell everyone I was the one who dumped you."

Adrian Roland sneered. "Suit yourself."

"Stay until the show ends, or I'll make a scene at your company." Wendy lowered her voice. "I'll let everyone know what a heartless playboy the great Mr. Roland really is."

Office gossip meant nothing to him.

But his old-fashioned African business partner valued moral character above all. If this scandal blew up, the hundred-million-dollar gemstone deal would collapse.

"I'm going to the restroom." He stood abruptly.

Turning the corridor corner, he heard a familiar female voice.

"Harry Vance, are you even human?"

"Miss Valentine, I told you I never wanted that child."

"Then why sleep with women? Now that the child needs a liver donor, you're just going to abandon them?"

"What man would refuse an easy lay?" Harry scoffed. "I heard Adrian Roland got you pregnant after two nights. If he can walk away, why shouldn't I?"

Stella's voice trembled. "You—"

"Leave or I'll call security." Harry waved impatiently. "That brat's better off dead anyway. Saves me the trouble."

"How could anyone say that?"

"Security!"

Several burly men rushed forward.

Adrian snapped the wrist of the first guard who reached for Stella.

Amid the man's howls, he glared at Harry. "Bullying women. How impressive, Mr. Vance."

Harry paled. "Mr. Roland? Aren't you getting married today? Shouldn't you worry about your bride seeing you with your ex-wife?"

"None of your concern." Adrian yanked Stella toward the exit.

The car door slammed shut.

Stella gave a bitter smile. In three days back in Houston, this was already the second time he'd shoved her into a vehicle.

"Explain." He locked the doors.

"What?"

"That child." Adrian's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "I thought it belonged to 'Mr. Alistair.' Turns out it's Harry Vance's? You really aren't picky."

"It's not what you think."

"Then what? Friends with benefits?" His voice rose sharply. "I waited until marriage to touch you, but you'd spread your legs for trash like—"

"Adrian Roland!" she cut in sharply. "Watch your language."

"Your actions don't deserve polite words."

"Open the door. I'm leaving."

"Not a chance."

Stella shook with anger. "We've been divorced for three years! Who I'm with is none of your business! Did I say one word about your wedding?"

"I just regret wasting over a decade on you."

"The feeling's mutual." Her laugh was icy. "All those years meant less to you than Lily Savigny."

Adrian rolled down the window violently, reaching for a cigarette before remembering her lung condition. He hurled the pack outside.

"Wasn't today your wedding?" Stella eyed his all-black attire. "Getting married in this? Ms. Evans has unique tastes."

"Uniquely shameless," he mocked.

In the rearview mirror, his sharp profile was tense. The tall bridge of his nose cast shadows, his thin lips pressed into a hard line.

Deafening screams erupted from the stadium.

"Who actually listens to this caterwauling?" Adrian sneered. "And some woman actually bred with that garbage."

"Go back." Her voice softened. "Don't keep Ms. Evans waiting."

"I don't need your advice."

"Then let me out."

"How are you saving that child?" He turned abruptly.

Stella froze.

"Consider it making up for Ethan." His tone was gruff. "Needs a liver transplant? Neither you nor Harry are matches?"

"Harry has liver disease—it's genetic. As for me..." Her lashes lowered. "I'm not biologically related to her."

Adrian choked. "She's not yours?"
###Chapter 239: Why Are You Looking at Me with Such Sadness?

Stella Valentine remained silent.

"She may not be my biological child, but I raised her since she was little. She is my daughter," she said softly.

For a fleeting moment, she thought she saw Adrian Roland's lips curve into a faint smile, but it disappeared as quickly as it came.

The pain in her wrist brought her back to reality.

It must have been her imagination.

What did he have to be happy about?

He was still worried that her love for Ethan and Luna would be divided.

"Every child is equally important to me," she murmured. "A thirty-year-old man in his prime—if it's not Miss Wendy, it'll be someone else. But Ethan and Luna are my life. I can't lose them."

The concert ended, and fans poured out of the stadium.

Young girls excitedly shared photos of their idol. One lucky fan had managed to take a picture with him and was crying tears of joy.

Youth was beautiful.

They could love recklessly and cry without restraint.

Young love was always so pure and passionate.

But life would eventually wear down their edges. These girls would one day be busy with mundane chores and family responsibilities. Tonight would become a cherished memory.

And what about her?

She had given all her youth to Adrian.

After finally escaping and meeting Mr. Alistair, she thought she had found a new beginning.

But fate had nailed shut even that last window of hope.

The little hope Mr. Alistair had left her was cruelly snatched away.

A sharp pain suddenly shot through her abdomen.

The memory of cold surgical instruments resurfaced, crushing her last shred of hope.

"Little Star?" Adrian leaned over, touching the cold sweat on her forehead. "Are you in pain? Is it your old illness acting up again?"

No.

She had once thought the pain of cancer was unbearable.

Until that rainy night three years ago, when she knelt on the floor of a foreign hospital, begging, only to be forcibly wheeled into the operating room.

That was when she realized—

There was pain worse than death.

"Let's go to the hospital," he said, reaching to carry her.

Stella pulled away. "Let me out."

"Stop being stubborn."

"If I hadn't been stubborn, I wouldn't have survived this long," she said, her voice trembling. "Ethan would have died overseas, and you would never have known you had a son!"

Adrian gave a bitter smile. "You hate me."

"My heart is too small. There's only room for one person."

His eyes darkened. "You won't even spare hatred for me, is that it?"

As the pain gradually faded, she replied calmly, "Yes."

"Even if he's dead, you'll remember him forever?"

"Yes."

"What about Victor?"

"We're just friends."

"Why accept him but reject me?" His voice tightened. "If we're both insignificant, why the difference?"

Stella whispered, "Because the motorcycle he rides... Mr. Alistair rode one just like it."

"That's the only reason?"

"That's the only reason."

Adrian laughed at himself. "Losing to a dead man, I can accept. But losing to a motorcycle..."

Silence filled the car.

She looked up at him.

His tall frame seemed cramped in the confined space. The once-arrogant CEO now looked utterly defeated.

And the way he lowered his gaze reminded her so much of Mr. Alistair.

"Little Star," he suddenly looked up, "why are you looking at me like that?"

She averted her eyes in a panic. "You're imagining things."

"Am I?"

"Yes."

Adrian slumped back into the driver's seat and unlocked the door. "Go."

Her hand rested on the door handle.

"That child..." he suddenly said, "I'll find a way."

"..."

"Ethan and Luna have been raised well by you. If Grandpa sees them, his condition might improve."

"What's wrong with Grandpa Edward?"

"Old illness. He's been bedridden since he found out about our divorce." His voice was hoarse. "I moved back to the old house to take care of him. All of this... is my fault."

Stella's heart ached.

"I'll bring the children to see him."

A shrill phone ring suddenly pierced the air.

Adrian answered. "Benjamin?"

"Young master! The old master saw you with another woman on TV and had a fit!"

The car was so quiet Stella could hear every word clearly.

"Did you call an ambulance?"

"It's already on the way! Go straight to the hospital!"

Before hanging up, Benjamin sighed. "The old master has been depressed about the young mistress. Even if you're seeing someone else, did you have to make it public...?"

"It's my fault."

Adrian gripped the steering wheel, glancing at her through the rearview mirror. "Are you leaving?"

"..."

"If you're leaving, get out now. If not, stay put."

He closed his eyes and waited.

The expected sound of the door opening never came. Instead, he heard her soft voice say, "Drive."
###Chapter 240: Please, Just This Once

The ambulance siren pierced through the night sky.

The hospital was only ten minutes from the stadium, while the Roland family estate lay on the outskirts of the city.

By the time Stella Valentine arrived, the emergency room lights were already on.

Benjamin Langley slumped on the hallway bench, his hands trembling uncontrollably. "The doctor said... the old master can't survive more than three more attacks like this..."

Adrian Roland stood by the window, the cigarette between his fingers burned down to the filter.

"Young master!" Benjamin suddenly grabbed his arm. "What's wrong with little Stella? That woman on TV—"

"Benjamin." Adrian stubbed out the cigarette. "It's not what you think."

"Then what is it?" Tears streamed down the old man's wrinkled face. "The master keeps talking about his great-grandchildren, saying he failed Stella. Young master, for his sake—"

"Miss Valentine?"

Benjamin's head snapped up, his cloudy eyes suddenly brightening. "Stella! You and the young master—"

Before she could respond, a hand closed around her wrist.

Adrian pulled her into an alcove, his voice barely above a whisper. "I need a favor."

"What?"

"In front of Grandpa..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Pretend we've reconciled."

Stella frowned.

"The doctor said..." His voice cracked. "He doesn't have much time left."

At the end of the hallway, Benjamin stood on tiptoe, hope shining in his eyes.

Stella remembered how Mr. Edward Roland's hands always trembled when he saw the children.

He was Mr. Alistair's grandfather.

"Fine." Her response came abruptly. "But I have conditions."

Adrian's eyes lit up. "Name them."

"Find me a matching liver donor." She held his gaze. "No empty promises."

"I swear." The answer came instantly. "I'll bankrupt myself if I have to."

She nodded, then caught a familiar scent.

"You changed your cologne?"

Adrian adjusted his tie. "Smoking more lately. Needed something stronger."

"Miss Evans doesn't like the smell?"

"Don't know." His expression turned indifferent. "Not worth remembering trivial things about unimportant people."

Stella pressed her lips together. "That's unfair to her."

"Fairness was never what she wanted." Suddenly, he extended his hand, palm up. "May I?"

His fingers trembled slightly.

When Stella placed her hand in his, both froze at the contact.

His palm was drenched in sweat.

"Nervous?" she asked.

Adrian gave a humorless smile. "Afraid you'd change your mind."

Benjamin nearly collapsed to his knees when he saw them walking back hand in hand. "Heaven has eyes!"

The emergency lights finally dimmed.

The doctor removed his mask. "The blockage in Mr. Roland's arteries is severe, but he's too old for surgery. One more episode and..."

Benjamin bowed repeatedly.

"He's awake." The doctor glanced at them. "Family may see him now."

Machines beeped rhythmically in the sterile room.

Edward Roland opened his eyes weakly, his gaze landing on their joined hands.

Tears welled in the old man's wrinkled eyes, tracking down his weathered cheeks.

Stella's nose stung unexpectedly.

A frail, needle-marked hand strained toward them.
###Chapter 241: Your Eyes Don't Lie

The golden glow of sunset streamed through the glass window, outlining Adrian Roland's profile with a radiant halo.

He leaned slightly forward, meeting her at eye level.

"Stella, I've waited too long for this day."

His voice trembled slightly as cigarette ash scattered from his fingertips.

"If you agree, there's no turning back."

Suddenly, Mr. Alistair's voice echoed in her memory—equally tender, equally restrained, with the same subtle inclination of his body.

If not for the difference in their voices...

"Little Star?"

Stella Valentine snapped back to reality, the light in her eyes dimming. "Let's go."

Inside the hospital room, nurses were checking old Mr. Roland's blood pressure.

"The patient can't be moved yet. We'll transfer him to a regular ward once his readings stabilize."

"I refuse to stay!" The elderly man's booming voice filled the room.

Adrian motioned for the nurses to leave.

"Grandfather."

"Get out! Marry whoever you want from now on!"

Adrian tightened his grip on Stella's hand. "I brought your granddaughter-in-law to see you."

"No!"

"Really?"

"Are you deaf?"

Adrian pretended to turn away. "Then we'll leave first."

The old man abruptly sat up. His eyes brightened at the sight of Stella, then narrowed approvingly when he noticed their joined hands. "Little Star's back?"

Stella seized the chance to withdraw her hand and approached the bed. "Grandfather Edward."

"Where are the children?"

"At home. I'll bring them to visit after you're discharged."

The elder immediately threw off his blanket. "I'm leaving now!"

"You should stay for observation," Adrian advised.

Stella added softly, "The kids are too energetic. Let's wait until you've recovered."

The previously irate old man nodded obediently.

Benjamin Langley chuckled nearby. "Feeling better now, sir?"

Suddenly, the elder grasped Stella's hand anxiously. "You're not leaving again, are you?"

She stiffened. "I might have to return after handling some matters."

"Make that rascal help you!" He glared at Adrian. "And what's this nonsense about another woman in the news?"

Stella produced concert ticket stubs. "A misunderstanding. We attended together."

Only then did the old man relax, scolding Adrian again. "Remember you're a married man!"

"I know."

"Knowing isn't enough!" He turned to Stella. "If he mistreats you again, I'll set him straight!"

Her voice softened. "I'll always be your granddaughter-in-law."

The elder's eyes reddened. "Good child..."

Noticing his fatigue, Benjamin escorted them to the door. "Visit more often when you can."

"She's busy. I'll come alone," Adrian said.

Stella immediately countered, "No need for assistance."

The atmosphere between them chilled instantly.

Once Benjamin left, Stella quickly stepped back. "The act's over. About the liver donor—"

Adrian raised an eyebrow. "Do I have thorns?"

"Distance benefits us both."

He suddenly closed the gap between them. "Your eyes betrayed you earlier."

"You imagined it."

"When you said you'd always be Grandfather's granddaughter-in-law—what did you mean?"

Stella turned to leave but was yanked back.

Their elongated shadows tangled in the sunset glow, mirroring the complicated ties that bound them together.
###Chapter 242: Do You Love Him That Much?

"Because..."

Because of the wedding beneath the crabapple blossoms. Because of the ring on her finger. Because she was Mr. Alistair's lawfully wedded wife.

Mr. Alistair was Edward Roland's grandson. She would always be a Roland.

"Because what?" Adrian pressed, stepping closer.

"None of your business." Stella turned away. "This is just a transaction. I agreed to play along for Celeste's sake—"

"For the child who needs a liver transplant. I know." His lips curved into a faint smile. "Whatever the reason, I'm glad we're standing together again. Don't worry. I've mobilized all resources to find a matching donor."

"Thank you."

"Stella, must we be so distant?"

She met his gaze squarely. "This is the distance we should keep. Adrian, I have no lingering feelings for you. None at all. What we had ended long ago. My heart belongs to someone else now. Everything I said earlier was just part of the act. Don't mistake it for anything more."

His smile froze.

"All an act?"

"Yes."

He laughed bitterly. "Fine. If you say it's an act, then it is. Get in the car. I'll take you back."

"No need—"

"Grandfather is watching from upstairs." Adrian gripped her wrist firmly. "If we're acting, let's commit to the role."

Stella glanced up at the hospital windows. The glare of sunlight obscured any figures behind the glass.

Before she could protest, he ushered her into the passenger seat. He leaned over to fasten her seatbelt, his movements practiced—as if he'd done it a thousand times before.

The engine hummed to life. Silence settled between them.

"You changed cars?" Stella studied the familiar Maybach interior. "I remember you only drove Porsches." The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them. "Unless it's Wendy's preference. Forget I asked."

"Has nothing to do with her." His hand rested lightly on the steering wheel. "Just felt like trying something new."

"From a Porsche to a Maybach. Quite the leap."

"People change." His tone was flat. "Like how I never wore cologne before. Now I find eau de Cologne rather agreeable."

Her pulse jumped. "Do you... know something?"

"What should I know?"

"About Mr. Alistair."

Adrian gave a humorless smile. "Aside from your descriptions, I don't even know what he looked like. Until yesterday, I thought Victor Valence was 'Mr. Alistair.'"

She bit her lip.

The cologne. The Maybach. Could they really be coincidences?

"Why ask?" He glanced sideways. "Is there... something I should know?"

"No reason."

"That man—did he die overseas? Illness or accident?"

"Domestic. An accident."

"Is he buried in the same cemetery as your father?"

"I don't know where he's buried." Her voice trembled. "But I'll find out."

"From his family?"

"From his benefactor."

Adrian frowned. "Forgive my bluntness, but this 'Mr. Alistair' sounds highly suspicious. Appears out of nowhere, vanishes without a trace—not even a confirmed gravesite. Almost like an elaborate disappearing act..."

"What did you say?" Her head snapped up.

"Just theorizing." His eyes remained on the road. "He gains your trust, then conveniently dies in an 'accident' with no body to recover. You... didn't give him anything of value, did you?"

Stella let out a cold laugh. "Adrian, what exactly are you implying? I left our marriage with nothing—couldn't even afford surgery. What could he possibly have taken from me?"

"I only wanted to—"

"You have no right to question him!" she cut in sharply.

He studied her, his gaze heavy with self-mockery. "Do you love him that much?"

"Absolutely."

"More than you ever loved me?"

Stella held his stare. "Like you said—that was the past. There's a phrase for it: 'hindsight is 20/20.'"

The silence stretched until the car halted before the hotel.

She pushed the door open. Adrian's weary voice followed her: "...I understand."

Without turning back, she strode to the elevators. Only when the doors closed did the tension leave her body.

The mirror showed a face nearly unchanged from three years ago—just thinner. Mr. Alistair had once filled out her cheeks; grief hollowed them again. Her mother's care had recently restored some color.

The children were still waiting for their father to come home...

Fingers touched warm wetness. Only then did she realize she was crying.

Mr. Alistair, I almost mistook someone for you again today.

But just for a second.

It's alright if the world never knew you existed.

I remember.

Always.

——

Adrian returned straight to the office.

Wendy's breakup demands had cost him a full workday.

Though past business hours, New Frontier Group's employees still labored—a company culture upheld by generous overtime pay.

He found Penny Anderson dozing at her desk.

"Mr. Roland!" She jolted awake at his knock.

He moved to his desk. "Report."

After summarizing the day's affairs, she arranged documents for signing. Atop the pile lay a memo penned in elegant calligraphy.

"Unidentified visitor?" His finger paused on one entry.

"An elderly gentleman in a wheelchair, accompanied by a disabled man." Penny recalled. "He insisted you contact him immediately. Quite aggressive—demanded access to your office! As your secretary, I had to—"

"Leave."

"Pardon?"

"Now."

As Penny scurried out, Adrian dialed a number.

"Adrian." Xavier Atlante's voice crackled through.

"Uncle Xavier. You were looking for me?"

"What do you think?" The old man's snort was icy.
###Chapter 243: Her Heart Belonged to Another

Adrian Roland's slender fingers glided across his phone screen as he skimmed through the quarterly report Penny Anderson had just delivered. The numbers were impressive—company performance steadily climbing.

"Uncle Xavier..."

"Are you serious about that Miss Evans?"

"No." Adrian's reply was curt.

"Then why attend a concert with her? It trended online!" The old man's tone turned sharp. "Women will only hinder your career. You said marrying her was just for business—"

Adrian loosened his tie irritably, grateful this was a phone call.

"We've broken up. Today's wedding was canceled. I didn't cross any lines."

Xavier's voice softened slightly. "You went to a concert after breaking up?"

"It was part of the terms."

"Good." A contemplative pause. "You already have children. No need for more. As for the gemstone supplier...just go through the motions. That new secretary of yours seems suitable. Dismiss her after the deal."

"Her financial situation is precarious. Abrupt termination—"

"Sentimental weakness!"

"It's basic decency."

Xavier scoffed. "Still clinging to illusions about women? Stella Valentine moved on the moment she left you. Only you dwell on the past."

"Uncle!" Adrian's voice sharpened. "Let's discuss business."

A weighted silence. "You've seen Stella?"

"She's the children's mother."

"Having second thoughts?"

"I'm fulfilling my paternal duties." Adrian massaged his temples. "I won't forget what I owe you. But other matters...let them go."

Xavier's breathing grew ragged. "She doesn't love you anymore."

"I know."

"Her heart belongs to someone else."

"...I know."

"And you still persist?"

A bitter laugh escaped Adrian. "Rest assured—she won't even look at me."

———

9:00 PM. Penny tiptoed into the office balancing a coffee cup.

By the floor-to-ceiling window, a dozen cigarette butts littered the floor around Adrian. The acrid smoke made her cough. "Mr. Roland, should I order supper?"

"No."

"The coffee—"

"Leave it."

Penny's gaze flickered to the overflowing ashtray. Three packs today.

"Any other tasks?" she ventured.

Adrian stubbed out his cigarette. "Why are you still here?"

She suppressed an eye-roll. Interns didn't clock out on time.

"In case you needed anything."

He grabbed his jacket. "Drive me home."

Penny's second time handling the Maybach. Rolling down windows barely alleviated the haze.

"Close them." The command came from the backseat.

She pursed her lips. Chauffeur duty plus secondhand smoke—only the salary made it tolerable.

"Which address, sir?"

"369 Peach Grove Road."

"That far?"

Adrian leaned back, eyes shut. He'd prefer somewhere closer, but insomnia was routine now.

"Your name?"

"...Penny Anderson."

"Miss Anderson," he asked abruptly, "am I difficult?"

She nearly bit her tongue. "Of course not! It's an honor to—"

"The truth."

"...A little."

A faint chuckle. "Then why stay?"

"The pay." Raw honesty. "I'm searching for someone."

"Boyfriend?"

"Yeah." Her voice dipped. "He said he fell for someone else. Told me not to look for him."

Adrian stiffened. The phrasing was hauntingly familiar.

"How long were you together?"

"Over a decade." Her grip tightened on the wheel. "I don't believe he changed."

"What if...he truly loves another?"

"Then I'll become better than her. Win him back."

"Become better..." Adrian echoed pensively.

"And when he returns—" Penny suddenly gritted her teeth, "I'll dump him! Let him taste his own medicine!"

"Could you?"

"..." Her voice faltered. "Just a decade-long relationship."

Adrian turned to the window. "Know the final move of Dragon Subduing technique?"

"Overbearing Dragon Regrets?"

"Yes." Barely audible. "Some actions...bring instant remorse."
###Chapter 244: Do I Resemble Him?

Penny's hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel.

She stole a glance at Mr. Roland through the rearview mirror. The man sat like a statue, eyes closed, his breathing so faint it was almost inaudible.

"Mr. Roland, what does 'Overbearing Dragon Regrets' actually mean?"

Adrian didn't even lift an eyelid. "You wouldn't understand even if I explained."

Penny pouted. "Knew you'd say that. Well, us ordinary folks only care about today's overtime pay—three hundred bucks."

The car cut through the night.

Streetlights flickered like discarded fireflies outside the window.

"We're here," Penny whispered.

Adrian opened his eyes. The darkened windows of the old house stared back like hollow eyes.

"Take me to the hotel," he said abruptly.

Penny nearly bit her tongue. "Huh?"

"Five percent bonus."

"On it!" She floored the accelerator.

The fountain at Houston Grand Hotel shimmered under the night sky.

Adrian watched the water for three seconds before turning to Penny.

"That pretty lady stays here," Penny said with a wink. "Room 0826."

His gaze sharpened like a blade.

"Can I be honest, Mr. Roland?" Penny shrank slightly. "You like her."

"Shut up."

"Glaring won't change my mind! She's way better than Miss Wendy. Wouldn't she make a great boss's wife?"

Adrian slammed the car door and strode off.

Penny chased after him, shoving a bottle of cologne into his hands. "Gotta smell good when chasing girls!"

Then she vanished.

Adrian stood in the wind, letting the night air scatter the smoke clinging to him. The citrus-and-alcohol scent of the cologne reminded him of a rainy evening long ago.

As the elevator numbers climbed, Penny's words echoed in his ears:

"I'll do better than him. Make him fall for me again."

What made Mr. Alistair so special?

His gentleness? Thoughtfulness? Or that he'd never hurt her?

Adrian clenched his fists. Everything he could offer, Mr. Alistair had already given. The only difference? He'd been the one to push her into the abyss.

Had that car crash truly been an accident?

Why the day before the wedding?

Why did the Valentine family's assets all end up in Victor's hands?

Too many inconsistencies, woven together like a carefully crafted web.

Back then, he'd been a rabid beast, turning his sharpest claws against the one he loved most. Now, every memory was a knife twisting in his chest.

Ding.

The eighth floor.

Childish laughter spilled from Room 0826. Ethan's goodnight, Luna's sweet whining, and her voice weaving a fairy tale.

"...the prince rescued the princess, and they lived happily ever after."

"Is Mommy the princess?"

"Mommy's prince... won't be coming back."

Adrian's heart constricted violently.

"Daddy promised to protect us!" Luna's voice grew suddenly closer.

A knock sounded at the door. Adrian held his breath.

The door swung open without warning.

In the warm hallway light, little Luna barreled into his arms like a cannonball. And there, standing in the shadows—her, eyes glistening with tears.

"...Mr. Alistair?"

The name was a dagger to his heart.

He scooped up his daughter, kicked the door shut behind him. In the darkness, he closed in on her trembling figure, voice rough:

"Do I look that much like him?"
###Chapter 245: He Wanted You All Along

That voice...

It was identical to Mr. Alistair's from her memories.

Stella Valentine froze.

She couldn't tell who stood before her now.

Or perhaps, she refused to.

The moment he spoke those words, the truth became undeniable.

"Daddy!" Luna Roland happily threw herself into the man's arms, nuzzling against his neck. "You're finally back! Mommy was getting worried."

Adrian Roland caught his daughter effortlessly, but his gaze remained fixed on Stella.

"Still awake at this hour?"

"I was waiting for you." Luna tilted her tiny face up, her voice sweet and childish. "Ethan said you went to fight bad guys. I was so scared."

Adrian's heart softened.

Daughters were different from sons.

His son admired him, saw him as a role model. But his daughter only cared if he would come home unharmed.

"Daddy is strong." He patted her back gently. "See? I'm perfectly fine."

Luna turned to her mother. "Daddy, can you hug Mommy too?"

The air turned heavy.

Stella instinctively took half a step back.

Adrian's eyes darkened. "Mommy doesn't need Daddy's hugs."

Confused, Luna blinked but soon drifted to sleep in her father's warm embrace.

"Have a seat." Stella broke the silence. "Would you like something to drink?"

Adrian was surprised.

He expected her to shut him out like she had during the day.

"No, thank you."

She had already poured a glass of water and set it on the coffee table. "You have stomach problems. Cut back on coffee."

"You remember?"

"Penny told me." Her tone was flat. "Did you eat dinner?"

Adrian shook his head.

"I thought so." Stella turned toward the kitchen. "Penny texted that you skipped your meal."

He gave a bitter smile. "I just didn't want to burden you with two kids to care for."

"Mom and Joy are helping. You don't need to worry."

The clatter of cooking utensils came from the kitchen.

Five minutes later, she returned with a plate of golden fried rice.

"Make do with this."

Adrian took the plate and devoured the food.

"Slow down." Stella frowned. "No one's taking it from you."

"It's delicious." He looked up, his eyes bright. "Better than any Michelin three-star meal."

Stella turned away, standing in the shadows.

"Stella." Adrian set down his plate. "There's something I need to tell you."

"Hmm?"

"I've spent three years thinking." He took a deep breath. "That car crash was too suspicious. Victor Lefèvre and Sophia Durand couldn't have orchestrated something that elaborate."

Stella arched an eyebrow. "What about your first love, Lily Savigny?"

"Back then..." Adrian ran a hand through his hair. "I wasn't in my right mind. Looking back now, Lily always appeared when I was agitated. She might have been drugging me."

"You're saying..."

"There's someone else behind the crash." Adrian's gaze burned with intensity. "Their target wasn't New Frontier Group."

"Then what was it?"

"You."

Stella's pupils contracted sharply.

"Mr. Alistair appeared far too conveniently." Adrian spoke each word deliberately. "Without that crash, we would have married the next day. He wanted to tear us apart—just to have you for himself."
###Chapter 246: The Boundaries of Self-Respect

"......"

"He orchestrated everything. Exploited our misunderstandings, took advantage of Lily Savigny and my illness, then extended a helping hand when you were at your weakest..."

Stella Valentine's fingers clenched abruptly, her nails digging deep into her palms. "Adrian Roland, after all this, you're just trying to tell me Mr. Alistair was a scheming liar?"

"I'm merely stating facts," Adrian's voice was hoarse. "How else would you explain how intimately he knew everything about you?"

"Enough!" Stella's voice cut through the night like a blade. "He's gone. A dead man can't even defend himself."

"Stella..."

"If you came here just to say these things, you can leave now."

Adrian remained rooted in place. Moonlight traced the tense line of his jaw. "...Fine. I won't say anymore."

Stella turned toward the window, her weary profile reflected in the glass.

She hadn't forcefully kicked him out.

The realization sent a flicker of emotion through Adrian's chest. He smiled bitterly to himself. When had not being despised by her become a luxury?

"Let me stay a little longer. Please."

Her back remained rigid. "...Do what you want."

"You're in a good mood today?"

"What?"

"You didn't throw me out."

Stella suddenly turned. "Your voice..."

"Too many cigarettes." He instinctively touched his throat. "Does it bother you?"

"No." Her gaze lingered on his Adam's apple. "Does it always sound like this after you smoke?"

"Three years clean. Broke that today." His smile was rueful. "Had some... complications."

Stella gave a slight nod but didn't press further.

Adrian suddenly stepped closer. "So, was it the voice? Is that why you let me stay?"

"......"

"Stella, you still have feelings for me, don't you?"

"Don't flatter yourself." She retreated half a step. "I just didn't want to wake the children."

The light in his eyes dimmed. "I see."

"We've been divorced for three years. I don't want my presence to affect you and Wendy Evans—"

"The wedding's canceled." He cut her off. "Mutual convenience. Nothing to do with you."

"You knew she had ulterior motives and still agreed to marry her?"

Adrian opened his mouth but remained silent. The situation with the South African gem dealer was too complicated—explaining would only sound like excuses.

Stella didn't press further. Under the starlight, the man's silhouette overlapped with her memories—broad shoulders, a sharp jawline, and those fathomless eyes.

Reason told her to send him away, but her body betrayed her will.

This familiar scene, this familiar voice...

Her final memories of Mr. Alistair had blurred. Her mind had blocked out the gruesome details of the car crash, leaving only fragments: Grant Rubenstein's cane, Mr. Xavier Atlante's walnuts, and the glaring pool of blood.

"Stella?"

"What?"

"That look in your eyes..."

She averted her gaze as if burned. "...Sorry."

"You never have to apologize to me."

The words struck her like lightning. Stella's head snapped up. "Say that again."

"You never—"

"Again."

Adrian frowned. "You're pale."

She pushed away his outstretched hand. "I'm fine."

"Because of my voice... and those words." Understanding dawned, turning his voice gravelly. "They reminded you of him, didn't they?"

Silence stretched between them.

"I get it now." Adrian's shoulders slumped. "Stella, you're right. I'm jealous."

"......"

"Jealous enough to go mad." His smile was bitter. "But how can the living compete with the dead? The deceased are always perfect."

"Have you been drinking?"

"No."

"You're talking too much."

"Annoying you?"

"...Yes."

Adrian dragged a hand down his face. "Fine. I'll stop. Thank you for giving me closure today. The deal stands—I'll keep searching for a liver donor for the children. As for Grandfather..."

"I know."

"Then I'll go."

Stella suddenly called out, "Wait."

"Yes?"

"The kids..." Her voice tightened. "Ethan misses you. So does Luna. You can... stay longer."

Adrian laughed, but his eyes remained hollow. "Stella, I have my pride too."

"What?"

"You're missing him." He took a step back. "But I won't be anyone's substitute."
###Chapter 247: Waking from the Dream

Stella Valentine once adored the night.

As a girl, she'd lean on her windowsill awaiting dusk. Adrian Roland would pedal his bicycle beneath her window right on schedule, arms outstretched. "Little star, jump."

His seventeen-year-old arms never faltered. They'd sneak to the osmanthus grove beyond the estate, night winds carrying sweetness as he whisked her through moonlight.

Then she met Mr. Alistair.

The man who embraced her in darkness, his warmth banishing every fear. "Don't be afraid," he'd murmur. "I'm here."

Now nights held only biting cold.

No one caught her when she fell. No hands soothed her trembling back. That warmth had been a mirage—waking left only frost in its wake.

Morning light stabbed her eyes when the video call arrived.

Hugo Merovingian rubbed his shadowed eyes. "Sorry for the hour. But this little empress won't settle..."

A child's wails pierced through. Stella winced. "I'll return soon."

"Any progress with Celeste's marrow donor?"

Her smile stiffened. "They withdrew."

"What?" Hugo jerked upright. "After signing the agreement?"

"Life plans changed." She smoothed her expression. "I'll find another way."

"Harry Vance—"

"Would celebrate if Celeste vanished." Her laugh held ice. "I should've known."

Hugo's fist hit the desk. "That bastard!" Then softer, "Don't overextend yourself. Without you adopting her..."

"But she calls me Mommy." The words caught in her throat.

Before disconnecting, Hugo blurted, "I'm seeing someone." His screen flashed a beaming girl—sunshine personified.

At Brilliant Star Group, a manager wrung his hands. "Victor Lefèvre's been on the roof all night demanding you."

Elevator doors slid shut. "After New Frontier Group poached our clients, we're stuck with budget orders..."

Sixth floor. Victor's curses erupted. "Stella's a viper! Stabbing her own uncle!"

One leg dangled over the railing. Employees below stood paralyzed.

"Clear the floor." Stella unbuttoned her blazer. "I'll handle this."
###Chapter 248: A Lesson from My Husband

The manager hurried out of the office, waving for all employees to leave immediately.

Three years had carved deep lines into Victor Lefèvre.

His suit was faded, with grease stains near the collar. Beneath his unkempt hair was a haggard face, the wrinkles at his eyes far deeper than she remembered.

"Finally decided to show up?" His voice was hoarse.

Stella Valentine pulled over a swivel chair and sat. "When my uncle threatens to jump, I should at least see him off."

Victor slammed the desk. "I should've listened to Sophia! Transferred all the shares to her!"

Stella shook her head lightly. "And now? Where did all your money go?"

His face stiffened.

"Lily Savigny still spends lavishly, while you can't even afford a decent suit."

"Bullshit!" Victor roared, leaping to his feet. "Sophia wouldn't abandon me! Unlike you, you ungrateful wretch!"

Stella checked her watch. "Jump quickly. The police will be here soon."

"You—"

"The sixth floor won't kill you, but it'll make headlines." Her tone was calm. "Perfect for everyone to see how the former chairman of Shi's Jewelry tried to blackmail his niece."

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Victor peered over the windowsill. The airbag was inflating below. After adjusting his stance several times, he finally gritted his teeth and jumped.

"Someone jumped!"
"Call an ambulance!"
"He landed on the airbag..."

By the time Stella took the elevator down, a crowd had gathered.

"Miss Valentine, please cooperate with our investigation." An officer showed his badge.

She stepped into the patrol car without resistance, instructing the manager who chased after her, "Business as usual."

The door slammed shut.

......

In the interrogation room, Victor stormed in with his arm in a sling. "Officer! She's the culprit!"

The recording officer frowned. "Mr. Lefèvre, you only have minor abrasions."

"But she forced me to jump!" He pointed at Stella. "She stole my company!"

The officer turned to Stella. "Miss Valentine, do you have anything to say?"

"First, let me ask," Stella interlaced her fingers, "what's the penalty for embezzling an inheritance?"

The officer paused. "It depends on the amount..."

"Eight years ago when my father died, this 'wonderful uncle' took everything." She opened her phone gallery. "Here's the stock certificate from back then."

Victor paled. "Lies! It was legal inheritance!"

"Oh?" Stella smiled faintly. "Then explain why you destroyed this paternity test report?"

The officer took the phone, his expression growing stern.

"I'd like to formally file a report." Stella stood. "To reclaim all embezzled assets, including 51% of Shi's Jewelry's shares."

Victor lunged at her. "The company's in crisis now! A scandal will ruin everyone!"

"Perfect." She sidestepped him. "My husband once said, a festering wound must be lanced to heal."

The officer nodded thoughtfully. "Your husband is very wise."

"He always..."

"I'm here."

A familiar voice came from the doorway. Adrian Roland leaned against the frame, his tall frame accentuated by a black trench coat.

He said, "Let's go home, Stella."
###Chapter 249: Predestined Salvation

"Victor..."

Victor pressed a finger to his lips in a silencing gesture. He casually took the documents from the officer, signed with a flourish, then grabbed Stella's wrist and pulled her outside.

The familiar MV Agusta Brutale waited at the police station entrance.

Its jet-black frame gleamed coldly under the sunlight, wild lines blending seamlessly with elegant curves. Tossing her a helmet, Victor flashed a roguish grin. "Daydreaming? Waiting for them to discover our marriage is fake?"

Her knuckles whitened around the helmet straps. "Why did you come?"

"The news exploded," he scoffed. "Victor Lefèvre's little drama ruined your company's carefully built reputation."

"Maybe I never should have—"

"You were born to hold a paintbrush," Victor interrupted. "I still remember your Stellar Whisper collection in Milan. When heaven opens a window, it slams a door—how else would mere mortals survive?"

Stella froze. The man known for his biting sarcasm was... comforting her.

"Thank you."

Victor straddled the bike, impatiently honking. "Want to thank me? Come somewhere with me."

"Where?"

"You'll see."

She took a deep breath and secured the helmet. As the engine roared to life, her arms instinctively circled his waist.

Wind screamed past her ears.

The black beast weaved through traffic. Watching the blurring scenery, Stella's mind drifted back to that rainy night four years ago.

"Mount Rainier?" She stared at the winding mountain road.

Victor removed his helmet, his hair tousled by the alpine wind. "Feeling lucky?"

"Lucky how?"

"With your life," he smirked. "Playing savior for some random kid—Mother Teresa reincarnated?"

Her fingers trembled. "Joy told you?"

"Three drinks in, that idiot nearly disclosed your bra size." His eyes narrowed. "The Huos aren't worth destroying your future."

Mountain gusts whipped her hair.

"Celeste is different."

"How?" Victor sneered. "Her own mother balked at medical bills, yet you volunteer as cash cow?"

Tucking stray strands behind her ear, she whispered, "I can protect her."

"Protect yourself first!" Victor suddenly snapped. "Know what Adrian Roland is doing? Monopolizing Africa's gemstone trade!"

Her phone vibrated.

Stella stiffened. Only one person sent texts now.

"Hand it over." Victor snatched the device. "Package pickup code?"

Her shoulders slumped in relief.

"Important?" He raised an eyebrow.

Eyes reddening, she stared at the screen. "Extremely... important."

"More dead man's relics?" Victor clawed his hair in frustration. "Get on!"

The return ride was faster.

At the courier office, Stella's shaking hands accepted the international parcel. Customs labels swam before her eyes.

Victor frowned at the box. "Joy clearly said—"

Before he finished, Stella was already sprinting into the sunset with her treasure.
###Chapter 250: Please Don't Ask

Stella Valentine tightened her grip around the wooden box in her arms, her knuckles turning white from the pressure.

"What's inside...?"

She shook her head slightly, her eyelashes glistening with unshed tears. "Please don't ask."

Victor Valence ran a frustrated hand through his hair. "Fine, fine. I won't ask. Just—don't cry, okay? I can't handle women crying... Where do you need to go? You look terrible. Should I take you back to the hotel?"

"Can you take me to Mount Rainier?"

"Now?" His eyes widened as he stared at the box. "With that?"

"Yes."

His tone softened. "Why don't we go back and leave it first? The mountain roads are rough. If it gets damaged—"

"I'll hold it tight."

"...Whatever. Get in the car."

"I want to go to the summit."

"Now? It'll be dark by the time we get there!"

Darkness was exactly what she needed.

Stella nodded. "Now."

She cradled the box with both hands while Victor fumbled with her helmet. The young Valence heir had never done this before—the buckle refused to fasten, making him sweat with frustration.

"If I'd known chasing you would be this troublesome," he finally managed to secure the clasp and exhaled in relief, "I'd have stayed single forever."

Stella simply looked at him in silence.

Victor's ears turned red as he hastily explained, "I just thought... raising kids alone must be hard. Being an instant dad doesn't sound bad—stop looking at me like that!"

"I don't need pity," Stella murmured. "This was my choice."

He smacked his own mouth in frustration. "That's not what I meant... After meeting your two kids last time, I suddenly wanted to be a father. Understand?"

Her gaze remained distant, all her focus on the wooden box in her arms.

"Never mind," Victor sighed. "Mount Rainier it is."

By the time they reached the summit, dusk had fallen.

Winter nights came early in Houston. Just past seven, darkness had already swallowed everything around them. Thick clouds blotted out any trace of stars.

After parking, Victor found Stella crouched nearby, digging into the earth with her bare hands. The precious wooden box sat beside her, now smeared with dirt.

He rushed over and grabbed her wrist. "Are you insane? A designer's hands shouldn't be digging in dirt!"

Stella looked up blankly. "I remember a big tree being here..."

"Probably blew down in a storm." Victor pulled her up forcefully. "What are you trying to do?"

"Find a place..."

"What place?"

She shook her head. "I don't know."

Victor snatched the box. "Let's see what's so precious!"

The moment he tore open the wrapping, he froze.

A black urn.

"Is this... Mr. Alistair?"

"No." Her eyes were hollow. "I don't know where he's buried."

"But you two were—"

"Uncle Xavier said," she smiled bitterly, "if I had any conscience left, I wouldn't disturb him."

Victor fell silent.

If not Mr. Alistair, then who?

Her father died young, her mother was alive and well, the children were safe and sound...

Stella knelt beside the urn and pressed a light kiss to it. The wind howled too loudly—he only caught fragments: "Daddy"... "Stella"...

Victor found some branches and quickly dug a small pit.

"Should we put up a marker?"

"No need." She smoothed the last handful of earth over the spot. "This is enough."

Victor stared at the undisturbed ground and finally asked, "Who was he?"
###Chapter 251: Her Heart Already Belonged to Another

Stella Valentine remained silent.

It wasn't that she refused to answer—she simply didn't know how to begin.

The mountain wind suddenly turned violent. Fat raindrops pelted down, stinging against exposed skin.

Victor Valence yanked her onto his motorcycle and swiftly fastened her helmet. "This storm isn't normal. We need to get down now."

"Wait—"

"Wait for what? Do you have any idea how dangerous mountain roads are in the rain? At this altitude, if lightning strikes—"

Boom—

A bolt of lightning split the night sky, followed by deafening thunder.

Without another word, Victor pulled her tight against him and revved the engine, speeding down the treacherous slope.

The downpour became a deluge. The slick roads made the descent agonizingly slow. By the time they found shelter, both were drenched to the bone.

Victor studied Stella's face—her pallid complexion, her tightly pressed lips.

He seized her shoulders. "Stella, what's really going on? You were fine two days ago. Then that package arrived and you've been a ghost of yourself ever since. Who is this person?"

Stella shook her head. "I don't know her name."

"You don't know?"

"No."

"How can you grieve for someone whose name you don't even know?"

Stella lifted her face, wet strands clinging to her cheeks. "Victor, promise me you won't tell anyone about today."

"Are you cold?"

"Promise me."

"I asked if you're cold!"

"...Yes."

Victor glared. "Good. At least you can still feel something." He exhaled sharply. "Relax, I'm not a gossip. There's a convenience store over there. Stay here while I get something hot."

Stella gave a faint nod.

Victor cast one last worried glance before sprinting into the rain.

The store shelves were nearly empty. Victor grabbed random snacks and a disposable cup, insisting the clerk fill it with boiling water.

Through the curtain of rain, he saw Stella standing with her back to him under the awning.

Her slender frame looked heartbreakingly fragile against the storm.

She'd removed her soaked jacket. The white blouse clung to her body, revealing every sharp angle of her underweight form.

Boom—

Another thunderclap shook the ground.

Stella dropped into a crouch, arms wrapped around herself like a terrified child.

Victor's chest constricted. He ran.

......

"Little Star, when will you marry me?"

"Later." She didn't look up from her design sketches.

Adrian Roland knelt beside her, blocking the drafting table. "I'll give you anything you want."

She pouted. "I want a star."

He emptied his pockets of star-shaped candies. "They're all yours."

"These are fake. I want a real one."

"So if I get you a real star, you'll marry me?"

She tilted her chin up. "Liar. How would you even catch a star?"

"As long as you never leave me, I can—"

The memory shattered.

A new vision took its place—Stella stumbling through a storm, barefoot and bleeding, clutching a bloodied infant bundle: "Save her...please..."

Boom—

The thunder rattled the windows.

Adrian jolted awake, his pajamas soaked with sweat.

The nightmare felt horrifyingly real. He remembered her wearing that floral sundress now stained crimson. The baby's swaddle dripping red, rivulets running down Stella's slender arms onto her bare feet...

This was the first night in five years he'd slept in their marital bed.

The empty mansion. The king-sized mattress where Stella had slept alone for half a decade.

Stella...

Adrian froze.

Thunder.

Little Star was terrified of thunderstorms!

He leaped up, grabbing car keys—then halted at the doorway.

Did he even have the right to go to her?

Her heart already belonged to another. She probably never wanted to see him again.

And if she did? Only because his build and smoky voice resembled Mr. Alistair's.

Adrian gave a bitter laugh and returned to bed, lighting a cigarette.

Outside, rain hammered the windows, blurring the streetlights into watery halos.

Adrian Roland—reduced to being someone's stand-in.

The cruelest joke? He'd gladly play the role if it meant being near her.

Smoke burned his lungs, triggering a coughing fit.

Even if he was willing, she wouldn't want him now.

The moment he'd handed her those divorce papers, he'd forfeited all right to protect her.

The phone's shrill ring startled him.

An unknown landline number.

"Hello?"

"Daddy!" Luna's tearful voice trembled through the receiver. "I'm scared..."

"Luna?" Adrian's grip tightened on the phone. "Where's Mommy?"

"Mommy's not here..."

"Are Grandma and Ethan with you?"

"Y-yes..." Luna's crying intensified. "Daddy, did you go fight the bad people? Did the bad people take Mommy?"

Adrian was already sprinting for the garage. "Don't cry, sweetheart. Daddy's going to get Mommy now. Put Grandma on, okay?"

Grace Laurent's exhausted voice came through. "Adrian."

"Grace, where's Stella?"

"Possibly at the police station."

"Police station?"

"You haven't seen the news today?"

He hadn't.

After last night's disastrous confrontation at Houston Grand Hotel, he'd drowned in regret all day.

Maybe he shouldn't have exposed her so bluntly.

Today he'd buried himself in work until the thunder woke him.

"Her uncle caused a scene at the company today," Grace said hoarsely. "He jumped."

"Actually jumped?"

"Yes." Grace's voice broke. "Stella was taken to the station. We haven't heard from her since. Adrian, with the children here, I can't—you're the only one in Houston I trust to—"

"I'm on my way." Adrian gunned the engine. "Don't worry. At least at the station she's safe."

"She's terrified of thunderstorms. These past years, every time it thundered she'd—"

"I know. She's been afraid since childhood."

"This is different." Grace's voice shook. "Before, having someone nearby helped. Now she shakes uncontrollably, sobbing under the blankets..."
###Chapter 252: What Are You Doing?

Rain poured in torrents as Adrian Roland's car tires splashed through flooded streets.

Harsh fluorescent lights glared in the police station lobby.

"Her husband already picked her up," the desk officer said without looking up.

Adrian's knuckles rapped sharply against the counter. "Husband?"

"Yeah. The young couple left on a motorcycle."

Motorcycle.

Victor Valence.

Adrian turned so abruptly he knocked over a chair.

Joy Fairsprene's sleepy voice answered his call. "Who the hell calls at this hour—"

"Where's Julian?"

Fabric rustled before Julian Valois' groggy voice came through. "Adrian?"

"Where did Victor take Stella?"

"That kid's always disappearing—wait, Mount Rainier! He mentioned watching the sunrise there last week."

Tires screeched on wet pavement.

Mount Rainier. The name stabbed like a needle into Adrian's temple. He wrenched the steering wheel as rain pounded the windows, blending with the phantom sobs from his nightmares.

...

Under a dilapidated awning, Stella Valentine trembled while clutching a paper cup.

Victor wrung water from his T-shirt, droplets tracing the defined lines of his torso.

"Should've taken my Range Rover," he muttered, shaking wet hair. "Damn weather."

Stella stared at the curtain of rain. "Why bring me here?"

"To jog your memory." Victor suddenly leaned in. "Didn't you used to—"

"Mr. Valence!" She recoiled.

He offered his damp shirt. "Put this on."

"No thanks."

"Afraid hubby will get jealous?" Victor sneered. "After what he—"

Blinding headlights sliced through the storm.

Adrian's car door slammed with enough force to send night birds fleeing from the trees.

"What the hell is this?"

He yanked Stella forward, making her stumble. Victor's shirt landed in the mud.

"Evening stroll, Mr. Roland?" Victor smirked.

Adrian shoved Stella into the passenger seat. The engine roared as tires crushed the abandoned shirt.

Blasting heat filled the car interior.

"He's your husband?" Adrian gripped the wheel.

Stella shook her head.

"Then shut up." The accelerator slammed. "You're going home before this storm clears."
###Chapter 253: I'd Trade Everything for You

"But he—"

"No buts." Adrian Roland's voice sharpened abruptly, his knuckles whitening on the steering wheel.

Stella Valentine flinched at his reaction, instinctively shrinking toward the car door.

Adrian swallowed hard, regaining composure. "I mean... He's a grown man. He can take care of himself."

Stella pressed her lips together.

Victor Valence had accompanied her all day, only to be left alone at the police station. The guilt weighed on her like a stone.

But this was Adrian's car. She had no right to dictate his decisions.

"About the police station..." Adrian softened his tone. "Victor Lefèvre is cornered. You handled it perfectly. Short-term losses for long-term stability—that's smart business."

"Mhm."

Raindrops pelted the windshield as Adrian turned on the stereo. Teresa Teng's "The Long and Winding Road" filled the car.

"Walking by your side, no matter how far, I'll never tire..."

The melody smoothed their frayed nerves like gentle hands.

"Cold?" Without waiting for an answer, Adrian shrugged off his cardigan and offered it to her.

Beneath it, he wore only a cotton loungewear shirt. The gray-brown knit still carried his body heat. Stella caught a whiff of cedarwood—a scent that transported her to years past when he'd drape jackets over her shoulders.

"Watch the road!" She jerked upright.

Adrian chuckled. "Don't trust my driving?"

"It's slippery!" Her voice trembled. "What if—"

"What if what?" His gaze burned into her.

Stella turned away. "...Just be careful."

"Then put this on first." He stubbornly held out the cardigan. "Luna cried herself hoarse on the phone, saying bad men took Mommy away."

"Luna cried?" Stella sat bolt upright. "She never cries—"

A warm hand covered her icy fingers. "We're going home now. But you need to take care of yourself. The company, the kids, your mother—they all depend on you."

"And you?" She looked up. "Your burdens are heavier than mine."

"Me?" Adrian's mouth twisted. "After Grandfather passes and you all move abroad, I'll truly be alone."

He shoved the cardigan into her arms and gripped the wheel again.

Stella clutched the warm fabric. "...Penny says you've been pulling all-nighters."

"Concerned about me?"

"I want you to be well." Her nails dug into her palms. "But we ended three years ago."

"I know." His eyes stayed fixed ahead.

"I'll cooperate with Grandpa Edward to ease his mind."

"Right."

"You and Wendy Evans—"

"Never happened." He scoffed. "She got her compensation. We're square."

Stella twisted the hem of her shirt. "You're too alike—both unwilling to compromise. You'll meet someone right for you. I'll keep an eye out."

Adrian suddenly turned. "Why do you sound like my mother?"

Her ears burned. "...I just want you to be happy."

"Why?" He pinned her with his gaze. "Because I'm your ex-husband? The children's father? Or to relieve yourself of this charade?"

"I promised to look after Grandpa Edward!"

"And if I remarry?"

"I'll always be his granddaughter-in-law!" The words tumbled out.

Adrian's eyes darkened. "That almost sounds like... hope."

The rain-slicked streets were empty. Soon, the black Maybach pulled up to Houston Grand Hotel.

Stella seized the escape. "We're here! The kids must be waiting."

She fled into the elevator, missing the desolation in the man's eyes behind her.

A phone rang sharply.

"Well, well, Mr. Roland." Victor Valence's mocking voice crackled through. "Quite the smooth kidnapper."

Adrian rolled down the window, letting cold rain hit his face. "Stay away from her."

"Why should I?" Victor laughed. "We both know who holds her heart. At least I never hurt her."

"Would your family accept a divorced woman?"

"I'd walk away with nothing." Victor sounded careless. "And you? With billions in assets and global branches—would you give it all up?"

Through the downpour, Adrian's voice cut like steel:

"If I could turn back time, I'd trade everything to win her heart again."

Even if it meant losing every penny.

Even if it destroyed him.
###Chapter 254: When Memory and Reality Overlap

The door beeped and swung open.

Silence filled the room.

By the dim hallway light, Stella saw Ethan curled up on the couch with his little sister Luna, both fast asleep. Grace stirred at the sound and opened her eyes—

"Shh." Stella pressed a finger to her lips.

Mother and daughter tiptoed into the guest room.

"Why did the police keep you so late?" Grace whispered. "It wasn't your fault. That man's suicide had nothing to do with you. They didn't even let you make a phone call..."

"Mom, I was released this afternoon." Stella adjusted her soaked collar. "My phone died."

Grace finally noticed her daughter's drenched state and hurried to fetch a towel and hot water. "How did you get this wet?"

"The rain was heavy."

Warmth slid down her throat, easing the chill.

Grace began drying her hair, then froze. "Is this... Adrian's jacket?"

Stella startled, realizing she still wore his coat.

"Where is he?"

"He left after dropping me at the hotel."

Ding-dong—

The doorbell rang sharply.

"Mommy's home!" Luna's sweet voice carried from the living room.

Little footsteps pattered excitedly.

"Dad!" Ethan's thrilled shout pierced through the door.

Luna's voice quivered. "Where's Mommy? Didn't Daddy go save her?"

Adrian's deep voice soothed. "Mommy's already back."

"Liar!" Luna sniffled. "Mommy's not here..."

Stella couldn't stay seated. She pushed the door open. "Mommy's right here."

Luna launched into her arms like a cannonball, nuzzling her face against Stella's neck. "Daddy really rescued Mommy!"

Ethan, however, stared at his parents' soaked clothes, eyes gleaming. "Did a water monster take Mommy? Like the Loch Ness Monster?"

Adrian's lips curved slightly. "Yes. A very fast one."

"But Daddy's stronger!" Luna gazed up at her father adoringly. "Big Brother was right—Daddy's handsome AND brave!"

Ethan puffed his chest proudly. "See? I didn't lie!"

Adrian's heart melted as he watched their chattering children.

Three years had passed. Ethan's features mirrored his own more each day, while Luna's starry eyes were identical to Stella's childhood photos.

"Dad, carry me!" Luna stretched her arms wide.

Ethan clung to him too. "Tell us how you saved Mommy!"

The children koala-hugged him, making movement impossible.

Adrian lifted his gaze to Stella.

"...Go take a hot bath," she murmured.

The kids cheered, dragging both parents toward the bathroom.

"Mommy needs one too!" Ethan shoved them inside unceremoniously and slammed the door.

Grace's discreet cough sounded outside. "Clean clothes are in the living room..."

Steam fogged the bathroom, darkness enveloping them.

"The tub's ready." His voice was velvet in the mist.

For a dizzying moment, she was back in that rainy night three years ago. Same darkness. Same steam. Same little boy pushing them into a bathroom together.

Only now it was a hotel instead of Rose Garden.

His breath warmed the shadows between them.

Tears fell silently.

"You take the bath," he said.

"And you?"

"I'll shower."

Her fingers brushed his left arm of their own accord. "Does it still hurt?"

"A little..." He paused. "How did you know?"
###Chapter 255 Someone Who Once Walked Into Her World

Stella Valentine snapped back to reality, her fingertips trembling slightly. "I was just talking nonsense."

"Did Mr. Alistair also injure his arm?" Adrian Roland's gaze was piercing. "Left or right?"

"...Left arm."

"What a coincidence," he chuckled softly. "Same as mine. How did it happen?"

Stella shook her head. "He never told me."

"...I see."

"What about you?" she countered. "How did you get hurt?"

"Car accident." Adrian's tone was flat. "After you left the country. It was bad, but I've mostly recovered now."

Stella gave a slight nod.

It sounded less severe than Mr. Alistair's injury.

She'd once glimpsed Mr. Alistair's arm by accident—the entire limb twisted and deformed, as if deliberately mutilated rather than damaged in an accident.

The cruelest part was that she'd never learned the truth.

That secret would forever be buried with his departure.

"He didn't tell you," Adrian's voice suddenly softened, "because he didn't want you to worry."

Stella's lips twitched. "I didn't expect you to defend him."

"You thought I'd hate him?"

"..."

"I was jealous, yes. But I don't hate him." Adrian's eyes darkened. "He saved you when you were at your lowest. If not for him—"

Stella cut him off. "That's between him and me. It has nothing to do with you."

Drawing clear boundaries was her last line of defense.

Whether with Victor Valence or Adrian Roland, she treated them the same.

She had a husband—Adrian Roland II.

That was the name she'd chosen herself.

Adrian sensed her distance and tactfully stepped back. "You shower first. I'll wait outside."

The bathroom door clicked shut.

The water temperature was perfect.

Her body temperature ran low, so she preferred cooler showers—a habit he still remembered.

She finished quickly, wrapping herself tightly in a towel before stepping out.

The living room was eerily silent.

Adrian was curled on the sofa, his tall frame making the furniture seem comically small. His brows were furrowed, arms crossed over his chest like a child seeking security.

As if sensing her gaze, his eyes flew open.

"Little Star?" His voice was rough with sleep.

"Done. Your turn."

"Okay." Rubbing his temples, he stood—then suddenly frowned. "What's that scent?"

"I didn't use any fragrance."

"But the air smells... comforting."

"You're exhausted." She turned away. "Shower and get some rest."

It was nearly a retreat.

During daylight hours, she could maintain clarity. But nights always blurred her resolve.

The resemblance was uncanny.

If not for the difference in their voices...

She clung desperately to the memory of Mr. Alistair's voice. The years ahead were long, and she feared even this last remnant would fade with time.

"Mommy?" Ethan peeked out, rubbing his eyes. "Did Daddy leave again?"

"He's showering."

The boy visibly relaxed. "I thought he went to fight bad guys again. Mommy, can Daddy sleep with me tonight?"

"He has work tomorrow—"

"Just one night!" Ethan's pleading eyes locked onto hers. "I'll be extra good after this."

The words pierced her heart.

She'd failed Ethan in so many ways.

Apart from those brief months with Mr. Alistair, her son had never known a father's love.

"Ethan," she knelt to his level, "remember the daddy who bought you Iron Man?"

Ethan pointed confusedly toward the bathroom. "Isn't that him?"

"They're two different people."

The child tilted his head. "I can't tell them apart."

Stella's chest ached.

Ethan had been only five when they left, with barely any time with Mr. Alistair. Given Adrian's striking resemblance, the confusion was inevitable.

Traces of Mr. Alistair were disappearing bit by bit.

Would she eventually be the only one who remembered him?

Once, there was a man who loved her with his entire being—then stayed forever on the other side of the stars.

Who else remembered Mr. Alistair?

Her. Uncle Xavier. Charlie Macmillan.

But now, even those witnesses to their past were gone.

"Mommy's crying?"

"No." She hastily wiped her face.

As Ethan reached out, strong arms suddenly lifted him high.

"Daddy!" The boy gasped in delight, immediately lowering his voice.

Adrian pressed a finger to his lips. "Don't wake your sister."

Ethan covered his mouth, whispering, "Mommy looks sad."

"Mommy is very brave." Adrian's gaze met hers.

The child blinked. "Daddy, can you sleep with me tonight?"

"Having nightmares?"

"I'm a big boy!" Ethan puffed his chest, then remembered to whisper, "I just want... to know what it's like waking up with Daddy there."
###Chapter 256: Iron Man vs Sun Wukong

"You'll have to ask your mom about that."

Two pairs of identical eyes turned to her simultaneously. Stella Valentine froze under their gaze.

Suite 0826 had three bedrooms. Grace Laurent took Luna to one room, while father and son shared another, leaving the guest room for her.

"...Don't stay up too late. I'm going to the guest room."

The moment she turned, a hand caught her wrist.

Stella frowned. "What is it?"

Adrian Roland cradled their son with one arm, his injured limb hanging uselessly. The damp weather made his old wound throb, rendering his grip featherlight.

"Stay with Ethan tonight." His voice was soft. "Consider it making up for lost time."

Her gaze flickered.

"I won't do anything with him here." He paused. "Besides...the compatibility test results..."

Her head jerked up, but Ethan's hopeful expression melted her resolve. She couldn't miss that medical update.

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted as he guided them into the bedroom—Ethan in one arm, her hand in the other.

The room was cramped. Aside from a bed and nightstand, it held nothing. Suite 0826 was a standard business accommodation, a far cry from the luxury of Room 1231, with a bathroom half the size.

"Sorry about the space." Stella flushed. "The bed might be tight."

"Smaller feels cozier." Adrian deftly removed Ethan's shoes and tucked him in with practiced motions.

"You...take care of children often?"

"Only my son." A quiet chuckle. "Fatherhood comes with instincts."

She fell silent.

Once Ethan was settled, Adrian turned to her. Stella bolted under the covers like a startled rabbit, making their son blink. "Does Mommy know kung fu?"

"Mommy's just...cold." Her ears burned.

Ethan immediately hugged her arm. "Daddy, come warm Mommy up!"

"No need!" She recoiled. "The blankets are plenty warm."

Adrian said nothing, simply lying down on Ethan's other side.

Twenty years of intimacy made thoughts transparent between them. He recognized her tension; she understood his restraint. This unspoken familiarity prickled down her spine.

"What story would you like?" Adrian changed the subject.

Ethan's eyes lit up. "Iron Man vs Sun Wukong! Daddy, who would win?"

"Sun Wukong, obviously." Adrian deadpanned. "Iron Man would still be flying while the Monkey King somersaults to the heavens."

Stella facepalmed internally.

"What about Iron Man vs Ultraman?"

"Iron Man. Ultraman's monsters are idiots."

"Iron Man vs Poseidon?"

Adrian raised a brow. "You know Poseidon?"

"God of the sea!" Ethan crowed. "Iron Man would rust underwater!"

They dissolved into laughter until Ethan's expression dimmed. "Kids at school call me a liar...say I don't have a dad..."

Adrian tightened his embrace. "Invite them to Houston. Daddy will host."

"Really?"

"Daddy never lies."

Amid the giggles, Stella grew drowsy. Half-asleep, she heard a phone vibrate. Adrian stepped onto the balcony.

"Uncle Xavier?"

"You're not at the office tonight?" The old man's voice was razor-sharp.

"At the hotel."

"With Miss Evans?"

"We broke up ages ago." A lighter clicked. "I have standards."

Mr. Xavier gave a satisfied hum. "Women are distractions. The Evans family was just a stepping stone—Africa's gem market is the real prize."

"I know."

"And that Stella is poison!" The sudden venom made Adrian's jaw tighten. "Adrian, you're my handpicked successor. You mustn't—"

Exhaling smoke, Adrian glanced at the sleeping figures inside. He stubbed out the cigarette.
###Chapter 257: Hush, Don't Cry

Adrian Roland's breath hitched.

Mr. Xavier Atlante noticed the subtle shift immediately. "Mentioning Stella Valentine still unsettles you," he observed with a dry chuckle.

"Uncle Xavier, I'll handle all the business matters you've assigned."

"I trust you will." The older man's tone shifted. "But there are certain things you need to understand."

Adrian tightened his grip on the phone. "Beyond professional obligations, I'd prefer to make my own decisions."

"Meaning?"

"The company will remain my priority, but when it comes to personal matters—"

"This is about Stella again?" Mr. Atlante's voice turned glacial. "The moment she returned, your engagement with the Evans family collapsed."

"That had nothing to do with her."

"Then what do you want?"

Adrian tilted his head toward the night sky. "To take care of her and the children."

"Absolutely not!"

"Why?"

"She'll destroy everything you've built!" Mr. Atlante snapped. "Your career has flourished these past years. Would you throw it all away for a woman?"

A humorless laugh escaped Adrian. "She doesn't wield that kind of power."

"What if she demanded you abandon everything?"

The question struck like a dagger to the heart.

Victor Valence had posed the same inquiry.

The answer had been etched into his bones long ago.

Outwardly successful, he'd been a hollow shell for years. During bipolar episodes, only medication kept him functional. Countless sleepless nights ended with visions of Stella's tear-streaked face.

"Uncle Xavier, I just want to breathe easier."

"Your achievements bring you no joy?"

"Are you truly happy?"

Silence stretched between them. "Love is an illusion. Stella has moved on with someone else."

"But when she's near, I can sleep."

"Get better sleeping pills!"

"I've tried them all." Adrian's voice turned weary. "My psychiatrist says the bipolar disorder—"

"Quack medicine!" Mr. Atlante cut in sharply. "Focus on securing the African project first. As for that sham marriage of yours—"

The screen went black.

Dead battery.

Adrian exhaled as if shedding an immense weight. Stubbing out his cigarette, he waited until the smoke dissipated before returning inside.

In the master bedroom, Stella lay curled around Ethan, both deep in sleep. Her unconscious movement pulled the child closer, exposing the delicate curve of her neck.

Barefoot, he approached. The icy floor tiles sharpened his awareness.

As he settled beside them, the scent of jasmine enveloped him. The familiar fragrance gradually loosened the tension in his muscles.

Half-asleep, he felt gentle fingers tracing his jawline.

That touch—warm and achingly familiar.

Instinctively, he caught the wandering hand and pressed a kiss to its palm.

A tearful whisper reached him through the darkness. "...missed you..."

Adrian smiled in the shadows.

His little star still cried so easily.

"Hush," he murmured drowsily. "Tomorrow... we'll get married... I'll pluck the stars for you..."
###Chapter 258: I Would Never Use Children as Bargaining Chips

Morning light filtered through the gap in the curtains.

Adrian Roland opened his eyes, disoriented for a few seconds by the unfamiliar ceiling. Then a small head popped out from under the covers.

"Daddy..." Ethan rubbed his eyes, his little face scrunched up. "My tummy hurts..."

Only then did Adrian remember spending the night at Stella Valentine's place. Seeing his son's flushed face, he sighed and threw back the blanket.

"Go to the bathroom. Now."

As Ethan dashed out clutching his stomach, the aroma of breakfast already filled the air.

Stella was busy in the kitchen. The gray suit she wore today accentuated her slender waist perfectly. She froze when she noticed him.

"Toiletries are in the bathroom," she said without meeting his eyes, arranging bowls and chopsticks. "Grace took Luna for morning exercises."

Adrian nodded, but his gaze lingered on her. Three years had passed, yet that stubborn pride still clung to her.

"Mommy!" Luna's bright voice rang from the doorway. The little girl threw herself into Stella's arms, her eyes red. "I had a bad dream last night..."

Stella's heart ached as she lifted her daughter. Adrian noticed her arms trembling slightly—Luna wasn't so small anymore.

"Let me." He took the child effortlessly. Luna immediately wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing her cheek against his shoulder.

Stella hesitated. Adrian cut straight to the point. "I'll take them today."

"You're not working?"

"Taking Ethan to the office." He bounced Luna in his arms. "And I'll keep our daughter with me."

Ethan burst out of the bathroom, bouncing excitedly. "Daddy, are we going to fight monsters?"

Breakfast ended in cheerful chaos. Stella stood by the entrance putting on her shoes, her brow furrowed.

"Luna needs a snack at ten. Add honey to her milk." The words tumbled out rapidly. "Afternoon fruit portions shouldn't exceed—"

"I remember." Adrian interrupted. "I'll bring them back exactly as they are tonight."

Stella searched his eyes. "Promise?"

"If Adrian Roland wants something, he doesn't need to use children as bargaining chips."

The Maybach stopped in front of Shi's Jewelry headquarters. Stella lingered in the passenger seat. From the backseat came Luna's sweet reminder: "Mommy, be careful of bad people!"

"Daddy will protect Mommy!" Ethan declared solemnly.

Seeing his wife's worried expression in the rearview mirror, Adrian suddenly leaned over and unbuckled her seatbelt.

"Be back by six," he murmured near her ear. "Or I'll come get you with the kids."

Stella's eyes widened, but he'd already returned to the driver's seat, a faint smile playing on his lips.

In the New Frontier Group lobby, employees gaped as their workaholic CEO walked in—carrying an angelic little girl in one arm and holding the hand of a boy who looked just like him.

"Mr. Roland, is this...?"

"My son and daughter." He squeezed Luna's small hand. "Say hello."

Luna buried her face shyly against his shoulder while Ethan puffed out his chest. "Hello, sir! I'm here to help Daddy fight monsters!"

Before the elevator doors closed, Adrian turned to his stunned assistant. "Buy some kid-friendly meals and toys."

The assistant stammered, "Sir, the board meeting this afternoon—"

"Postpone it." He nuzzled the top of his daughter's head. "Today, my little girl comes first."
###Chapter 259: Father's Blood and Tears

"Since when does Mr. Roland have kids? Didn't he just break up?"

"Shh, keep your voice down. I heard he used to date a woman named Lily..."

"Lily?"

"Yes, Lily."

Ethan suddenly let go of his father's hand and ran back to the whispering employees. He looked up at them with a serious expression. "My mom's name is Stella! S-T-E-L-L-A!"

The employees froze in awkward silence.

Luna rested her chin on her father's shoulder, blinking her big eyes. "Daddy..."

"Hmm?"

"Did you have other girlfriends before?"

Adrian's steps faltered.

He looked down into his daughter's innocent eyes and whispered, "...Yes."

"Then did you not love Mommy?"

"I did."

"If you loved Mommy, why were you with someone else?" Luna pouted. "That's not right."

Adrian's throat tightened. "Daddy knows he was wrong. Can you forgive me?"

Luna shook her head.

"You won't forgive Daddy?"

"Mommy says people should apologize when they do wrong things, but we don’t have to forgive them." She counted on her fingers. "Like when a mean kid at Ethan's school called us bastards. Ethan hit him, and the kid apologized, but Ethan didn’t forgive him."

Adrian's pupils constricted sharply.

"What does 'bastard' mean?" Luna asked innocently.

Adrian's chest tightened painfully.

"But Ethan and I have a daddy!" Luna declared proudly. "Mommy said you were protecting Earth, so you couldn’t be with us much..."

Adrian's eyes burned.

He couldn’t fathom how Stella had endured all these years alone.

Ethan stormed back, his eyes red-rimmed with unshed tears.

Adrian crouched down and gently wiped his son's face. "Come on, let's go to Daddy's office."

Outside the CEO's office, Penny and Jason stood waiting.

"Oh my god!" Penny gasped. "That’s definitely Mr. Roland’s son! They look identical!"

Adrian frowned. "Find some children's books."

"Now?" Penny's eyes widened. "But everyone’s waiting in the conference room for the meeting—"

"Cancel it."

Penny inhaled sharply.

Workaholic Mr. Roland was canceling a meeting... for his kids?

Inside the office, both children sat glumly.

Adrian pulled up an episode of Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf on his computer.

"Daddy," Ethan scrunched his nose in disdain. "We stopped watching this ages ago."

"What do you watch now?"

"Iron Man!" Ethan's eyes lit up. "You even bought me an Iron Man action figure before!"

Adrian immediately called his secretary. "Penny, buy Iron Man toys."

"Um..." Penny hesitated. "The budget—"

"Send me your account details."

Two minutes later, Penny gaped at the $50,000 transfer notification.

Emails kept flooding in as Adrian worked.

He glanced up to see Ethan entertaining Luna.

"You can keep working, Daddy," Ethan said understandingly. "When Mommy was busy, Luna and I played by ourselves."

Adrian's heart clenched. "Was Mommy... working very hard?"

"Yeah." Ethan nodded. "She said we didn’t have startup funds, so she couldn’t buy good gemstones. She had to stay up late designing..."

"No funds?" Adrian was stunned. "But abroad, you—"

"At first, we couldn’t even afford rent." Ethan lowered his head. "Later, money appeared in Mommy’s account, but she said it was earned with Daddy’s life. She refused to spend a single cent..."

Adrian's pen clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 260: Mr. Alistair... He's Actually Still Alive, Isn't He?

Adrian Roland stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows in his top-floor office at New Frontier Group, cigarette ash crumbling between his fingers.

Meanwhile, at Shi's Jewelry, Stella Valentine faced an unprecedented crisis.

"All supply channels are cut off?" Her nails dug into her palms. "We can't even source basic melee diamonds?"

The procurement manager wiped his brow. "New Frontier has monopolized all output from African mines. They control every diamond on the market now. Either we pay their 300% markup..."

"Or?"

"Or we abandon our mounted jewelry line."

Stella slammed the folder shut, its metal clasp snapping sharply. Sunlight through the blinds cast jagged shadows across her ashen face.

"Ms. Valentine, perhaps... we could negotiate with Mr. Roland?"

Negotiate? That man was forcing her to surrender. Pressing fingers to her throbbing temple, Stella suddenly longed for Mr. Alistair's perceptive gaze that always saw through her struggles.

"Who else in Houston has inventory?"

The manager hesitated. "William Rubenstein from Zenith Industries... He stockpiled melee diamonds for watch dials last year."

The glass slipped from Stella's grip, staining the wool carpet. Memories of Mount Rainier coiled around her throat like vipers—she could almost smell that nauseating eau de cologne.

"Ms. Valentine? You look unwell—"

"I'm fine." Her voice sounded foreign. "Any other options?"

"None. Also..." He handed her a report. "After Victor Lefèvre's suicide, our return rate spiked 70%. Cash flow is..."

"Understood."

Alone in the silent office, Stella stared at the scribbled phone number, acid churning in her stomach. This time, no Mr. Alistair would descend like a savior when she entered that den of wolves.

The phone rang.

"Miss Valentine." The aged voice grated like a blunt knife on glass. "You broke our agreement."

Ice shot down her spine. "Mr. Xavier."

"I told you to leave Houston forever. Yet you returned with that child." A teacup clinked. "Clearly, her life means nothing to you."

Her nails drew blood from her palms. "You promised to save Mr. Alistair."

"Am I a physician?" Mr. Xavier's voice sharpened. "He knew the consequences when he betrayed the organization for you!"

"Then tell me," she trembled, "where is his grave?"

"His ashes were scattered on Mount Rainier."

"Show me the cremation certificate."

Dead silence. Stella's pulse roared in her ears. "You can't produce it, can you?"

"What are you implying?"

"Mr. Alistair isn't dead." Each word fell like a hammer. "You're hiding him."

Mr. Xavier's laughter oozed grotesque delight. "Stella Valentine, you truly—"

"I want proof." She cut him off. "Or I'll tear this city apart to find him."

"That little girl, Celeste," he drawled. "What if her condition suddenly deteriorated...?"

Her blood turned to ice.

"Choose." Victory dripped from his tone. "The truth, or your daughter's life?"
###Chapter 261: Cherish the Present

"I'm not leaving."

"Besides the matter with the child, I'll also help you handle your father's company."

Stella Valentine chuckled softly. "Mr. Atlante, the more you rush to send me away, the more certain I am that Mr. Alistair is still alive."

"Are you trying to trick me into revealing something?"

"Takes one to know one."

Mr. Xavier Atlante's voice dropped abruptly. "Miss Valentine, making an enemy of me isn't wise."

"I never intended to be your enemy," Stella replied calmly. "You want an heir who's completely focused, so you tore us apart—even lied about his death. When I heard the news in Europe, I suspected it immediately. Did you hide him away? I'd rather believe that."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"I love him. I want him to be happy. If choosing me comes at too high a cost, I'll walk away on my own." Stella paused. "Mr. Atlante, a woman isn't necessarily an obstacle to success. As long as he's alive and well, it doesn't matter if I'm in his life or not."

"More mind games?"

"This time, it's the truth." Her voice trembled slightly. "I just want to know if he's safe. Answer that one question, and I'll give up immediately."

"..."

"You used Celeste's life to threaten me. I can't fight back. With your resources, hiding someone is child's play."

Stella took a deep breath. "To be honest, I came back for two reasons: to find a liver donor for Celeste and to save the company. If Mr. Alistair is in Houston, his skills would eventually lead me to him—unless you never let him surface again."

"Miss Valentine," Mr. Atlante's voice turned icy, "your words are truly repulsive."

"Negotiations require showing your hand. That's what he taught me."

"What else did he teach you?"

"He also said to demand repayment for every injustice suffered."

The sound of walnuts rolling echoed through the line as Mr. Atlante seemed to weigh his options.

"Uncle Xavier." Grant Rubenstein's voice suddenly cut in. "The Lu'an Melon Seed Tea just arrived."

"Get out."

Footsteps faded, followed by the click of a door closing.

"Miss Valentine."

"I'm listening."

"My greatest regret is not bringing him back sooner." Mr. Atlante sighed. "One of him was headache enough. Now there's you."

Stella laughed softly. "The fact that you can spar with me for this long proves you're in excellent health. You'll live a long life."

"Is that a blessing?"

"Of course."

"Aren't you hoping I'd die sooner so you can reunite with him?"

Stella was silent for a moment. "If he's alive but hasn't come looking for me, there are only two possibilities: either he's still recovering from severe injuries—which wouldn't stop me from returning—or... he simply doesn't want to see me."

Mr. Atlante burst into laughter. "Miss Valentine, you should've been a detective."

"Everyone has their own fate." Her voice remained steady. "If he truly doesn't wish to see me, what are you afraid of? Why not just tell me?"

"You're right." His tone suddenly lightened. "Fine. Yes, he's alive."

Stella's breath caught.

"Not just alive—he's thriving."

"Then he—"

"That's enough." Mr. Atlante cut her off. "Don't push your luck."

A realization struck Stella. "Was it because of that letter? Did he see what I wrote and then—"

"I said I won't say more." His voice turned cold again. "My connections far exceed your imagination. Deal with Shi's Jewelry first. I'll contact you when there's news about the liver donor. Don't test my limits."

The call ended abruptly.

Stella clutched her phone, a sharp pain piercing her chest.

"Ms. Valentine?" An assistant's voice came from outside the door. "A Ms. Fairsprene is here to see you."

"Let her in."

Before the words fully left her mouth, Joy Fairsprene had already pushed the door open. "I told them I'm your best friend! Stella!"

Stella forced a smile and stepped forward to greet her.

"Got any food? I'm starving!" Joy rubbed her stomach dramatically.

Stella gestured for the assistant to prepare something, then pulled a milk candy from her pocket.

"You keep candy in your suit jacket?" Joy's eyes widened.

"Open."

Joy obediently accepted the candy, mumbling around it, "You're the best."

"Fighting with Julian again?"

"He wants me dressed like a snowman!" She pouted. "It's December, so what? The sun's blazing..."

"Joy," Stella interrupted softly, "cherish the present."

Joy's voice quieted. "I know..."

"Right now, I'd give anything just to hear Mr. Alistair nag at me again..."

"Oh!" Joy suddenly clapped her hands. "That's why I'm here! Our station just launched a new dating show—all the male contestants are tall, rich, and handsome. Wanna give it a shot?"
###Chapter 262: It's Mr. Alistair Who's Good to You, Not Him!

Stella instinctively shook her head.
"I'm swamped with work and taking care of the kids. Celeste needs me too..."

"Don't say no yet!" Joy tugged her arm excitedly.
"These bachelors are all elites. Maybe they can help Celeste?"

Stella frowned.
"That would be using them."

"It's called resource integration!" Joy whispered conspiratorially, pulling out her phone.
"Look at Dr. Melford. Specializes in liver diseases. I did my research."

The man in the photo appeared mid-thirties, wearing a simple white tee and jeans. His warm smile radiated quiet confidence without any flashy luxury items.

What made Stella's breath catch—
Those smiling eyes resembled someone from her memories.

"Looks like Adrian, doesn't he?" Joy leaned in.
"Mr. Alistair is his twin, and this doctor has similar features too."

Stella's fingers trembled slightly. The gentle gaze did mirror Mr. Alistair's.

"He's from Houston?"

"Grew up in an orphanage. No family." Joy suddenly turned serious.
"Stella, I owe you so much."

"Don't be ridiculous."

"If Mr. Alistair hadn't invested, my family's company would've gone bankrupt." Joy's eyes reddened.
"And Celeste..."

At Harry's mention, both women fell silent.

"Just trust me this once?" Joy grasped her hand.
"Consider it another option for Celeste."

Stella sighed. She couldn't fully rely on Mr. Xavier's treatment...

"One episode only."

"Deal!" Joy cheered.
"I'll pick you up Saturday!"

A knock interrupted them. An intern entered with coffee.
"Ms. Valentine, about the company..."

Stella noticed his badge.
"From the design department?"

"I'm the only one left." He smiled wryly.
"Everyone else quit. I'm here to learn from you."

Joy nibbled a cookie teasingly.
"Another admirer! Victor fell for your designs too."

Casually, Stella asked,
"Did he get caught in the rain last night?"

Joy's eyes sparkled.
"You were together?"

"Not what you think..."

"Wouldn't it be perfect to be sisters-in-law?"

Stella massaged her temples.
"Adrian drove me home."

"That bastard?!" Joy exploded.
"Stella, wake up! Mr. Alistair treats you right, not that scumbag! Twins or not, they're completely different!"
Twilight deepened as city lights flickered to life.

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the glittering skyline. My exhausted reflection stared back from the glass, dark circles shadowing my eyes.

My phone vibrated on the desk.

"Ms. Lin, the documents you requested have been sent to your email," my assistant's voice came through the receiver.

I massaged my temples. "Thank you."

After hanging up, I opened the email. Rows of alarming red warnings marked the spreadsheets and charts.

The company's cash flow was collapsing faster than anticipated.

My fingers tapped the desk absently as I stared at the screen. Neon lights outside cast shifting shadows across my face.

The office door swung open without warning.

"Working late again?"

That familiar voice made my head snap up. Lucian stood in the doorway, his suit jacket draped over one arm, tie slightly loosened.

"What are you doing here?" I instinctively closed my laptop.

He stepped closer, the faint scent of ambergris lingering around him. "Heard you've been busy lately."

I forced a smile. "Just some company matters."

His dark eyes studied my face. "Need help?"

"No." I shook my head. "I can handle it."

After a pause, he suddenly reached out, brushing his fingertips beneath my eye. "You've lost weight."

The warmth of his touch sent a tremor through me.

"I'm taking you home." He grabbed my purse before I could protest.

We stood side by side in the elevator. Our reflections looked perfectly matched in the mirrored walls, yet an invisible barrier remained between us.

"I know about Lin Corporation's situation," he said abruptly.

My body tensed.

"I could—"

"No." I cut him off. "This is my problem."

The elevator doors slid open at the lobby.

Lucian seized my wrist. "Must you always be this stubborn?"

I wrenched free. "Mr. Lu, mind your manners."

His expression darkened in the dim light.

"Fine." He took a step back. "I'll wait for you to come to me."

I turned and walked into the night, my heels clicking against the cold pavement like knives stabbing with each step.

An engine roared behind me. A black sedan sped past, its taillights disappearing into the distance.

I stopped, fists clenched, watching it go.

My phone buzzed again.

An unknown number flashed on the screen:

"Ms. Lin, we need to talk about your father."
###Chapter 263: What Did You Just Call Me?

She knew better than anyone that they were ultimately two separate individuals.

Memories surged.

Stella Valentine recalled the awkward moment of mistaken identity, her fingers unconsciously clutching the hem of her blouse.

"I know my limits," she murmured.

Joy Fairsprene stomped her foot in frustration. "Stella, we agreed to move forward. No matter how wonderful Mr. Alistair was, he's already—"

"He's not dead," Stella abruptly interrupted.

"What?!" Joy gasped, covering her mouth. "Then where is he now?"

"I don't know." Stella shook her head, bitterness welling in her eyes. "Four years. If he's alive but hasn't come looking for me..."

"Could he have amnesia?"

Stella gazed out the window. "Maybe separation is the best ending for us."

"Nonsense!" Joy's eyes reddened with urgency. "After everything you've been through—"

"Precisely because I love him," Stella said softly. "If leaving is better for him, I'll disappear completely."

Joy blurted out, "What about the child—"

She cut herself off mid-sentence.

That was Stella's deepest wound.

Stella smiled faintly instead. "If I've decided to let go, there's no point bringing it up."

"You're going to shoulder this alone?"

"I can handle it." She straightened her back. "I've survived harder days."

......

Before leaving, Joy repeatedly reminded Stella of their Saturday appointment, her expression mysterious.

Houston had changed.

Four years had rewritten the city's landscape.

Harry Vance had risen from obscurity to become a top celebrity, climbing over Joy's back to get there.

That snowy night in the Alps, the desperate phone call remained vivid.

The fan's child, the cyberbullying, the family estrangement... until Julian Valois stepped in to mediate.

Celeste Roland's arrival felt like destiny.

The little girl innocently believed she was her mother's biological child.

A phone ringtone shattered her reverie.

"Mommy!" Luna Roland's cheerful voice chirped through the line.

"Why are you using Penny's phone?"

"Daddy's phone got stolen by Ethan!" The little girl giggled. "Daddy's really good at video games!"

Stella frowned. "He doesn't have work today?"

"Penny said Daddy's on vacation!"

New Frontier Group was no longer what it used to be.

The Roland family's innate business acumen ran strong in Adrian's veins.

"Daddy promised to tell me bedtime stories every night!"

Stella's voice turned stern. "Put him on."

A familiar baritone answered.

"You've been smoking again?"

"How did you—"

"Your voice is hoarse." Her tone was clipped. "The children shouldn't inhale secondhand smoke."

Adrian gave a wry laugh. "You always raise your thorns against me."

"I'm only thinking of the children—"

"I didn't smoke." Exhaustion laced his words. "I'm just tired from playing with them."

Stella fell silent.

She'd misjudged him.

"...Sorry."

"Don't be." He paused. "Move back in. Hotels aren't suitable for children."

"No need."

"Luna wants bedtime stories." He sighed. "The hotel room is too cramped."

Three bedrooms were indeed insufficient.

"I'll come pick you up."

"That's not—"

"Consider it picking up the children's mother." His voice unexpectedly softened.

Stella froze.

"What did you just... call me?"
###Chapter 264: Shadows of the Past

Adrian froze.

"Stella?"

He had never called her that before.

It was always her full name Stella Valentine, or the affectionate "Little Star."

Yet the nickname slipped out so naturally that it surprised even him.

"What did you just call me?"

"My apologies."

"Why are you apologizing?"

"I've gotten used to hearing Penny call you that. It won't happen again."

Stella eyed him skeptically.

Penny had indeed always addressed her as "Stella," though she'd found it awkward and asked her to drop the honorific.

But the way Adrian said it just now made her wonder...

"Adrian, can I ask you something?"

"Go ahead."

"When you visit the cemetery... do you go alone?"

He frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Over the years, besides you and Grandpa... has anyone else visited your parents?"

"No. They preferred quiet lives. We kept the funerals simple."

"Truly... no one else?"

"Who are you asking about?" Understanding dawned. "Lily? I would never bring her there."

Stella had her answer.

He truly didn't know about Mr. Alistair's existence.

"Little Star, who exactly are you referring to?"

"Never mind. I'm going to pick up the kids now."

"I'll do it." Adrian countered. "I have news about the donor match."

Her entire body tensed.

He always knew how to control her.

The donor match dangled before her like bait, impossible to resist.

Twenty minutes later, she received his call and went downstairs.

Adrian gallantly opened the driver's door, but she walked straight to the backseat.

"Mommy!"
"Missed you!"

The two children tumbled into her arms.

"Were you good today?"

Luna pointed at her father with a conspiratorial whisper. "Daddy lied to Ethan!"

Adrian rubbed his temples. "My little traitor."

Stella's expression darkened. "Parents should lead by example."

"Then ask her what I supposedly lied about."

Luna piped up in her tiny voice: "Daddy said the game only has 300 levels!"

Adrian explained, "Ethan was getting too absorbed. I didn't want to be late picking you up."

Ethan looked devastated. "You... lied to me?"

"Which is more important—your game or Mommy?"

The boy hung his head. "Mommy..."

"Remember your priorities." Adrian turned to both children. "But lying was wrong. Daddy apologizes."

Ethan suddenly said, "Daddy seems like before now!"

"What before?"

"When we lived at Rosewood Gardens! You gave me Marshmallow there!"

Adrian's gaze shifted to Stella.

A ripple of emotion crossed her exhausted face.

"Where is Rosewood Gardens?" he asked.

"...Our old home."

"That run-down complex?"

"Yes."

"Did Mr. Alistair live there too?"

"...He did."

His eyes locked onto hers through the rearview mirror. "That tiny apartment... did you and Mr. Alistair share a bedroom?"
###Chapter 265: I'm Not That Noble

Stella Valentine lowered her lashes, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her dress.

Adrian Roland's expression darkened instantly, his jawline tightening. The temperature in the car seemed to plummet, the air turning thick with tension.

"Eyes on the road," he said coldly.

Caught off guard, Stella quickly turned to stare at the blurring scenery outside.

Houston had changed so much. The school route once lined with cotton trees was now unrecognizable. Back then, Adrian would always come for her at dawn on his black mountain bike to avoid the family driver.

With no backseat, she'd perch on the crossbar. The crisp scent of him mixed with morning breeze became the most vivid memory of her youth.

"They replaced all the cotton trees with banyans," she murmured.

"Too messy for the streets," Adrian replied tersely. "About the donor match—we have results."

Stella whipped her head around. "You found one?"

"Is that all you care about?" His laugh was bitter. "I thought you'd at least spare a second for those trees."

"This isn't the time." Her fists clenched. "What's the verdict?"

"Citywide screening—zero matches." His brows furrowed. "Even relatives rarely match, let alone strangers."

The hope drained from her as she slumped against the seat. Outside, banyan roots swayed like grasping fingers failing to catch time itself.

"Why insist on saving that boy?" he suddenly asked. "Don't pretend it's charity."

The silence stretched.

"Him again." Adrian's gaze sharpened. "Every time you go quiet, it's about Mr. Alistair."

"We shared a bedroom but nothing happened." The words tumbled out before she could stop them. She bit her lip. "Not that I owe you explanations."

Tires screeched violently.

Stella instinctively shielded Ethan and Luna. Once certain they were unharmed, she glared at Adrian. "Could you drive safely?"

"Months together and no intimacy?" He barked a laugh. "Either he's impotent or doesn't love you."

"Shut up!" Her entire body trembled. "Mr. Alistair respects my boundaries, unlike some—"

The unfinished sentence hung heavily between them.

Adrian's eyes darkened. "When did we become like this?"

"Fate's cruel joke." She turned away.

"Never forgiving me?"

"Life's too short for grudges." She watched the traffic flow outside. "You have a career, a family. Move forward."

A horn blared behind them. Adrian restarted the engine, the silence now absolute.

Only at the Houston Grand Hotel entrance did he speak. "Visit Grandpa on Saturday."

"Sunday?"

"Got plans?" His voice turned icy. "With Victor Valence?"

When she didn't answer and reached for the door, his burning hand seized her wrist. His voice was Arctic. "Remember whose woman you are."

She wrenched free and strode inside without looking back. The glass doors reflected his stormy expression and the children's bewildered eyes.
###Chapter 266: A Fateful Reunion

"It's not a date," Stella Valentine explained softly. "Joy Fairsprene works at the TV station and needs my help. Plus, with their wide audience, we might find a matching bone marrow donor."

Adrian Roland's frown eased slightly.

"Fine. I'll inform Grandfather. I'll pick you up on Sunday."

Stella didn't refuse.

This was all part of their agreed-upon act.

"How is Grandfather's health?"

"Growing weaker by the day."

"Spend more time with him."

"Hmm."

When they arrived, Stella moved to the backseat and unbuckled the children.

"Ethan, Luna, say goodbye to Daddy."

Little Luna waved obediently, but Ethan winked at Adrian. "Daddy, you promised to tell Luna a bedtime story tonight."

Luna immediately pouted. "Daddy, don't go, okay?"

Adrian's gaze shifted to Stella.

Their eyes met briefly before she quickly looked away.

"Children's education is important," Adrian said, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "Parents should lead by example."

"What are you implying?"

"As a father, I can't break my promises. I've already lied to Ethan once today."

The children tugged at her sleeves. "Mommy..."

Stella hesitated.

Refusing further would make her seem unreasonable.

But letting him into her home...

"Next time, okay?" she coaxed gently. "On Sunday, when we visit Great-Grandpa, you can stay with Daddy."

Their faces fell instantly.

Adrian had already parked and approached, scooping Luna into his arms. "Don't force it. I'll take them to a hotel."

"That's not—"

"Then you're guarding against me?"

Stella fell silent.

Adrian gave her a long look before striding into the hotel lobby.

"One suite."

The front desk clerk checked the system. "Only Room 1231 at the end of the hall is available."

"That's fine."

Stella rushed in just in time to hear the room number.

"No!" The word escaped before she could stop it.

Both the clerk and Adrian turned to her.

"Isn't that room under long-term lease?" Stella demanded.

"The guest failed to renew the payment," the clerk explained. "By policy, we can rent it out again."

"How long has it been overdue?"

"It expired last Thursday."

Exactly seven days.

Stella immediately pulled out her card. "I'll renew it."

The clerk glanced uncertainly at Adrian.

"I want that room," Adrian said coldly. "Perfect chance to see where he stayed."

"That room means a lot to me," Stella's voice trembled. "I'll pay for Room 0826 instead."

"Do I look like I need the money?"

Adrian took the keycard and headed straight for the elevator.

Only after the doors closed did the clerk exhale. "That man has an intimidating presence."

A housekeeper suddenly clapped her hands. "I remember now! He was the one who leased Room 1231 long-term!"

The clerk gasped after checking the records. "It really is the same person!"

"I knew he looked familiar," the housekeeper said knowingly. "Just a lovers' quarrel."

"How do you know they're married?"

"Look at those children," the housekeeper gestured toward the elevator. "The boy resembles him, the girl looks like her. Could they be anything but family?"

The elevator doors opened again.

Stella stepped inside and pressed the button for the 8th floor.

The clerk's eyes widened. "You were right! Room 1231 was originally leased to Mr. Roland!"

The housekeeper smiled triumphantly. "I told you. Those two are bound by fate."
###Chapter 267: As Long As We're Together

The elevator doors slid shut, cutting off the janitor's chatter.

Stella Valentine studied her reflection in the metal surface. Fine lines now framed her eyes.

Three years had erased every trace of him.

Only Mr. Xavier Atlante remained who could still speak of Mr. Alistair.

Ding—

The elevator stopped at the 12th floor.

At the end of the familiar hallway, Room 1231 waited in silence.

She'd walked this path too many times—first with trembling fear, then with hopeful anticipation, and now...

Mr. Alistair, if you're alive, why did you stop renting this room?

Did you truly... abandon me?

"What are you doing here?"

A voice in the darkness made her jump.

"Charlie?" She whirled around. "Is Mr. Alistair here? Where is he? Room 1231 or—"

"Mr. Alistair is dead." Charlie Macmillan's tone was icy.

"He's not!" She grabbed his sleeve. "You know where he is. Take me to him—"

"Let go!" Charlie shoved her away.

Her back hit the wall. Pain blurred her vision as tears spilled uncontrollably.

Charlie turned his face away. "Leave. Don't come back."

"Why?"

"You dare ask?" His jaw clenched. "He gave up everything for you, and you ran when he needed you most! What did he owe you in a past life to deserve this torment?"

"Torment?" She froze.

Charlie's expression darkened. "Just get out of Houston. The money he left will last your lifetime."

"Then why are you here?"

"Can't I mourn him?"

Stella wiped her tears. "Charlie, I know you hate me. But it was an emergency—I had to choose. Mr. Xavier slipped up. Mr. Alistair might be... alive."

Charlie's pupils contracted. "Mr. Xavier told you?"

"I tricked it out of him." She watched Charlie's reaction closely. "It's true, isn't it? Mr. Xavier hid him away."

Charlie sneered. "Trying to manipulate me again? I never should've helped you two. Mr. Xavier was right—women are stumbling blocks. And you... almost got him killed."

Again with "torment."

Stella frowned. She'd only known Mr. Alistair a few months. What "torment"?

Unless... he'd sacrificed for her before they even met.

"Charlie, please. You wouldn't be here without reason. He's... here, isn't he?"

After a pause, Charlie said, "Miss Valentine, if you have any conscience left, disappear. He's doing well without you."

"...Well?"

"Exceptionally well."

"That's good." Suddenly she smiled. "As long as he's happy. Did Mr. Xavier give him my letter? Is that why he's upset and won't contact me?"

"What letter?"

"You don't know?"

Charlie looked away. "...None of it matters. He doesn't want to see you. That's all."

"Did his arm heal? The car accident was so severe, he lost so much blood—"

"Stop fishing for information!" Charlie snapped. "I'll die before letting you near him this time!"

He stormed into the elevator.

Stella stood frozen, tears obscuring her sight.

Mr. Alistair was alive.

He truly... was alive.

Covering her mouth, she laughed through her tears.

Nothing else mattered.

"Mommy?"

Ethan Valentine peered at her from down the hall, head tilted.

"Mommy, what are you doing here? Daddy sent me to get you!"

She hastily dried her eyes and took his small hand. "Why didn't Daddy come himself?"

"He's shy!" Ethan blinked. "Mommy, can we get my Iron Man figures this weekend? Daddy bought all the limited editions!"

"Of course." She softened her voice. "What else has Daddy bought you?"

"Hmm..." Ethan concentrated. "Daddy said when we move abroad, he'll get me more Iron Man stuff..."

Her heart ached. She should've talked to him more that night.

"Ethan likes Iron Man? Daddy will buy them tomorrow."

The door to Room 1231 stood open.

Adrian Roland stood in the doorway holding Luna Roland, his gaze tender as it met hers.
###Chapter 268: I Truly Know I Was Wrong

Ethan looked up with sparkling eyes. "Daddy, you don't need to buy more toys. My room is almost full!"

Adrian Roland remained silent for a moment before stepping aside. "Come in."

His ambiguous tone left it unclear who the invitation was for.

Ethan eagerly pulled Stella Valentine forward. "Mommy, look! This room is so much bigger than ours!"

The presidential suite, Room 1231, remained unchanged.

Stella's gaze swept across the living room, lingering on the sofa arranged by the floor-to-ceiling windows—a familiar setup Mr. Alistair had personally adjusted.

"Come here."

Adrian's deep voice sent a tremor through her heart.

He sat on the sofa with Luna in his arms, his sharp gaze piercing. "What? Feeling nostalgic?"

Stella quickly averted her eyes. "Not in front of the children."

Adrian scoffed but said nothing more.

"Mommy, I'm hungry," Luna wriggled into Stella's arms. "Want eggs."

Stella held her daughter close and turned to Adrian. "What did they have for lunch?"

"Luna loves steamed eggs. Ethan needed proper nutrition, so I had a balanced meal prepared." His tone was stiff. "I'm their father. I wouldn't neglect them."

"That's not what I meant." Stella's voice softened. "You may not love me, but you've always been good to them."

"Who said I don't love you?"

The words slipped out before he could stop them. Both froze.

Stella's eyes widened. Adrian clenched his jaw, then laughed bitterly. "Fine. Let's clear the air today. Stella, I—"

"Stop!" She cut him off in panic.

Understanding, Adrian patted Ethan's shoulder. "Take your sister to play in the room. Daddy needs to talk to Mommy."

Ethan grinned mischievously. "Got it! No eavesdropping!"

"Mommy, hungry..." Luna whined pitifully.

Adrian scooped her up. "Daddy will order steamed eggs right away. And your favorite pork floss buns with strawberry cake, okay?"

At the mention of eggs, Luna beamed. "Okay!"

"Go with your brother. Food will be here soon."

The children disappeared into the bedroom, leaving the living room in silence.

Adrian sighed. "These years... you've worked hard."

"I'm their mother. It's my duty."

"I'll make it up to them."

Stella nodded. "You even know what Luna likes to eat. Benjamin told me you used to change her diapers yourself."

"But I still failed them." His gaze darkened. "Those Iron Man toys... Mr. Alistair bought them, didn't he?"

"Yes."

"Though I dislike him, I should thank him for that."

Stella lowered her lashes. "He doesn't need your thanks. He genuinely cared for them."

"Stella, let me finish." Adrian took a deep breath. "Today, I cleared my schedule for two reasons—to spend time with the kids, and to finally understand something. The old me... was a complete bastard. After my parents died, I thought you betrayed me. I nearly lost my mind. But that's no excuse for how I hurt you."

"That was so long ago..."

"I need to say this." His voice was firm. "From the day we met to our separation, I've pieced it all together. If Mr. Alistair were still here, I'd never interfere. But now... I just want a chance to make things right."

Stella shook her head. "You don't have to."

"I know you don't need it, but I..." He smiled bitterly. "I truly know I was wrong."

Her lashes fluttered.

"Stella, I truly know I was wrong."

"Don't." She turned away. "Let the past stay in the past. We can move on separately. There's no need to force anything for the kids."

"I'm not using them to trap you."

"Then drop this. Just treat them well."

His voice cracked. "You still won't forgive me?"

"If our roles were reversed, could you?"

"I... understand."

Stella stood. "I'll take them downstairs."

"Let me care for them tonight. You rest." Adrian's tone was resolute. "I'll keep searching for bone marrow matches. If you need anything, just ask."

After a pause, Stella said, "There is one thing."

"What?"

"Let me have this room."

......

At 8 a.m., a phone call startled Stella awake.

"Hello, is this Ms. Stella Valentine?" A sweet female voice asked.

She checked the caller ID—a local landline.

"Who is this?"

"I'm calling from Houston TV's Destiny Calling production team. Just confirming your attendance for tomorrow's recording?"

"Yes." She rubbed her temples.

"Great. Let me verify your details. Our records show you're a single mother of two, correct?"

"Yes."

"Your preferences for a partner include: height 6'1", age 25-35, annual income no less than... five million?"

The hesitation at "five million" was palpable.

Stella flushed. "That must be a mistake. Please remove that."

"Apologies, but your info board is already designed." The woman tactfully added, "Though we do have one gentleman who meets all criteria. But... given his status and you being a single mom, the outcome might not be ideal."
###Chapter 269: Brother-in-Law and Sister-in-Law

Stella Valentine's cheeks burned instantly.

"My apologies for the trouble."

The staff member waved dismissively. "Honestly, few guests on this show are genuinely looking for love..."

The unspoken words hung in the air.

For the TV station, ratings were king. Whether they truly helped people find lifelong partners was debatable.

On Saturday morning, Joy Fairsprene arrived with the truth: "If I hadn't signed you up, you wouldn't even be on this show."

Stella had already guessed. "So I'm playing the 'toad lusting after swan meat' role?"

A single mother with two children, demanding a man with an annual income of 50 million. The internet would tear her apart.

Joy winked. "Not entirely. Dr. Charles Melford is perfect for you. If you hit it off, the producers can't stop you. They'll milk the 'love conquers all' angle for ratings!"

Stella rubbed her temples. "Is he really that good?"

"Absolutely!" Joy lowered her voice. "He's actually a commitment-phobe..."

A commitment-phobe on a dating show?

Joy smirked. "It's all part of the act. A commitment-phobe and a gold digger abandoning their principles for love? Classic romance trope."

Stella understood. "So all the guests are actors? Just putting on a show?"

"Originally, yes." Joy grinned sheepishly. "But after researching, I found Dr. Melford is genuinely amazing. Stella, you can't live in the past forever."

The TV station was in Houston's western suburbs.

The studio buzzed with activity.

Joy suddenly pointed to a corner. "Look! That's Dr. Melford!"

Stella followed her gaze.

A man in a white T-shirt and jeans leaned against the wall, his sharp profile exuding arrogance.

There was a faint resemblance.

Especially in the backlight—his gentle eyes and slightly upturned lips—

"He's Male Guest #3. Remember to keep your light on for him!" Joy hurried off after a colleague called her.

"Miss Valentine?" A petite makeup artist recognized her. "Time for makeup."

The dressing room was packed with female guests.

Stella spotted a familiar figure.

The woman glanced at her through the mirror, frowning slightly. "Mr. Roland's relative?"

Stella sighed inwardly but nodded politely. "Miss Evans. What a coincidence."

Wendy Evans chuckled. "You're a guest too?"

"Yes."

"You and Adrian—"

"We're just relatives now."

Wendy raised an eyebrow. "Really? If you were his woman, he'd never let you join a dating show."

Stella smiled without answering. The misunderstanding saved her from explanations.

"What exactly is your relationship?"

Stella hesitated. "I suppose... his sister-in-law."

"Adrian has a brother?" Wendy looked shocked. "Cousins?"

"Something like that. They've never met."

"Ah, distant relatives." Wendy smirked meaningfully. "Brother-in-law and sister-in-law. Interesting..."

Stella didn't elaborate. It was too complicated.

"Miss Valentine, you're wearing this?" The makeup artist eyed her casual outfit. "Shouldn't you dress up for TV?"

She wasn't here to find love.

"This is comfortable."

The makeup artist sighed. "Fine. If you think this will attract true love..."

Stella applied lipstick herself—her entire makeup routine.

"Guests, prepare to enter!"

In the studio, the host warmed up the audience. Ten guests took their positions. Stella was Female Guest #1.

"Female Guest #1, Stella Valentine. Single mother of two. Requirements: 6'1", annual income 50 million..."

The audience burst into laughter.

Stella stood unfazed.

Male Guest #1 was Dr. Melford.

Dressed impeccably, his watch and prayer beads flaunted wealth. Noticing Stella's gaze, he looked back.

Disappointed, she averted her eyes. His face bore no resemblance.

"Female Guest #2, Wendy Evans. Influencer. Former girlfriend of New Frontier Group's Adrian Roland..."

"Male Guest #5, Victor Valence. 6'2", annual income over 50 million..."

Stella's head snapped up, meeting Victor's amused gaze.

Clad in a black leather jacket, a motorcycle helmet at his hip.

Why was he here?

A staff member had mentioned adding a male guest last minute because of her requirements.

So it was him.

"Let's welcome this episode's sponsor—New Frontier Jewelry CEO, Adrian Roland!"
###Chapter 270: I'll Take Care of My Own Children

Adrian Roland had planned to decline the TV station's invitation.

The African gemstone partnership was at a critical stage, but this sponsorship event was unavoidable. Maintaining a polished business image was essential, and his unmarried status had always been a vulnerability in negotiations.

Luna had been unusually clingy these past few days, and Ethan kept insisting on coming along. In the end, Adrian found himself carrying his daughter in one arm while leading his son into the studio with the other.

The entire studio fell into stunned silence.

On stage, Stella Valentine stood under the spotlight, a "No.1" badge pinned to her dress.

A dating show?

Stella's back burned under the weight of a predator's gaze.

"Mr. Roland, your seat is here," a hostess guided him respectfully.

The eight-figure sponsorship had secured him a front-row VIP seat. Yet his eyes remained fixed on the stage.

"Mommy!" Luna waved excitedly.

Stella wished the floor would swallow her whole.

"Brother, what's Mommy doing?" Luna tilted her head.

Ethan scratched his hair. "I think..."

Adrian settled his son into the seat and murmured, "This is Mommy's job."

The host announced the Q&A segment.

Victor Valence kept throwing pointed glances at Stella, but she ignored him.

"I'd like to ask Dr. Charles about pediatric liver transplants..."

The audience erupted in murmurs.

Medical questions on a dating show?

Dr. Charles adjusted his glasses. "For hereditary liver conditions, a living related donor yields the best results. Does the child have any siblings?"

"...No."

"Postoperative quality of life may be affected," the doctor said gently. "We can discuss this in detail after the show."

The host awkwardly changed topics. "Ms. Valentine, don't you have any personal questions?"

"No need."

When it was Wendy Evans' turn, she stared straight at Victor. "Mr. Valence, what's your ideal type?"

Victor smirked and pointed at Stella. "Someone like her."

"But she has children!"

"I don't care." Victor lifted his chin defiantly. "I'll raise her kids as my own."

Wendy's face darkened. "Raising another man's children?"

"None of your damn business." Victor scowled. "Her husband's been dead for three years—"

Ethan suddenly tugged Adrian's sleeve. "Daddy, why did that uncle say you're dead?"

Adrian's lips curled into a cold smile as he stood with Luna in his arms and walked toward the stage.

A staff member hurried after him. "Mr. Roland, how can we assist you?"

"Proving I'm still alive."

He locked eyes with Victor. "My children don't need your concern."

Wendy gasped. "Those are really your children, Ms. Valentine?"

"I'm their father."

Adrian returned to his seat with calm dignity, leaving the studio in stunned silence.

The host forced a smile. "Now, please keep your lights on for your preferred matches..."

Victor kept only Stella's light on, his gaze challenging.

Two pairs of sharp eyes clashed midair, sparks flying.

Under the spotlight, Stella stood frozen, her palms damp with sweat.
###Chapter 271: A Gift to Oneself

The atmosphere at the recording studio grew subtly tense.

Dr. Charles Melford's slender fingers pressed the button to keep his light on. The moment it illuminated, the audience erupted in murmurs.

Stella Valentine stood frozen, her lashes fluttering faintly. She hadn't expected this choice from the doctor she'd only met once.

A ripple of movement passed through the darkened audience. Adrian Roland's imposing figure became barely visible as he uncrossed his long legs and leaned forward, his gaze burning toward the stage.

"Miss Valentine." Dr. Melford's voice was as gentle as a spring breeze. "This is for you."

He opened his palm to reveal an exquisite Weeping Crabapple brooch. The silver petals still held the warmth of stage lights, glinting softly.

Stella's fingers instinctively brushed her empty collar before she realized it was missing. She carefully accepted the brooch, her fingertips accidentally grazing Dr. Melford's palm.

The contact sent a tremor through her.

Mr. Alistair's hands had felt like this too—knuckled and calloused. But his calluses were at the base of his fingers, while the doctor's were at the tips.

"This is..."

"A wedding gift." Stella's voice was barely audible. "I designed it myself."

Understanding flickered in Dr. Melford's eyes. "A very special Weeping Crabapple."

"The pendant variety," she explained without thinking. "They covered the trees on my wedding day."

"That sounds like a beautiful memory."

"Yes..."

Ahem!

Adrian had appeared behind them, his expression stormy. He seized Stella's wrist. "We're leaving."

Dr. Melford stepped forward. "Miss Valentine, would you like to have coffee tomorrow?"

"She's busy," Adrian cut in coldly.

"Mr. Roland," the doctor replied evenly, "divorced women have the right to pursue happiness too."

"Do you even know who she is?"

"A woman who deserves kindness."

Victor Valence materialized from nowhere, whistling. "Bravo! Never thought I'd see the day Adrian Roland gets schooled."

Adrian's glare could have sliced steel. "This doesn't concern you."

"Doesn't it?" Victor grinned, sidling up to Stella. "Who's it gonna be, Stella?"

Her gaze drifted past them, landing on two small figures nearby. Ethan clutched his sister's hand while Luna stood on tiptoes, watching anxiously.

She sighed. "The children are waiting."

Adrian seized the opening, pulling her close. "The black motorcycle? I'll have it delivered tomorrow."

"I don't need—"

"Watch your step." Dr. Melford's gentle warning sounded like it came from an old friend.

Stella froze mid-step.

That voice... It was too familiar. So much so that for a fleeting moment, she was back beneath that shower of falling crabapple blossoms.

Adrian's arm tightened around her. "You like black?"

She blinked up at him, dazed. "What?"
###Chapter 272: You've Always Been Like This

Adrian's tall frame shielded Stella from Dr. Charles' probing gaze. "I checked that motorcycle. It comes in five colors. Victor rides the black one. Do you like black?"

Finally understanding his implication, Stella shook her head. "No."

"Then why did you leave with him that day?" His voice lowered. "You couldn't take your eyes off that bike."

Stella took a deep breath and turned toward the children.

Ethan and Luna immediately rushed into her arms, their tiny voices chiming "Miss you, Mommy." Holding their warm little bodies, she felt all her gloom dissipate.

"Mommy, were you and Daddy fighting?" Ethan looked up with concern.

Adrian approached, effortlessly scooping Luna into one arm while taking Ethan's hand. "No. Daddy was just worried Mommy works too hard."

Ethan's eyes sparkled. "Daddy's jealous! Martha said when grown-ups talk like that, it means they're sour!"

"Martha?" Adrian's gaze snapped to Stella.

Stella explained, "The nanny's surname is Clementson. The kids call her Martha."

"You hired her?"

"...Mr. Alistair arranged it."

Adrian scoffed. "Even told him about Martha? You really hold nothing back with him."

Stella whispered sharply, "Not in front of the children."

Luna immediately covered her ears. "Brother, cover yours too! Grandma says we mustn't eavesdrop!"

Both children dramatically pressed hands over their ears—with conspicuous gaps between fingers. Adrian chuckled. "Like covering ears while stealing a bell."

"Daddy, what's that mean?" Luna blinked.

"It's when a thief covers his own ears thinking others won't hear the bell." He tweaked her nose. "Exactly like you right now."

Ethan jumped to her defense. "Luna really tried! Her hands are just too small!"

"Then are yours covering properly?" Adrian raised an eyebrow.

Ethan clamped his hands tightly. "Super proper!"

"Then how come you still hear me?"

The boy flushed upon realizing his mistake.

Adrian ruffled his hair. "We're visiting Great-grandpa tonight. He misses you both."

"Is Mommy coming?" Ethan asked hopefully.

Before Stella could respond, Adrian stated firmly, "Yes."

The children cheered.

Outside the TV station, Adrian expertly secured them in their car seats, double-checking each buckle. Stella watched as he effortlessly lifted eight-year-old Ethan one-handed, her son's eyes filled with admiration.

Perhaps boys truly needed a father's example.

"Daddy, why do you always use your right hand now?" Ethan curiously touched his left arm. "You used to carry me with this one."

Adrian flexed the limb slightly. "It's on vacation. Should be back to work next week."

"Arms take vacations too?"

"Just like how you don't want school during summer break." He deadpanned.

Ethan nodded sagely.

After settling the children, Adrian opened the passenger door. "Get in."

"I can—"

"Should I close it so you can try again properly?" His tone brooked no argument.

Stella reluctantly entered. As she sat, he suddenly leaned in, his breath brushing her cheek. In panic, she shoved his injured left arm.

"Damn—" Adrian winced.

"Sorry! I didn't mean—"

"Just fixing your seatbelt." He gritted out. "What did you think I'd do?"

Only then did Stella notice the tangled strap. Her ears burned.

"You've always been like this." Wincing, he readjusted the belt. "In school, you'd take my notebooks by mistake and get me scolded."

As the car started, Stella murmured, "Is your arm really okay?"

"Old injury."

"Should we see a doctor?"

"Stella!" He suddenly exploded. "If you won't accept me, stop this concern. I'd rather you stayed cold—so I can finally move on."
###Chapter 273: Pathetic or Not, As Long As It's Her

Stella's fingers froze midair.

Adrian glanced at the two children in the backseat, engrossed in their ear-covering game, oblivious to the tension up front.

The car glided toward the ancestral home.

Her phone buzzed.

[Ms. Valentine, there's a new wonton place downtown with authentic flavors. Free next week for a taste? —Dr. Melford]

"Him again?" Adrian's grip on the steering wheel tightened.

"Yes."

"Next week?"

"Yes."

"You agreed?"

Stella stared out the window. "Dr. Melford specializes in liver diseases. Celeste's condition can't wait."

"I'm working on the donor match."

"More experts mean more hope."

Adrian slammed the brakes. "She's not your biological child. Why this devotion? Harry abandoned her, but she still has a birth mother—"

"No!" Stella whirled toward him. "Celeste is mine."

"What if her mother comes back for her?"

Her fingers twisted in her lap. "She won't."

"Can't be sure," Adrian scoffed. "Once Celeste recovers, she's still Harry's blood—"

"Enough!" Stella cut him off. "Saving Celeste is all that matters now."

"You treat her... like your own daughter."

"I do."

His gaze darkened. "Does she... have ties to Mr. Alistair?"

Stella's nails dug into her palms.

The reaction spoke volumes.

Adrian restarted the engine. Celeste was Harry's daughter, abandoned by a mother who couldn't afford treatment. Mr. Alistair had no financial constraints or blood relation to the girl.

Then why...

His eyes flicked to Stella. Mr. Alistair's place in her heart eclipsed everything.

Including him.

Three years of emotional armor, shattered since their reunion. Xavier had taught him: A frozen heart is invincible.

Yet the walls he built crumbled the moment he saw her again.

Penny once asked, "Mr. Roland, any regrets?"

Regrets?

He was the one who erred, who wounded her, who pushed her away. What right did he have to regret?

"Did you ever hate her?" Penny pressed.

He'd pondered it deeply.

"Yes," he admitted. "But more often, I loved her. Had I known how much she suffered—"

"And your parents' accident—"

"That's why I'm torn," he'd said bitterly. "Half of me wants to be a filial son, the other half just wants to love her freely. If only I could split in two..."

Penny laughed at the absurdity. "That's Sun Wukong's magic."

Indeed. Mortals don't get doppelgängers.

At life's lowest points, people fantasize—

Stock crashes? Imagine never investing.
Breakups? Rewrite those last conversations.
Lost loved ones? Turn back time.

His fantasy? A clone who could love her without restraint.

"Penny, what's yours?"

"Oh," she grinned, "being a shrew who blocks my boyfriend's deployment."

"He's military?"

"Border patrol."

The car halted before the manor.

Benjamin hurried out. "Master Adrian! Ms. Valentine! The old master's been asking for you all day!"

"Grandfather's inside?"

"Discharged himself, insisted on seeing his great-grandchildren." Benjamin sighed. "The doctors say his time is short..."

Adrian looked at Stella. Her eyes glistened.

He extended his hand. "Shall we see Grandfather?"

He expected rejection.

Instead, soft fingers slipped into his palm. "Yes."

His heart stuttered.

This fleeting warmth wasn't for him. She'd take anyone's hand for Edward's sake.

Yet he savored it.

Pathetic? So be it.

As long as it was her.

His fingers tightened. "Let's go."
###Chapter 274: This Is My Wife, STAR

Laughter echoed at the entrance of the Roland family estate.

Benjamin hurried forward, lowering his voice. "Young Master, your foreign friend and his wife have arrived. They're inside chatting with the old master."

"Friend?"

"A dark-skinned gentleman. He brought many local specialties to visit the old master."

Stella frowned slightly. Adrian had never mentioned such a friend.

In the living room, Edward Roland was engaged in lively conversation with a foreign man of deep complexion. Beside him sat an elegant Asian woman in a moon-white cheongsam that accentuated her graceful figure.

Adrian intertwined his fingers with Stella's. "Alexander."

The foreign man turned with a brilliant smile. "TING!"

His clumsy Mandarin drew a chuckle from Adrian, who smoothly switched to fluent English. "Learned Chinese already?"

Alexander sighed in relief, responding in English. "Too difficult. That's why I brought an interpreter." He winked at the woman in cheongsam.

Stella noticed Alexander's lingering gaze. Adrian subtly pulled her closer behind him.

"TING, this must be your new bride?" Alexander asked abruptly. "I missed last week's wedding. My congratulations are belated."

Stella's chest tightened. Last week should have been their wedding day.

Adrian's arm tightened around her waist, his voice steady. "This is my wife, STAR."

"What a beautiful name!" Alexander gushed, using over a dozen "very"s to describe their compatibility.

Adrian's lips curved slightly. "Took me forever to win her over."

"Worth it."

"Absolutely worth it."

Benjamin discreetly led the children to the playroom. Alexander watched their retreating figures thoughtfully.

Stella whispered, "Why does your friend keep staring at me?"

"Not a friend," Adrian cleared his throat. "Africa's largest gemstone supplier. He only does business with married entrepreneurs."

Stella's pupils contracted. "You're monopolizing the raw gem market?"

"Only way to guarantee profits."

"What about antitrust laws?"

"I'm just providing channels," Adrian said dismissively. "They can purchase as needed."

"At your inflated prices?" Stella's voice turned icy. "Including my company?"

Adrian blinked. This wasn't something he'd normally say.

"For you," he softened his tone, "I can offer cost price."

"Hey!" Alexander interrupted. "What are you newlyweds whispering about? I heard Chinese cuisine is amazing. Aren't you taking me to try some?"

Edward suddenly boomed in Mandarin, "Restaurants? Nothing beats home cooking!"

Benjamin looked uneasy. "But the chef took leave today..." His gaze shifted to Stella. "Though we do have an excellent cook right here."
###Chapter 275: I Believe You Would Never Lie to Me

Was he asking her to play along with this charade?

Stella Valentine sighed inwardly. She never expected even business negotiations required acting out marital bliss. Suddenly, she thought of Lily Savigny—five years of maintaining that facade in front of Adrian Roland. She could never match that level of perseverance.

She'd rather pull all-nighters sketching designs than live behind a mask.

Adrian's gaze burned into her. "Is this alright? I don't want to trouble you."

Alexander Heilbronn immediately picked up on the oddity. "TING, is this how you normally speak to your wife?"

Stella arched a brow. "You understand Chinese?"

"I have an interpreter!" Alexander chuckled, gesturing to the Asian woman beside him. "TING, I do prefer working with married men. But don't lie to me—are you and STAR really married?"

Adrian's smile stiffened. "Of course we are."

"Then why haven't you touched each other since arriving? Not even a whisper without keeping your distance? Body language never lies."

Alexander's scrutiny was razor-sharp.

Stella countered, "Why insist on working with married men?"

"Married men are more responsible."

"That's not necessarily true. Some cheat despite being married, while others remain devoted despite being single. Marital status doesn't define character."

Alexander crossed his arms, studying her. "STAR, you're right. But I need reliable partners. Marriage is the simplest filter—at least married men are emotionally stable."

Stella nodded. "Fair point."

"Your English is excellent."

"Thank you. I lived in the U.S. for three years."

"Just returned?"

"About a week ago. My accent's still decent."

Alexander suddenly grinned. "You returned a week ago, yet TING claims you married half a month ago. Either you've been together much longer, or—he was originally set to marry someone else."

Stella's pulse jumped.

She'd underestimated this seemingly casual foreign businessman. Every question was a trap.

Alexander pressed on. "Everyone knows TING is a workaholic with no time for romance. So, TING, did you hire an actress last-minute?"

Old Mr. Roland grew agitated. "Young man, Stella is my granddaughter-in-law. Why would we lie?"

The interpreter whispered to Alexander.

He locked eyes with Stella. "STAR, your eyes are as pure as starlight. I believe you wouldn't deceive me."

All eyes were on her now.

Including Adrian's.

Stella clasped her hands solemnly. "I am indeed a Roland. I swear it's the truth."

Old Mr. Roland beamed. Adrian's expression turned complicated. Alexander looked thoughtful.

Stella met their gazes without flinching.

Finally, Alexander smiled. "Good, I believe you. STAR, I hear Chinese cuisine is amazing—especially Mapo Tofu. Can you make it?"

"I can. What else would you like?"

The interpreter listed: "Spicy Blood Pudding, Chili Pepper with Century Egg, Stir-Fried Pork with Peppers."

Stella hesitated. "Can Alexander handle spicy food?"

The interpreter laughed. "Don't worry."

"Could we swap the Stir-Fried Pork with Peppers for Sweet and Sour Pork with Pineapple? My husband has a sensitive stomach—he can't handle spice."

The interpreter nodded approvingly, whispering to Alexander.

Approval flickered in his eyes.

A wife would naturally know her husband's dietary restrictions.

Stella sighed inwardly. This wasn't a business negotiation—it was an obstacle course.

"Then Sweet and Sour Pork with Pineapple it is. He's curious about that."

"Alright, I'll prepare dinner."

She practically fled to the kitchen, exhaling in relief. The cutthroat games of commerce weren't her forte.

The kitchen door creaked open softly.

The interpreter smiled gently. "Preparing dinner alone is too much work. Let me help."

Stella was about to decline when sudden realization struck—

This was likely another test.
###Chapter 276: For the One Who Holds Her Heart

She gave a slight nod. "Alright, thank you for your help."

The female translator washed her hands thoroughly before deftly whisking the eggs. "My name is Bianca Cardenas. Bianca as in 'white snow,' and Cardenas meaning 'jade-like radiance.'"

"Bianca," Stella Valentine repeated the name softly. "I'm Stella Valentine."

"What a beautiful name."

"Thank you. My father chose it."

"He must have adored you to give you such a lovely name."

"Yes. I was his favorite."

"Did he walk you down the aisle on your wedding day?"

Stella paused while slicing the pineapple. "He... passed away many years ago."

"My apologies..."

"It's alright," Stella smiled faintly. "What about you? Your Mandarin is flawless—you must have grown up here. How did you end up in Africa? Didn't your family object?"

Bianca shrugged. "Alexander's offer was too tempting. As for family... they never cared where I was or what I did. Should I scramble the eggs first?"

"Either way is fine."

"What about the sweet and sour pork with pineapple? Should I fry the pineapple first?"

Stella explained patiently, "This dish has multiple steps. The pork needs to be sliced, marinated, coated with starch, and double-fried for crispiness. Then we prepare the sauce and thicken it before adding the fried pork. The pineapple goes in last."

Bianca frowned. "Goodness, Chinese cuisine is so intricate."

"It becomes second nature with practice. I used to make it often."

"Regularly?"

"Yes," Stella nodded. "My husband had a sensitive stomach, so I always cooked mild dishes for him. He was picky—no ginger or garlic. Cooking Chinese food without those is practically a crime."

"How did you manage?"

"I stuck to mild recipes. He loved fish—I tried over twenty different preparations..."

Mid-sentence, she stopped. "Am I talking too much?"

Bianca chuckled. "I had my doubts earlier, but now I'm certain. You're unfamiliar with scrambled eggs and peppers, yet so skilled at this complex dish. There's only one reason a woman would master cooking like this—for the one who holds her heart."

Stella laughed softly. "So you were fishing for information."

Bianca admitted freely, "Duty calls. When TING suddenly got married, everyone who knows him was skeptical. Alexander flew in from Africa unannounced just to verify if this marriage is real."

Stella seemed puzzled. "Alexander cares that much about marital status?"

"Absolutely," Bianca said seriously. "He grew up surrounded by gemstones and believes each has a soul. If you treat them merely as profit tools, no amount of money will make him sell. He wants his gems to go to someone who understands珍惜、爱与责任."

Stella recalled her earlier conversation with Adrian Roland.

The man now... had indeed changed. His appearance remained, but his actions had grown more extreme and ruthless.

"Talking about me behind my back?" Adrian leaned against the doorframe, his gaze shifting between them.

Bianca turned to him. "TING, you're a lucky man."

"How so?"

"Your wife loves you deeply."

Adrian's expression flickered as he looked at Stella. She continued prepping ingredients, seemingly oblivious to the remark.

"What makes you say that?"

"The way she cooks for you."

"My grandfather requested it."

Bianca rolled her eyes. "The request came from your grandfather, but your wife chose this elaborate dish specifically for your sensitive stomach. Look at her technique—she's clearly done this countless times."

Adrian's eyes settled on Stella in the kitchen.

She coated pork slices with starch and slid them into the sizzling oil with practiced ease. The array of seasonings on the counter testified to the dish's complexity.

In his memory, Stella was the pampered princess of the Valentine family. During their time together, he'd been the one taking care of her.

Since when could she cook?

He'd never witnessed this before.

Presumably... she'd learned for that man.

Everything he'd yearned for but failed to obtain, that man had received effortlessly. What rose in his chest wasn't just envy—it was something sharper, more corrosive.

"TING, why don't you help your wife? I'll go assure Alexander that you two are genuinely devoted."

Adrian forced a smile as Bianca left. He watched her whisper to Alexander, the older man's skepticism gradually melting into a grin before giving him an approving thumbs-up.

"Go entertain the guests. I can handle this."

Stella used chopsticks to flip the frying pork slices. Hot oil splattered dangerously close to her hands several times.

Adrian strode over and caught her wrist. "Stop. You'll burn yourself."

"If I don't cook, what will our guests eat? I'm used to it." She withdrew her hand and continued working.

Watching her熟练的动作, Adrian's heart churned with conflicting emotions.

"This dish... did he like it?"
###Chapter 277: Her Biggest Mistake Was Marrying Me

The spatula froze in Stella Valentine's hand.

Adrian Roland leaned against the doorframe, his tall frame accentuated by the black suit. "I remember you never stepped into the kitchen before," his deep voice rumbled. "Did you learn for him?"

"..."

"He must be special to make the Valentine heiress cook."

Stella flipped the pork slices, oil sizzling in the pan. "I didn't learn for Mr. Alistair," she said calmly. "It was for you."

Adrian's pupils constricted. "For me?"

"Five years of marriage, and you barely ate at home." Her wrist flicked gracefully, sending the meat swirling. "I knew about your stomach problems, how business dinners left you in pain. Every day I cooked mild dishes, waiting."

She looked up, a ghost of a smile on her lips. "Eighteen hundred days. Even a fool would master it."

His Adam's apple bobbed, speechless.

"Pity," she plated the caramelized pork, "neither you nor Mr. Alistair ever tasted my cooking."

"He hasn't either?"

"No. His stomach handles spice well."

Alexander Heilbronn's laughter floated from the dining room. After a beat, Adrian asked, "What will you do about Lily Savigny?"

Stella's hands stilled.

"It's time she paid," her voice icy soft. "A life for a life."

"I'll handle it."

"Can you bear to?"

His gaze turned glacial. "The moment she killed my father, she signed her fate."

Stella lifted a piece of sweet-and-sour pork to his lips. "Try it."

The tangy aroma enveloped them. Adrian hesitated, then accepted the bite.

"Well?"

"Perfect." His voice roughened. "No need for extra seasoning."

She arranged the dish—golden meat against emerald greens, sprinkled with sesame seeds.

Adrian took the plate. Alexander whistled. "TING, flour on your sleeve."

Bianca Cardenas smirked. "Rumors are true. The office iceberg melts at home."

"Hard being my secretary?" Adrian brushed his cuff.

"Like working in the Arctic!" Bianca rubbed her arms dramatically. "Video conferences could frost the screen."

Alexander's gaze slid toward the kitchen. "But being Mrs. Roland seems... blissful."

"Bliss?" Adrian's laugh was bitter. "Her biggest mistake was marrying me."

Stella approached with the final dish. Adrian stood, their fingers brushing as he took the bowl—

Both froze.

That touch...

Familiar as Mr. Alistair's hand enveloping hers.
###Chapter 278: The Truth Behind the Dual Personality

The crystal chandelier cast a warm glow over the dining room of the Roland family estate.

Edward Roland sat at the head of the table. To his left were Alexander Heilbronn and Bianca Cardenas, while Adrian Roland and Stella Valentine occupied the right side. The aroma of the dishes couldn't mask the tense atmosphere hanging in the air.

Alexander set down his chopsticks, studying Adrian's face.

"Adrian, I've noticed something strange."

"Hmm?"

"You're like two different people." Alexander gestured. "One sharp as a blade, the other gentle as water."

Bianca nodded in agreement. "It's true."

Alexander burst into laughter. "You don't have split personality disorder, do you? No offense—it's just that you seem completely different from the man in those videos."

Adrian gave a wry smile. "My parents only had one child."

"Just joking." Alexander waved his hand. "Let's enjoy these dishes. Though it's a shame there's no wine."

"Your stomach can't handle alcohol," Bianca interjected. "Stella worked hard on this meal. You should eat more."

Edward took a bite and brightened. "Stella, your cooking is exceptional!"

He turned to Adrian with a stern expression. "Don't you dare upset Stella again! Every time you two fight, I don't get to see the children. Three years—Ethan's grown so tall, and Luna can already chase after her brother!"

"Ethan takes good care of his sister," Adrian said softly.

"That's what older brothers do." Edward sighed. "If only your brother were still here—"

Clatter.

Stella's chopsticks fell to the floor.

She bent to pick them up, only to hit her head against the table when she straightened. The table shook violently as Adrian rushed to steady her.

"Does it hurt?"

His fingers brushed her cheek, coming away wet.

"I'm fine." Stella turned away, but tears continued to stream down her face.

Bianca hurried over. "It's swelling. I'll get an ice pack."

"I'll go." Adrian started to rise, but Bianca stopped him. "Stay with Stella."

Edward's voice was thick with concern. "Stella's always been quick to cry, but this time she really hit hard..."

The more Stella wiped at her tears, the more they fell. She suddenly stood. "Excuse me, I need to rest."

Before Adrian could react, she had disappeared into the guest room.

Silence settled over the dining room.

Adrian turned to his grandfather. "You mentioned... I had a brother?"

Edward's expression darkened. "Your mother was carrying twins. You were born healthy, but your brother..." He held his hands apart slightly. "He was this big. Looked perfect, just... wasn't breathing."

Adrian froze as if struck by lightning.

"Your mother never recovered. We agreed never to speak of it—it would only upset her. After she passed, and then with everything between you and Stella... we never told you."

"Where is he buried?"

"I don't know." Edward shook his head. "Perhaps it's better that way. Adrian, you're all I have left. You and Stella must make things work."

Adrian's throat tightened. Between him and Stella stood the shadow of "Mr. Alistair"—a man now dead, yet forever etched in her heart.

"Who arranged the burial?"

"Victor Lefèvre. Stella's uncle."

Adrian's pupils constricted. "Victor?!"

"Yes. Your father entrusted him with it. Do you want to look for the grave?"

Adrian's voice was hoarse. "I should do something for him."

Edward's eyes reddened. "If you find it... light incense for me. After thirty years... I just want him to visit me in a dream."
###Chapter 279: The Mystery of the Match

The air in the dining room was suffocatingly tense.

The bruise on Stella Valentine's forehead stood out starkly. Adrian Roland's brows were furrowed deeply, and Edward Roland looked ashen.

Alexander Heilbronn rose at the perfect moment. "TING, the deal is settled. We'll sign next week."

"Good." Adrian forced a smile.

As they shook hands, Alexander suddenly lowered his voice. "STAR looks familiar. Have we met before?"

"Did you see her in Milan?"

"No, I've never been to Italy."

Adrian replied coolly, "She studied jewelry design there."

Alexander's eyes widened. "'Stellar Whispers' collection! She's the genius designer?"

"Yes."

"My God! If I'd known it was her, this deal would've been done ages ago!" Alexander turned excitedly to Bianca Cardenas. "Darling, we've struck gold!"

Bianca took the hint, linking arms with her husband. "Adrian, go take care of Stella. We'll see ourselves out."

As they left, Adrian heard his grandfather mutter, "Stella's sweet and sour ribs were delicious..."

In the guest room, Stella had just dried her tears.

Her phone vibrated.

"Miss Valentine, congratulations on your new lover." The hoarse voice made her spine stiffen instantly.

"Mr. Xavier?"

"Dr. Melford seems nice. You two make a good pair." A cold laugh came through the line. "Time to fulfill your promise—we found a match."

Stella shot to her feet. "Who?"

"Patience," Mr. Xavier drawled. "Whether they're willing to donate depends on your skills."

"Conditions?"

"Negotiate that yourself." He paused meaningfully. "I've sent the address. Remember our agreement."

Stella suddenly asked, "Are you so afraid of Mr. Alistair seeing me because of that letter?"

Dead silence.

"He's in Houston right now, isn't he?" Her grip tightened on the phone. "That forced breakup letter you made me write was the real knife."

"Silence!" Mr. Xavier roared. "You'll never see him again!"

A knock interrupted them.

Adrian's voice came through the door. "Stella?"

Mr. Xavier's tone turned dangerous. "You lied to me? You're together?"

"I just brought the kids to visit Edward." Stella kept her voice steady. "All I care about is Celeste's donor."

"Remember, I made him 'die' once. I can do it again." The threat was icy. "Including those two children of yours."

The call ended just as a text notification chimed.

Stella stared at the name on the screen, pupils contracting—Victor Lefèvre?!

How could it be him?!

"Stella?" The voice outside grew urgent.

She opened the door to Adrian's worried gaze. He bent to examine her forehead. "Let's go to the hospital."

"No need." She instinctively pulled away, her temple throbbing.

If it really was Victor...

Just days ago, he'd threatened to jump off a building. Now he was supposed to donate part of his liver?

As she wrestled with the thought, a warm hand gently touched her injury.

Adrian's fingertips carried an electrifying warmth as they lightly soothed the bruised skin.
###Chapter 280: The Sunrise Promise

Adrian's fingers lightly brushed her swollen ankle, his brow furrowed. "Does it hurt?"

Stella jerked her foot away, putting distance between them. "None of your concern."

He withdrew his hand, a shadow crossing his eyes. "I was just worried about you."

"Did Alexander and his team leave?"

"Yes, I just saw them off."

Stella exhaled deeply. "Playing pretend is exhausting. Lily seems born for it."

Her phone buzzed abruptly.

Frowning, she walked into the bedroom. An unknown number flashed on the screen.

[Ms. Valentine, regarding the liver transplant discussed on today's program, I must clarify: Even with a living donor, lifelong anti-rejection medication is required. As a physician, it's my duty to provide accurate information.]

Signed, Dr. Melford.

She stared at the message.

The phrasing, the meticulousness—it reminded her so much of Mr. Alistair.

[Thank you, Dr. Melford. I understand now.]

A quick reply came: [May I ask how you obtained my number?]

[Through the production team. I hope this isn't intrusive.]

Her fingers hesitated over the screen.

[Would you be available for dinner next Saturday?]

She studied the words for a long moment.

Perhaps this was an opportunity. Verifying Victor's compatibility would require professional assistance.

[Certainly. My treat.]

[I couldn't possibly let a lady pay. The honor is mine simply to have your company.]

The underlying flirtation set off alarms.

[Dr. Melford, I'm a mother of two with no interest in dating.]

A lengthy pause followed.

[Understood. Though I'd still like to be your friend. Truthfully, a friend dragged me onto that show. Please feel free to consult me on any medical matters.]

Her final reply was succinct: [Okay.]

"Business call?" Adrian's voice came from behind her.

She pocketed the phone. "Has Grandfather Edward retired for the evening?"

"Still enjoying dinner. He particularly likes your cooking."

Stella sighed inwardly. Her plan to leave after the old man went to bed would need revising.

"Just wait a little longer," Adrian said, reading her thoughts.

The phone rang again.

"Ms. Valentine, the client rejected the design proposal. We're on the twentieth revision—"

"Email it to me."

Hanging up, she turned to Adrian. "Is there a computer here?"

"I brought my laptop."

He returned moments later with the device. "Password is 1231."

December 31st. The date sent a jolt through her.

The screen's corner displayed: December 23rd.

Seven days remained until the sunrise promise.
###Chapter 281 I Don't Want to Trouble You

Stella Valentine rubbed her temples, forcing herself to focus. The unread email in her inbox stood out prominently. She clicked it open, and her brows immediately furrowed.

The attachments were filled with densely packed design sketches that made her dizzy. She quickly counted—at least twenty rejected drafts.

"The budget..." She couldn't help but sigh. The client wanted a diamond bracelet but offered a price that couldn't even cover the cost of a platinum chain.

Brilliant Star Group was already in turmoil, and every order was crucial. Victor Lefèvre's recent stunt had only made things worse.

This deal had to be done, even at a loss.

"Young Master, the old master asked me to bring pear soup."

Benjamin Langley's voice came from outside the door. Stella closed her laptop and opened it to find the elderly man holding a celadon bowl filled with crystal-clear snow fungus and pear soup.

"Adrian is showering," she said, taking the bowl. "Should I have him come down later?"

Benjamin's eyes lit up, his tone teasing. "Oh~ Showering? Did I interrupt something?"

"No!" Stella's ears burned. "I was working, and there's only one laptop..."

Benjamin chuckled knowingly, shoving the bowl into her hands. "Of course, just work. Drink the soup while it's hot. I'll go tend to the old master. Don't worry about the children—Luna's already asleep, and Ethan is watching over her."

"Ethan has always been so responsible." Stella cradled the bowl, warmth seeping into her fingertips.

"Oh," Benjamin added before turning away, "your mother called. She said she’s staying with Aunt Qin for a few days."

"Aunt Qin?"

"Yes. She said your line was busy." Benjamin winked. "Make sure the Young Master drinks the soup. It won’t be as effective once it cools."

Stella closed the door and set the bowl on the table. Outside, tree branches swayed violently—she hadn’t noticed how strong the wind had become.

Thud!

A loud crash came from the bathroom.

"Adrian?" She hurried to the bathroom door. "Are you okay?"

"...Fine." His voice was strained.

"What happened?"

"...Can you call Benjamin?"

She turned to open the door but found it stuck. After several attempts, her palms grew sweaty with frustration.

"The door won’t open!" She rushed back to the bathroom. "What do you need? I'll get it for you."

"...I can’t move."

Through the frosted glass, she saw his shadow slumped on the floor.

"Is the weather changing?" His voice was laced with pain.

Only then did Stella notice the howling wind outside. "Yes, it’s really strong."

"Every time the weather shifts... my arm..." His words dissolved into labored breathing.

Her eyes stung with worry. "Let me help you up. You can’t stay on the floor."

"...I’m not dressed." His voice was hoarse. "Stella, I don’t want to trouble you..."

Her heart clenched as if squeezed by an invisible hand. Taking a deep breath, she pushed open the bathroom door.

Steam billowed out. Squinting, she saw Adrian curled up on the tiles.

"Grab onto me!" She crouched down, draping his arm over her shoulders. "Push up—slowly..."

"You..."

"Don’t talk!" She shut her eyes tightly. "Which way is the bedroom?"

"Right ahead... two o’clock."

Gritting her teeth, her slender frame bore his weight as they inched forward step by step.
###Chapter 282: So You Remembered All Along

I struggled to help Adrian Roland into bed. The moment my fingertips brushed his arm, I recoiled as if shocked.

"Cover yourself first." My voice tightened as I turned away.

The rustle of fabric sounded behind me, followed by a suppressed groan. "...Done."

That hoarse voice sent shivers down my spine.

Benjamin Langley had mentioned his sore throat and specially prepared pear soup.

When I turned back, I found him sunken weakly into the mattress. His pale complexion made his lips appear bloodless, beads of sweat glistening at his temples.

"Does it hurt badly?"

He shook his head, Adam's apple bobbing. "Old injury."

"From the car accident?"

"Mhm." His lips twisted slightly. "Looks fine outwardly, but flares up when the weather changes."

Instinctively, I reached for my phone. "Where are your painkillers?"

"At the office." He exhaled unevenly. "Vincent's away, and Penny's just a girl—"

Thunder roared outside as raindrops pelted the windows.

Suddenly, his fingers grazed the back of my hand. "Don't worry."

I jerked my hand away. His suspended fingers slowly curled into emptiness.

"Sorry." His voice grew rougher.

"Was it... serious back then?"

"Can't recall." His gaze fixed on the ceiling. "Woke up with tubes everywhere. Three months in bed."

"Memory loss?"

"Brain trauma, the doctors said." A bitter smile. "Only heard it was a black sedan. Rain messed up the surveillance."

My fingers twisted the fabric of my clothes. "So..."

"Karma, I suppose." His eyes suddenly met mine. "All these years, I've thought this was heaven punishing me."

Rain intensified as his voice blended with thunder. "This useless arm will forever remind me of how I failed you."

"Stop."

"When your cancer attacked, it must have hurt a hundred times worse."

Lightning flashed, illuminating his red-rimmed eyes.

"Still afraid of thunder?" he asked softly.

I watched the rain-streaked window. "I was."

"And now?"

"Now I know fear comes from expecting someone to come." My voice trembled. "Two hundred twenty-seven thunderclaps. One hundred sixteen storms. I counted every one."

His breathing hitched.

"Every time headlights flashed, I thought it was you." My nails dug into my palms. "But it was always... Mr. Alistair who came."

"Stella..."

"He paid my mother's medical bills. Stayed through my chemo." Tears splashed onto my hands. "Even that warmth was stolen."

Only the sound of rain filled the room.

"I'm talking too much today." I wiped my face.

But he smiled. "I like listening."

"To me talk about another man?"

"As long as you were happy then." His voice dropped suddenly. "Better than hearing about those five years..."

Silence fell between us.

Nine years stretched like a chasm, childhood promises long eroded.

"Drink your soup." I stood, heading toward the study. "Benjamin made it special."

When I handed him the celadon bowl, our fingers touched. He drained it in one gulp, throat working.

"Actually..." He spoke abruptly. "My throat isn't sore from illness."

I froze.

"Snuck a cigarette earlier." A self-deprecating smile. "Just like when you'd catch me smoking on the balcony."

Amidst the rain, I heard my heart collapse.
###Chapter 283: I Don't Mind the Trouble

"When did this happen?"

"At the TV station today, while you were talking to Dr. Charles." Adrian's voice was tense. "I avoided the kids and smoked in the restroom. I even walked around outside to air out the smell."

Stella frowned slightly. "How much did you smoke?"

"I lost count. About half a pack."

"Don't do this again."

"Alright. I won't."

"This isn't for me or the kids. It's for you. Do you know how terrifying lung cancer is?"

"But you didn't get sick because of smoking..."

"No, I didn't." Stella smiled bitterly. "During those five years alone, I barely even encountered secondhand smoke."

Adrian's voice lowered. "Do you still feel unwell sometimes?"

"It's manageable. If not for the scar, I might have forgotten about it."

"Don't skip your regular check-ups."

"We'll see. There's too much going on right now." Stella changed the subject. "You should rest. Grandpa still needs you."

"Is Shi's Jewelry in trouble?"

"Yes. There's a difficult client."

"Let me take a look?"

Stella hesitated, eyeing him. "Your hand..."

"It's much better." Adrian's gaze burned intensely. "Stella, let me help you. Please."

She noticed the cold sweat on his forehead, his right hand gripping his left arm so tightly his knuckles turned white.

With a sigh, Stella fetched a warm towel from the bathroom and pressed it against his arm. "This should help. Let me know when it cools down."

A glimmer of moisture flashed in his eyes. "Okay."

She brought over her laptop. "The client wants a platinum and diamond bracelet, but their budget is only ten thousand."

Adrian frowned. "That doesn't even cover the cost."

"We've proposed over twenty designs, but they all exceed the budget."

He studied the designs carefully. "None of these will work. We can't operate at a loss."

"But Shi's Jewelry needs clients right now."

Remembering Victor's previous outburst, Adrian clenched his jaw. "I'll go see him tomorrow."

"I'm coming too." Stella said. "Someone told me Victor is a match for Celeste."

"Did Dr. Charles mention it?"

"That's not important. If he can save Celeste, you won't have to worry anymore."

Adrian smiled bitterly. "Stella, I don't mind the trouble."

"But I do." Her tone was firm. "Let's keep things as they are. I'll handle Celeste's situation myself."

"She's not even related to you..."

"Because of Mr. Alistair." She cut him off. "I have to save her."

"What does she have to do with him?"

"Stop asking!" Stella's voice rose sharply. "If he wants money, I'll give him money. If he wants the company, he can have it. If he wants me to kneel, I'll kneel! As long as he saves Celeste!"

Adrian suddenly curled up in pain, letting out a muffled groan.

Stella rushed to his side in alarm. "What's wrong? Is it— Ah!"

The world spun as he pinned her beneath him. His eyes were bloodshot, his breathing ragged, his entire body burning hot.

"Let me go!" She struggled desperately. "You lied to me!"

"Stella..." He rolled away with difficulty. "The pear soup... was tainted... Get out of here..."

"You—"

"Lock the door..." He collapsed onto the floor, gritting his teeth. "Go! Unless you plan to stay..."
###Chapter 284: Hands Around Her Waist

Stella Valentine flung the door open and rushed out without looking back.

Behind her, Adrian Roland's muffled groan cut through the silence like a dull blade twisting in her chest.

"Benjamin!" Her fingers trembled as she dialed. "The bedroom lock is broken. I can't get out..."

The old butler's hesitant voice came through. "Perhaps you should both rest? I'll call a locksmith tomorrow. Is the young master alright?"

"I'll handle it myself." She hung up abruptly, rummaging through the living room for tools.

The wrench clanged against the lock with a grating screech.

From the bedroom, Adrian's pained growls grew more desperate.

Her gaze dropped to the weeping crabapple brooch pinned to her dress—her most cherished keepsake.

But the man behind that door... was Mr. Alistair's own brother.

Click. The lock gave way.

"Stella!" Benjamin arrived in haste, his robe hastily thrown on. "What's happened to the young master?"

"Call an ambulance!" Her voice shook. "He's in bad shape."

The butler paled. "That shouldn't be... There was only a small amount of deer blood tonic in the pear soup..."

"Deer blood tonic?" Her pupils constricted.

"The master thought you two were reconciling and wanted to... help things along." Benjamin rubbed his hands awkwardly.

Stella pressed fingers to her temple.

What fresh hell was this?

"The young master now—"

"The tonic took effect." She turned away, the tips of her ears burning. "Benjamin, please check on him."

"So you really have been fighting." The old man sighed. "Before, the young master couldn't keep his hands off your waist. Now he won't even step into the kitchen."

Stella froze.

So that's where she'd slipped up.

Another groan echoed from upstairs.

"Mommy!" Little Luna stood rubbing her eyes at the staircase landing. "Is Daddy fighting bad guys?"

Benjamin quickly scooped up the child. "Back to bed, sweetheart."

"I wanna kiss Daddy's boo-boo!" Luna kicked her chubby legs. "He promised me a story!"

Seeing her daughter's stubborn pout—a miniature version of Adrian's—Stella softened.

"Mommy will take care of Daddy," she promised gently.

Only then did Luna settle down, allowing Benjamin to carry her away.

Suddenly, the upstairs fell silent.

Stella pushed the door open with a glass of water in hand.

The rumpled sheets lay empty.

Behind the frosted bathroom door, water cascaded over a hunched silhouette pressed against the shower wall.
###Chapter 285: You Were Worried About Me, Weren't You?

Stella Valentine's legs had gone numb from standing outside the bathroom door.

The sound of running water finally stopped.

When the door opened, she saw Adrian Roland leaning against the wall, his face frighteningly pale.

His left arm hung limply at his side while his right hand gripped his upper arm so tightly his knuckles turned white.

"Why are you still here?" His voice was hoarse.

Stella turned her face away and handed him a towel. "Put this on first."

Only then did Adrian realize his current state.

He gave a bitter smile. "With one hand, I can't—"

"I know," Stella interrupted. "Come here."

She closed her eyes as his heavy footsteps drew nearer.

A chill washed over her.

"You took a cold shower?" She frowned. "With your arm like this—"

"Needed to cool down." His voice was quiet.

Understanding dawned on Stella, her ears burning.

She fumbled to unfold the towel. "Is this height okay?"

"A little higher."

She rose onto her toes, her fingers accidentally brushing against his icy skin.

The faint scent of jasmine lingered in the air as Adrian instinctively lowered his head.

"Done." Stella stepped back quickly, nearly tripping over her own feet.

She peeked through barely opened eyes to ensure the towel was securely fastened.

"Thank you." His voice was uncharacteristically gentle.

Stella felt her cheeks grow warm.

Old Benjamin was right—this version of Adrian was indeed a gentleman.

"Why did you come back?" He sat on the edge of the bed, deliberately maintaining distance.

"I was afraid something might happen to you."

Adrian's eyes brightened. "You were worried about me?"

Stella didn't answer.

"Little Star," he said with quiet amusement, "you still care about me, don't you? Even after how I treated you earlier, you still came back."

Her fingers tightened around the hem of her shirt.

Logic told her she shouldn't interfere.

But he was Mr. Alistair's own brother.

No one in this world was closer to Mr. Alistair than him.
###Chapter 286: The Only Wish

Stella Valentine's gaze lingered on Adrian Roland's face.

Those deep-set eyes churned with emotions she couldn't decipher.

Like a drowning man clutching his last piece of driftwood.

"No particular reason," she averted her eyes. "I'd help anyone in need, let alone the father of my children."

Adrian remained silent for a long moment before forcing a bitter smile. "You're still so kind."

"Can we change the subject?" Stella cut him off. "Is your arm really okay? Should we go to the hospital?"

His face was paler than paper, yet he stubbornly shook his head. "No need."

"Does it hurt?"

"I can bear it."

But his knuckles had turned white from gripping his left arm, his entire body trembling slightly.

"Let's focus on business," Adrian redirected through gritted teeth. "About that platinum bracelet order—I have some thoughts."

Stella's eyes brightened. "What thoughts?"

"Male clients usually customize rings or tie clips. Bracelets clearly target young women."

She frowned. "Why must they be young?"

"Market trends. Women over forty prefer bangles—gold, silver, or jade. Bracelets suit younger tastes. Platinum on a tight budget narrows it to ages fifteen to thirty."

Stella froze.

This was her first glimpse of Adrian's razor-sharp business acumen.

The once idealistic boy had transformed into a strategic entrepreneur.

While stumbling in love, he remained undefeated in the corporate arena.

"Don't look at me like that," he murmured.

Stella snapped back to reality, hurriedly opening her laptop. "Go on."

Clutching his arm, Adrian asked, "Any other client requirements besides budget?"

"None."

"That confirms it. The buyer is a young man—financially strained, likely just starting his career."

Stella gasped. "You deduced that too?"

"Little Star, you're a design genius, but business is war." He paused. "Negotiation hinges on reading your opponent."

The phrase sounded eerily familiar.

"We reverse-engineer the client's situation from his demands to strike precisely."

"Then?"

"Imagine buying Joy Fairsprene a bracelet with only ten thousand. How would you approach the designer?"

Stella instantly understood. "I'd emphasize details—like incorporating monkeys since she's born in the Year of..."

"Now picture Julian Valois after bankruptcy."

Her eyes widened. "Male clients prioritize price and material over design specifics!"

"Exactly." Approval flickered in his gaze. "This order likely came from a struggling man who shopped around before choosing Shi's Jewelry in urgent need of sales."

Layer by layer, the client profile crystallized.

"You dissect business deals like criminal investigations."

Adrian shook his head. "No one's ever said that. There's...no one left around me."

"What do you mean?"

"Parents gone. Lover departed. Children absent." His bitter smile returned. "Who do I have?"

The words stabbed Stella's heart.

"You still have your grandfather. Benjamin Langley." Her voice softened. "Some endure greater loneliness—like those forbidden sunlight. At least you had twenty years of warmth. He was born into darkness."

"You mean...Mr. Alistair?" Adrian's voice trembled.

"I—"

"I know he's the only one in your heart." His eyes dimmed. "I don't hope to replace him. Just one thing—"
###Chapter 287 I'm Willing to Become Him

"What did you say?"

Adrian slowly closed his eyes, his voice barely audible. "Let's do as you suggested. Don't let the children distinguish between me and him."

"..."

"I understand your feelings. You want to preserve the memories of him—it's how you prove his existence. But the children are too young. After three years, they can hardly remember his face. That's why they mistake me for him."

"..."

"I'm not trying to erase his traces. I know he was good to them, and I'm grateful for that. You can trap yourself in memories, but the children still have a long life ahead."

Stella looked up. "What do you mean by 'pure'?"

"Dad loves them. Mom loves them. Grandpa, Benjamin, Grace, Joy—they all love them. It's that simple."

She pressed her lips together, silent.

"Don't forget our agreement with Grandpa. What would he think if the children found out they had two fathers?"

Stella recalled Benjamin's words—Grandpa was already suspicious.

"So, for the sake of the children and Grandpa, pretend that I'm him. Even if it's just acting, will you?"

Stella lifted her head sharply. "But before..."

"At the Houston Grand Hotel?"

"Yes." She nodded. "You were furious then."

Adrian smiled bitterly. "I never thought Adrian Roland would come to this."

"You..."

"But I'm willing." His gaze held hers. "If it means I can stay by your side, even as an actor, I'm willing."

"Then you'd just be his substitute."

"I'd cherish it."

Stella froze.

"Do I resemble him?"

"...Almost identical."

He nodded. "No wonder you often stare at my face, lost in thought."

"Has... it been that frequent?"

"Many times." His voice tightened. "You were looking at me, but I knew—you were seeing someone else through me."

Stella lowered her lashes. "I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize." He shook his head. "Last time, my pride couldn't bear being a stand-in. But today, you cooked for me, insisted on non-spicy dishes, said you'd always be a Roland... Suddenly, pride felt meaningless."

Her heart trembled.

She knew too well the taste of swallowing pride. Years ago, to save Ethan, she had knelt and begged him to come home—that humiliation was carved into her bones.

But this was Adrian Roland.

A legend in Houston's business world, a regular feature in financial magazines.

Where was his pride?

He was willing to become another man's shadow?

"If it means you'll stay, I'm willing to become him." His voice was hoarse. "I can mimic his voice, his habits, everything... I learn fast. Soon, I'll be him."

Today, he was a different man.

Humble to the core, tender beyond recognition—just like Mr. Alistair used to be.

Stella almost laughed.

Was this heaven's compensation?

Was her life heading toward some cliché happy ending?

No.

This wasn't for a perfect resolution—it was for the children and Grandpa.

Adrian seemed to read her thoughts.

"You hate when I smoke, yet you cry every time you see me with a cigarette. So his voice was raspier, wasn't it?"

"By day, you're cold to me, but that night at the hotel, you asked me to stay. Because I wore black—he liked black and the night?"

"Victor's black MV Agusta—that was his bike."

"And Mount Rainier..." His voice turned rough. "I've never been, but it meant something to you two, didn't it?"

Stella shut her eyes briefly. "Using your detective skills again?"

"It's different." His voice softened. "Before, analyzing opponents was for business. Now, analyzing him—it's for you."

"..."

"It's to keep you."

Her nose stung. "You know what? Even the way you talk is like him now."

Adrian gave a faint smile. "Maybe my heart is already moving toward his. Reason tells me to hold onto pride, but emotion has long since molded me into his image."

###Chapter 288 I'm with You

The night was deep, the rain growing heavier.

His gaze burned with an intensity that made her heart race.

Yet it held a tenderness that drew her in.

Adrian Roland pushed himself up from the bed, his movements slow. Stella Valentine instinctively reached out. "Don't move—"

"It's fine. Just turning off the light."

His left arm trembled slightly as he rose, his jaw tightening.

"Let me—" Stella hesitated, her fingers hovering in the air.

Should she help him?

The towel around his waist looked ready to slip at any moment.

Before she could decide, darkness swallowed the room.

"Adrian?"

"Hmm?"

His voice came from the shadows, low and rough.

"What should I call you?"

"...Stella."

"Stella." His voice was suddenly close.

The mattress dipped as he settled behind her.

"Come here."

The scene overlapped with that night at the Houston Grand Hotel. Stella's breath caught.

"What?"

"Come to me."

The voice in the dark matched the one in her memory perfectly.

Her heartbeat roared in her ears.

"Stella, stay tonight."

"I—"

"Don’t worry. I won’t cross the line." Exhaustion laced his words. "I just... want to fall asleep with your scent nearby."

Tears welled in her eyes. She nodded fiercely. "Okay."

"Haven’t slept well in so long." He glanced toward the window. "Too bad there are no stars."

"It’ll clear up! I’ll check the forecast—"

"Don’t." A soft chuckle. "You’re right. It always clears eventually. If you wait long enough... you’ll see the sun again. And you’ll find me."

Lightning split the sky.

Illuminating half his face.

That familiar profile, the gentle eyes—unchanged from her memories.

"...Mr. Alistair."

"I’m here."

"Don’t cry." He pulled her into his arms, pressing a kiss to her hair. "I know what you’ve endured."

The scent of citrus clung to him.

Just like that cologne.

"Leave the company to me. Victor too." His fingers brushed through her hair. "Just rest."

"Mr. Alistair..."

"Yes?"

"I want to save Celeste."

"We’ll see Victor tomorrow." Steel edged his voice. "I’ll drag him to the hospital myself if I have to."

Her fingers trembled as they touched his cheek.

"Don’t cry." He wiped her tears. "Tell me. What is it?"

"We..." Her arms tightened around his neck. "Had a child once."

His body went rigid.

"What?"

"Abroad..." A sob broke free. "The day I heard you died—I collapsed..."

His breathing turned ragged in the dark.

"A five-month-old girl..." Her tears soaked his chest. "I brought her back. Buried her at the peak of Mount Rainier."

"That day with Victor..."

"Yes." She curled against him. "It’s closest to the sky... where the stars could watch over her..."

So that was why.

Why she’d refused to leave during the storm.

"The day Celeste was born..." Her voice shattered. "Our baby left me... Why...?"

His arms shook, his heart tearing open.

"I begged everyone..." Her fists clutched his shirt. "But I still couldn’t keep her..."

The rain drowned out her cries.

In the darkness, two broken hearts held each other tight.
###Chapter 289: Sunrise at Mount Rainier Summit

Adrian tightened his arms, pulling Stella completely into his embrace.

His lips brushed against her damp cheek as he whispered in a trembling voice, "Stella..."

An invisible hand seemed to clutch his heart. The bitterness rising in his throat choked him silent. He felt like a vessel overflowing with anguish, the pain swirling inside him with no escape.

All he could do was repeat her name, listening to her heart-wrenching sobs.

No one understood the depth of losing a child better than he did. This soul-crushing torment—he knew it well.

His only choice was to drown in this sorrow with her.

That child wasn't even his. So why did his chest feel bludgeoned by a blunt weapon?

The agony made him forget the wound on his arm. Forget...he was merely a substitute.

The woman in his arms had cried herself limp, as though she might dissolve into tears.

Adrian lifted her onto his lap, gently stroking her trembling back. "Let it out. It'll help."

"Mr. Alistair..." Her voice was raw and broken.

"I'm here."

"Celeste..."

He held her tighter, his voice soft as water. "I understand why you fought so hard to save her. From now on, she's our daughter. I'll spare no effort."

Boom—

Thunder cracked outside.

The rain seemed endless, like her tears.

Adrian held her until exhaustion claimed her, and she fell asleep in his arms.

Carefully, he laid her on the bed and tucked her in.

Then he settled behind her, wrapping an arm around her waist, breathing in the jasmine scent of her hair.

In his dream, he returned to the summit of Mount Rainier.

That night, the stars had glittered like diamonds, flickering in and out of view.

At sunrise, a blood-red sun leaped from the horizon, like a molten egg yolk.

An ancient banyan tree stood at the peak, its aerial roots hanging like curtains.

Beneath it sat the familiar black MV Agusta Brutale.

......

"Doctor, I slept last night without medication."

The female psychiatrist rubbed her bleary eyes. "Adrian, it's five in the morning."

"I know. But I fell asleep naturally."

She forced herself alert. "How do you feel?"

"Calm," he said, gazing out the window. "Like a windless sea."

"That's progress. Try to identify what helped. Maybe you can wean off the pills—"

"She came back," Adrian interrupted urgently.

"Who?"

"My little star."

The doctor looked puzzled. "An astronomy exhibit?"

"The love of my life."

"She returned to you?"

"Yes...and no." His smile turned bitter. "She loves someone else. Last night, she mistook me for him."

"You're willing to be a stand-in?"

"Willing." His eyes gleamed. "However she comes back to me, I'll take it."

The psychiatrist sighed. "Psychologically, any method that aids your recovery is worth trying. If role-playing brings you peace, so be it."

"But I can only be him at night." He exhaled, relieved. "Still, it's better than nothing."

"What if the real one reappears—"

"He won't." Adrian shook his head. "He's gone."

"...I see."

"Yet I'm still hurting."

"Why?"

"Doctor, have you been to Mount Rainier's summit?"

She considered. "There's a golf course midway. But the peak is treacherous with no attractions. Few go there."

"Could you do me a favor?"

"What is it?"

"Go see the summit for me."

She frowned. "Why not go yourself?"

"I can't."

"Afraid of the dangerous climb?"

"No." His voice tightened. "I'm afraid being near that child will destroy me."

"What child? The summit's no place for children."

Adrian ignored her. "There's a banyan tree. A sunrise... Let me show you."

He took her laptop, fingers flying across the trackpad. Stella used to sketch designs by hand while he digitized them.

Ten minutes later, a bird's-eye view of the summit filled the screen—barren except for gravel and an ancient banyan, with a rising sun where sea met sky.

"That's it." He turned the screen toward her. "Please verify if it's real."

He checked his watch. "The chauffeur will arrive soon. Leave now, and you'll catch the sunrise."

The doctor studied the image, then recalled, "Last time, you mentioned a crabapple tree—"

"Wasn't there."

"This is likely another dream. I'll go, but temper your expectations."

"I understand." He closed his eyes briefly.

The psychiatrist hastily packed her bag. "Wait for my update."
###Chapter 290: Pinning Him Down

The rain outside gradually subsided.

Stella Valentine opened her eyes to find the pillow beside her empty. The lingering warmth in the sheets told her Adrian Roland had left some time ago.

She reached out and touched the indentation where he had lain. Her fingertips met cool fabric.

Sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains, casting dappled patterns across the bedsheet. For a fleeting moment, she remembered those lonely mornings in the past, watching sunlight slowly claim the entire bed.

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

"Stella!" Joy Fairsprene's voice pierced through the receiver. "I've been knocking on your hotel door forever! Where are you?"

Stella rubbed her temples. "I'm not at the hotel."

"What?" Joy's voice shot up an octave. "Then where are you? I have explosive news!"

"I'm at..." Stella hesitated. "The Roland family estate."

Silence.

"Adrian's place?" Joy gasped. "Are the kids there too?"

"Yes."

"Oh my god!" Joy sounded ready to combust. "Did he threaten you with the kids again? That bastard! Send me the address—I'm coming to punch him!"

Stella cut her off. "It's not what you think. Meet me at the office in half an hour. I'll explain."

Hanging up, Stella studied her reflection. Last night's clothes clung to her, wrinkled and damp with the scent of rain.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Miss Stella?" Benjamin Langley's voice called softly. "Are you awake?"

At her permission, the elderly butler entered. His gaze swept over the empty side of the bed. "The young master didn't return last night?"

Stella lowered her lashes. "I wouldn't know."

"This weather..." Benjamin wrung his hands anxiously. "His old injuries always flare up when it changes. Why would he go out..."

Stella caught the implication. "You knew he'd leave?"

The butler flushed. "The master meant well..."

"You tampered with the locks?" Realization dawned. "And that bottle of wine?"

"That was premium deer blood tonic!" Benjamin stomped his foot in frustration. "I poured three glasses! How could it have no effect? Was it counterfeit?"

Stella's ears burned as she grabbed her bag. "Please look after the children. I need to get to the office."

By the time her taxi reached downtown, Joy had already bombarded her with a dozen messages.

The moment Stella opened the office door, a pink blur tackled her.

"Stella!" Joy clung like a koala, sniffing suspiciously. "Good, no trace of that scumbag."

Stella laughed despite herself. "Are you part bloodhound?"

Joy leaned in conspiratorially. "Seriously, he didn't try anything last night?"

"He's CEO Roland now," Stella said calmly, organizing files. "Too busy to bother with me."

"Bull!" Joy plopped onto the desk. "He's been miserable these past few years—"

Seeing Stella's raised brow, she backtracked. "Not that I'm defending him! So...how are things with Dr. Melford?"

"Medically enlightening." Stella smiled faintly. "Romantically? Not happening."

Joy opened her mouth to retort, then froze at Stella's next question.

"Do you know about deer blood tonic?"

Joy spat out her water, frantically dabbing at her blouse. "W-why are you asking?"

Stella studied her knowingly. "So you do."

Joy's face turned scarlet. "Blame Julian Valois! He brought home a bottle last week. I only had a sip..."

"And then?"

"Then..." Joy buried her face in her hands, voice muffled. "I pinned him down."

Stella's folder clattered to the floor.

"Seriously!" Joy lifted her head, eyes blazing. "Just a capful, and the effect was..." She mimed an explosion. "Terrifying!"

Suddenly, Stella remembered Adrian's bloodshot eyes last night—and that final, restrained embrace.
###Chapter 291: No One Could Resist This

Joy Fairsprene slumped on the couch, massaging her lower back with a pained expression. "Stella, I have to confess—Julian hasn't shown up at the office for three days."

Stella Valentine nearly dropped her coffee cup.

"That deer blood tonic is lethal! Ten times stronger than any drug!" Joy winced as she rubbed her sore back. "It's been a week, and I still feel like my spine's broken. I'm throwing that stuff away the moment I get home."

Stella exhaled in quiet relief.

"Wait." Joy suddenly sat upright, eyes narrowing. "How do you know about the tonic? Don't tell me that scoundrel Adrian—" She shot to her feet. "I'll break his legs! Ow—"

A sharp pain made her gasp. Stella quickly steadied her. "It wasn't him."

"Then who? Dr. Charles?"

"No one. I just asked casually."

Joy eyed her skeptically. "Whatever you do, stay away from that stuff. One glass turns you into a wild beast. Two glasses, and you're a raging dragon. Three—"

"What happens after three?"

Joy considered seriously. "If you're alone, you'd end up in the ER."

"What if someone resists the effects?"

"Are you joking?" Joy scoffed. "Even someone as disciplined as me couldn't handle it. No human alive could resist!"

Stella nodded thoughtfully.

Now she understood why Adrian had left abruptly last night.

He was afraid of losing control and hurting her.

Her chest tightened at the memory. She'd mistaken Adrian for Mr. Alistair—and his performance had been flawless.

Even she, who knew Mr. Alistair best, couldn't tell the difference.

Was it because she missed him too much? Or were the brothers truly that similar?

She bit her lip in frustration.

She'd vowed never to forget Mr. Alistair, yet she kept confusing others for him.

But... if the tonic was that potent, who had Adrian gone to after leaving last night?

Lily Savigny? Or someone else?

With his status, he could have any woman he wanted.

Buzz—

Her phone vibrated.

["Wet clothes cause colds. New outfit arriving soon."]

"Who's that?" Joy peered over. "Nobody texts like that except Mr. Alistair... Wait! This sounds exactly like him! Is it—"

Stella checked the number. "Adrian."

"Why's he copying Mr. Alistair's style?"

"Because—"

A knock interrupted them.

An assistant peeked in. "Ms. Valentine, a Miss Chen dropped this off."

A navy-blue box tied with white satin ribbon.

Inside lay a midnight-blue silk dress dotted with white floral patterns, like jasmine blooming against the night sky.

"Gorgeous!" Joy gasped. "Stella, this was made for you! Your friend has impeccable taste!"

"Yeah..."

"Wish it came yesterday. You'd have stunned everyone at the show!"

Another buzz.

["About the diamond bracelet order—check your email."]

She opened her laptop.

A single phrase filled the screen: Bait-and-Switch.

Stella's eyes lit up.

"What's that mean?" Joy frowned.

"Give me ten minutes."

Grabbing her sketchpad, Stella's charcoal flew across the paper. Lines took shape, shadows played—until an exquisite bracelet design emerged.

Joy gaped.

After photographing and sending it to the client, approval came instantly: Proceed with this.

"Done!" Stella exhaled.

"You're amazing!" Joy suddenly brightened. "Oh! I have great news!"

"What?"

"I found a liver donor for Dr. Charles' patient!"
###Chapter 292: Everything Has Its Price

"This case is particularly complicated."

Joy Fairsprene's words made Stella Valentine's heart clench. "Victor Lefèvre?"

"How did you guess?" Joy's eyes widened in surprise.

"Someone tipped me off." Stella's fingertips turned cold. "How did you discover he could save Celeste?"

Joy sighed. "Pure coincidence. After you sent Celeste's blood samples, my father kept screening potential donors. Then Victor jumped off a building and got hospitalized—his blood test showed a perfect match with Celeste!"

Stella's breath hitched.

"You did right by not stopping his suicide attempt. Without that fall, we'd never have found our miracle." Joy bit her lip. "But given his character..."

"There's always a way." Stella's gaze hardened. "No deal is impossible—it just depends on the price."

"He wants the entire Shi's Jewelry!"

"He doesn't want the company." A cold smile curled Stella's lips. "He wants to humiliate me. To crush me underfoot."

Joy grabbed her hand urgently. "Then I'm coming with you."

"No." Stella gently withdrew her hand. "Do me a favor instead."

"Name it."

"Prep the hospital. The moment we reach an agreement, schedule Celeste's surgery immediately." Her voice tightened. "Not a second's delay."

Joy nodded solemnly. "Consider it done."

———

Alone, Stella stood before a dilapidated clinic.

The once-extravagant CEO now sought treatment at this backstreet facility. The peeling wall bore the faded words "Neighborhood Clinic."

"Here for treatment?" A nurse cracking sunflower seeds didn't bother looking up.

"I'm here for Victor Lefèvre."

The nurse finally glanced at her. "He owes three months' hospital fees."

Stella remained expressionless. "I'll settle it after seeing him."

From the innermost ward, Victor's shouts leaked through the ajar door: "Stop hounding me! I'm a goddamn Fortune 500 CEO! I'll pay you back a hundredfold once I get my money!"

The moment Stella pushed the door open, mildew and antiseptic assaulted her senses.

Victor jerked upright, his cast clanging against the metal bedframe. "Here to gloat?"

Stella took a slow seat.

"You took my company. What more do you want?" His eyes gleamed with venom.

"A transaction."

"Ha!" Victor barked a laugh. "What could I possibly have that the great Stella Valentine wants?"

"Your liver."

Victor's face froze.
###Chapter 293: The Appointment

"Say that again?!" Victor Lefèvre jerked upright from the hospital bed, wincing as his wounds throbbed in protest.

Stella Valentine stood before him, her expression unreadable. "It's just a small portion of your liver. It won't kill you."

"Dream on!" Victor's voice cracked with outrage. "Not a chance!"

"No room for negotiation?"

"None!"

Stella turned to leave. "Then rot in this back-alley clinic. Sophia Durand can't save herself now, and Lily Savigny would rather see you dead. No one's coming to collect your corpse."

"Wait—" Panic flashed across Victor's face as he struggled to sit up. "Come back! Let's talk!"

Stella paused at the door, her back to him. "Speak."

His eyes gleamed with greed. "I'll donate... if you hand over Shi's Jewelry."

A cold laugh escaped her. "The company's drowning in debt. What use is it to you?"

"Then come back as their designer!" He slammed a fist against the mattress. "You're so talented, aren't you? Earn the money yourself!"

She turned slowly, her gaze glacial. "You've outdone yourself, Uncle. Truly despicable."

Victor smirked. "You're the one begging, Stella. This person must mean a lot to you. If I refuse, he'll—"

Her nails dug into her palms.

She should've known. Victor was a rabid dog, sinking his teeth into any scrap of leverage.

"Sign it." She flung a document onto the bed.

Victor snatched it up, his face lighting up. "Donation agreement? You agree?" His grin turned venomous as he flipped through the pages. "One more condition."

"..."

"Apologize to William Rubenstein."

Stella's pupils constricted. "What?"

"The man you scarred at the golf club!" Victor crowed. "He's been hounding me ever since. You'll explain it was your doing!"

Ice flooded her veins. The memory of that day clawed at her—if she went back...

"Scared?" Victor tossed the papers to the floor. "Fine. Let your precious patient die."

Her stare burned into the discarded contract.

"Tick-tock," Victor singsonged. "Liver transplants have such a narrow window..."

"Address." The words ripped from her.

His eyebrows shot up. "You're really going?"

"Where is he now?"

"This hour..." Victor checked his watch. "Golden Night Club."

Stella bent to retrieve the agreement, slamming it onto the bedside table. "Sign before I return. Or else—" Her eyes turned blade-sharp. "You'll wish you were dead."
###Chapter 294: My Husband, A Nobody

Footsteps echoed chaotically down the hallway.

"Again?"

"How many times is this now? The hospital should do something..."

"I heard the police couldn't help last time. They just released him after arrest..."

The hospital door was kicked open violently.

Victor Lefèvre trembled, shrinking into the corner in terror.

A dozen burly men in black filed in. The last to enter was a man casually flipping open a Swiss Army knife.

"Mr. Lefèvre, recovering well, I see?"

Victor shook like a leaf. "Mr. Rubenstein, my hand is already ruined..."

William Rubenstein traced the scar on his forehead with a cold smile. "This scar demands one of your hands in return."

"It wasn't me!" Victor suddenly knelt on the bed, pointing at the figure by the window. "It was her! She's the one you want, Mr. Rubenstein!"

Stella Valentine turned slowly to face them.

William's eyes lit up. "Well, well. Ms. Valentine."

The stench of heavy cologne mixed with something rancid assaulted her senses.

Stella fought back nausea as she stepped back. "Mr. Rubenstein, I handled the previous matter poorly. I beg your leniency."

"Tsk, tsk." William licked his lips. "Your uncle sang your praises often..."

Her gaze turned icy.

So Victor had been scheming against her all along.

"Pity," William smirked. "Back then you were Adrian Roland's woman..."

His eyes raked over her with vulgar appraisal.

"Now you've hooked Victor Valence and cost me a concussion." He suddenly advanced. "What? Changed targets again?"

Stella clenched her fists. "This has nothing to do with Mr. Valence."

"Then who? Adrian?"

"Neither."

"Oh?" William's interest piqued. "Which powerful figure is it then?"

"My husband." Stella met his gaze squarely. "An ordinary man."

William burst into laughter. "You rejected two golden bachelors for some nobody?"

"In my heart, he's the best."

William lunged at her. "Perfect timing then—"

A flash of steel.

The Swiss Army knife pressed against his throat.
###Chapter 295: He's Nothing But a Coward!

Stella Valentine's fingers clenched around the Swiss Army knife.

The hospital room was packed with thugs brought by William Rubenstein. Her back pressed against the cold wall as her gaze darted to the only exit—blocked by two burly men.

"Mr. Rubenstein," she said softly, "are you sure you want bloodshed here?"

His greasy hand landed on her shoulder. "Miss Valentine, your uncle's debts need to be repaid."

A flash of steel.

The blade pressed against William's pulsing jugular. She felt the tremor of his Adam's apple as he swallowed.

"Send them out," she hissed. "Or I'll show you how sharp this is."

The room erupted into murmurs.

William raised a hand to stop his men, forcing a laugh. "Miss Valentine, let's talk—"

"Three seconds." She increased the pressure. "One."

A bead of blood welled up. William paled. "Out! Everyone out!"

The sound of retreating footsteps filled the room.

Victor Lefèvre cowered in the corner, lips trembling. "Stella, what are you—"

"Shut up." She didn't look at him. "Mr. Rubenstein, let's negotiate."

He dabbed at his bleeding neck. "Name your terms."

"First, my uncle's debt is erased."

"That's—"

The blade bit deeper.

"Fine! Done!" William gasped. "What else?"

"Second, you'll never speak of my husband again."

William let out a strange laugh. "That helmet-wearing coward? Too scared to show his face—what kind of man is that?"

Her hand twitched.

"Did I strike a nerve?" He seized her wrist. "Riding a junk motorcycle, no real job—letting a woman fight his battles—"

"He's not!" Her voice cracked.

"Then where is he?" William twisted her arm violently. "Let me show you what a real man looks like!"

Stella slammed against the wall.

Her skull hit the hard surface, vision blurring. Through the haze, she saw William's sneering face loom closer.

"Third..." She suddenly smiled. "I want that baseball bat."

William froze. "What?"

"The one he used on you." Her voice was eerily calm. "Did you keep it?"

"You're insane!" He spat. "Trashed it years ago—that piece of—"

Steel flashed.

Stella drove the knife toward his chest with all her strength.

BANG!

The door burst open.

William twisted her wrist, sending the knife clattering to the floor. A backhanded slap sent her crashing into an IV stand.

"You asked for this!" He ripped off his tie. "I'll take you right here!"

Her fingers closed around broken glass.

As William lunged, she pressed the shard to her own throat. "One more step, and I'll bleed out."

He skidded to a stop, face purpling.

"Kill me, and you hang for murder." Blood trickled down her pale neck. "Want to gamble, Mr. Rubenstein?"

The air turned to ice.

William suddenly laughed. "Feisty! I like that!" He adjusted his suit, stepping back. "We'll continue this another time, Miss Valentine."

When the footsteps faded, Stella collapsed.

The glass slipped from her fingers, blood blooming on the floor like a dark rose.

Hugging her knees, she watched dusk settle outside the window.

Mr. Alistair...

Where are you?
###Chapter 296: Stella, I'm Feeling Happy

"Ah—"

A piercing scream shattered the clinic's tranquility.

Stella Valentine's heart plummeted.

She could vividly feel the blade sinking into flesh.

"Help! Murder!" William Rubenstein bolted from the exam room in terror, throwing the entire floor into chaos.

A strained voice whispered in her ear, "Let go."

Only two sounds existed in her world now—the frantic pounding of her own heart and his controlled breathing.

The muffled voice came from beneath a black helmet. "Stella, release it."

She realized the Swiss Army knife hadn't struck William. Instead, it was clenched in a large, well-defined hand.

Blood seeped steadily between the fingers.

His left hand.

"You..."

Footsteps pounded toward them from the hallway.

A powerful force yanked her toward the exit. When William's bodyguard lunged, he effortlessly kicked the man aside.

A motorcycle engine roared to life.

With one fluid motion, he lifted her onto the seat.

The bike weaved through narrow alleys, quickly losing their pursuers.

Wind whipped through her hair.

Her vision blurred when she recognized the dashboard.

Beside it, his left hand still bled.

"Your hand..."

"Just a scratch."

"That's not a scratch with this much blood!"

"Better me than that scoundrel." Amusement colored his voice. "His injury would bring endless trouble."

Her trembling fingers covered his wound.

"Don't touch it."

"Does it hurt?"

"No."

"Liar." She pressed harder. "We need to get this treated."

"Unnecessary."

"You always do this!" Her voice cracked. "You promised to speak up when you're in pain..."

The motorcycle sped westward, leaving the city behind.

His words barely carried over the rushing wind. "Stella...do you know who I am?"

"What?"

"...Never mind."

A bitter smile curved beneath the helmet.

She'd mistaken his identity.

The daylight, the helmet—these details were enough to create illusions.

"What did you say earlier?"

"Nothing." His voice softened. "None of it matters now."

She stubbornly kept pressure on his wound. "But—"

"Do you know what today is?"

Stella froze.

"December 30th." He answered his own question. "My birthday's tomorrow."

"I remember." She repeated urgently. "I truly remember."

Adrian Roland's heart thawed like ice under sunlight.

Even if only one percent of it warmed.

That was enough.

"Stella, I'm happy."

"Fool. How can you be happy while injured?"

"If I could see you every day, I'd gladly get hurt daily."

"You'd end up full of holes!"

"Being a porcupine doesn't sound bad."

"Stop talking nonsense..."

"From this moment on," his voice melted like honey, "porcupines are my favorite animal."

Her heartbeat stuttered.

"Today is my birthday."

"I know." She gazed at the horizon. "I planned to visit Victor Lefèvre first, then go to Mount Rainier. Whether you were there or not, I wanted to be the first to wish you happy birthday."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Let's go now."
###Chapter 297 I know
The car wound its way up the mountain as the breeze grew cooler.

Mist shrouded the summit, with fine threads of rain drifting through the air.

He parked steadily, stretching his long legs before carefully lifting her out.

"Your coat is ruined," he murmured, eyeing the glaring bloodstains on her jacket.

Stella shrugged it off and wrapped it around his injured left hand instead. "It's already dirty anyway."

He let her tend to him without protest, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly.

When she saw the wound on his palm, her breath hitched.

The gash ran deep enough to glimpse bone, blood welling up the moment she loosened her grip.

She quickly bound it tightly with the coat, knotting the sleeve securely.

"Looks like a basketball," he remarked, shaking his bandaged hand.

"I think it's fine," she insisted stubbornly.

His gaze softened. "Alright."

"You're going to the hospital tomorrow."

"Stella."

"Hmm?"

"These past years..."

She looked into the distance. "Just surviving. When I heard about Mr. Alistair's death, I almost couldn't go on."

Adrian's fingers twitched slightly.

"I know you're not him," she said quietly. "You're Adrian Roland."

The mountain breeze swept past, tousling the loose strands of hair at her forehead.

"Thank you for saving me today." She smiled faintly. "Just like Mr. Alistair did back then."

He removed his helmet, revealing weary eyes.

"New bike?"

"Bought it this morning."

The memory of the pear soup last night made her ears grow warm. "About yesterday..."

"Cold shower accident," he cut in. "Not useless."

Stella abruptly rolled up his sleeve.

Dark bruises mottled his elbow in a disturbing pattern.

"The pear soup was too strong," he explained softly. "Pain keeps me awake."

Her fingertips trembled. "You endured this all night?"

"Yeah. It worked."

"Where did you go after?"

"Saw my therapist." His gaze drifted to the sea of clouds. "Had a dream last night."

"What about?"

"This place." His voice was rough. "Never been here before, yet every detail matched."
###Chapter 298: Thoughts in the Night

"Even my psychiatrist found it hard to believe." His lips curved slightly, but his eyes remained cold. "To be honest, I think it's absurd myself."

Stella Valentine clenched the hem of her shirt. "Are you sure you've never been to Mount Rainier before?"

"Never."

"..."

"You don't believe me either?" He gave a self-deprecating smile. "It does sound bizarre."

After a brief hesitation, Stella asked, "Could you give me your psychiatrist's contact?"

Adrian Roland's gaze turned icy. "Are you sick?"

"No."

"The children—"

"They're fine." She interrupted. "I just have some questions to ask."

Understanding dawned instantly. "About Mr. Alistair?"

She bit her lower lip and nodded slightly.

"How straightforward." His laugh was bitter. "You're not even trying to hide it now."

"Honesty is better than misunderstanding."

"What misunderstanding?"

"..."

"That you're nice to me because I resemble him? That you're playing along just for Grandpa's sake? That I mean nothing to you?"

Stella turned her face away. "Why must you—"

"Why spell it out?" His voice tightened. "Stella, clarity is good. It reminds me every smile of yours was meant for him."

The night wind rose, scattering her unspoken words.

"I don't know what to say."

"Don't say anything." He looked into the distance. "I own my mistakes. Even if you want my life, I'll give it."

"That's not what I want." Her voice was feather-light. "For Grandpa, for all the employees... just stay alive."

Dusk deepened, the chill growing sharper.

He took off his coat and handed it to her. "Put this on."

"I don't—"

"I understand." He cut her off. "You're saving yourself for him. But you can't afford to get sick. Victor's agreement isn't signed yet. The children still need you."

She finally accepted the coat.

The familiar scent of tobacco and alcohol enveloped her.

So this was it.

He extended his phone, the screen showing an active call. "My psychiatrist. Talk to her. I'll be over there."

His retreating figure beneath the oak tree looked profoundly lonely in the fading light.

"Mr. Roland?" A gentle female voice came through the phone.

Stella snapped back to attention. "Hello, I'm—"

"I guessed." The psychiatrist chuckled. "You must be Ms. Valentine."

Her breath hitched. "How did you—"

"Professional instinct." The doctor's tone remained soothing. "Don't worry, we have confidentiality agreements."

Stella tightened her grip on the phone. "Doctor, I have a question."

"Go ahead."

"Do twins really share a psychic connection?"

A brief silence followed. "There's no scientific consensus. But identical twins share the same DNA, and there have been remarkable documented cases."

"Then..." Her voice trembled. "Can a brother's memories appear in his twin's mind?"

The night wind scattered fallen leaves as the distant figure remained motionless.
###Chapter 299: I Can Lie to Myself Until Death

The female doctor's voice came through the phone. "Is this about Mr. Roland's dream of Mount Rainier?"

Stella's grip on her phone tightened. "He told you?"

"He came to see me this morning, begging me to verify the details at the summit." The doctor paused. "What's even more astonishing is that his sketch matched the actual landscape perfectly."

Stella's breath hitched.

"Miss Valentine, does Mr. Roland have a twin brother? These memories—"

"Just speculation." Her voice was strained. "He's never been there before."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Miss Valentine, I have a question." The doctor hesitated. "Did Mr. Roland's brother... ever see a massive flowering tree? One covered in pale pink blossoms, petals drifting like snow..."

Stella shuddered.

Weeping Crabapple.

The tree that had witnessed her final moments with Mr. Alistair.

"Yes." Her voice trembled. "Huge. Beautiful."

"Incredible." The doctor exhaled. "In all my years of practice, I've never encountered twins who share memories."

Stella's gaze drifted toward a distant figure. "How is he... now?"

"Emotionally unstable." A sigh. "But this morning, he mentioned sleeping well last night."

A bitter smile touched Stella's lips.

Even the insomnia was identical.

"Miss Valentine, you're his medicine." The doctor's tone turned grave. "Even if you must leave... be gentle. Otherwise—"

"Otherwise what?"

"Self-harm. Suicide. Dissociation... All possible."

After hanging up, Stella realized Adrian was no longer where she'd left him.

She turned, spotting his silhouette farther away.

He stood motionless on the gravel.

"Is this the place?" His voice floated back without turning. "Where our child rests?"

Her pupils constricted.

This unmarked patch of earth—she'd never told a soul.

"How did you—"

"Instinct." His whisper was barely audible. "Standing here... my heart aches."

Night deepened, city lights sprawling below them.

"Will you tell me?" He turned abruptly. "About your past with him."

Stella froze.

"I want to know how good he was." A step closer. "And I want... to become him."

Moonlight blurred his edges, merging with the shadow of her memories.

"Even if it's just acting." A quiet laugh. "One more day with you... worth it."

"Fakes remain fakes."

"But I'm willing." His gaze burned. "What's wrong with lying to myself forever?"

The night breeze carried a familiar scent.

"Stella." His voice softened. "Will you play this charade with me?"
###Chapter 300 Happy Birthday

Stella Valentine gazed at the distant city lights, her lips curving into a bittersweet smile.

"My story with him..." She paused. "Was just ordinary days filled with simple routines."

Adrian Roland glanced at her. "Ordinary?"

"Yes." She nodded softly. "We rented an old apartment with basic furniture. He worked long hours, but he always remembered what the kids liked. He always noticed when I was upset."

"That's it?"

"That's it." Stella smiled faintly. "Remember what I told you? You never understood women."

Of course he remembered.

It was when Lily Savigny had her miscarriage. He had gone to confront Stella in anger.

"Women don’t crave wealth or luxury," she said, eyes fixed on the stars. "Just a home that shelters them from the storm. Back then, Victor Lefèvre took my house. Lily stole my place. Mr. Alistair was the one who gave me refuge."

Adrian suddenly understood. "Room 1231 at Houston Grand Hotel?"

"Yes."

"No wonder you reacted so strongly when I booked that room."

"It was our secret. Just his and mine." Her voice was barely a whisper. "Now... it's all gone. Every trace of him erased. Only I remember."

The mountain breeze picked up, but the night remained clear, scattered with stars.

"We did the simplest things," she said, tilting her face toward the sky. "Watched stars together. Waited for sunrise. I cooked for him. Waited for him to come home. No gourmet feasts. No mansions or luxury cars. But that was the life I wanted."

Adrian's expression darkened. "Are all women like you?"

"I don’t know." She shook her head. "I only know I am."

"Lily wanted the Roland family’s status. Wendy Evans chased wealth and comfort..." He laughed bitterly. "But you? You asked for nothing."

"Wanting nothing is the hardest of all." Stella pointed at the sky. "Look. Aren’t the stars beautiful?"

Adrian followed her gaze. "They are."

"What time is it?"

"Almost midnight."

So late already.

Four years had passed in the blink of an eye.

"Now?"

"Exactly midnight."

"He won’t come." Her voice was feather-light. "Not ever again."

She murmured to the stars, "Goodbye, Mr. Alistair."

"..."

"Happy birthday."

Adrian froze. "...To me?"

Stella didn’t answer. "Let’s go down."

He nodded. "The wind’s getting colder."

She knelt, fingertips brushing the ground. "Sweetheart, are you happy playing among the stars? If you miss Grandpa, go find him. If you miss me..." Her voice cracked. "Come visit me in my dreams."

Adrian stood behind her, watching her fragile frame. A sharp pain stabbed through his chest.

"Don’t blame your father," she whispered. "He has his own path to walk."

When she stood, she found Adrian clutching his chest, face pale.

"Does your hand hurt again?"

He shook his head. "Every time you mention the child, my heart aches."

"...Let’s go."

"Not staying for sunrise?"

"No." Her voice was barely audible. "Never again."

Without him by her side, what was the point of dawn?

The descent was quiet, the city below empty in the midnight hush.

"Let’s get your wound treated first," Stella said.

Adrian refused. "No."

"Why not?"

"William Rubenstein will be hunting for whoever injured him. The knife wound is the only clue. If they trace it to me, there’ll be trouble."
###Chapter 301: I Can't Let You Take That Risk Again

Stella's eyes flickered with understanding.

She instantly grasped Adrian's concern.

The business world was a battlefield. If William Rubenstein discovered their deal with Alexander Heilbronn, he would sabotage it. All their carefully laid plans would crumble.

"Signing the contract first is wise," she murmured.

Adrian shook his head.

"You think that's what worries me?"

"Isn't it?"

His long fingers brushed through her hair as he spoke in a low voice, "What I fear is William discovering my weakness."

Stella's heart skipped a beat.

"I've made too many enemies over the years." Adrian's gaze darkened. "If they learn about you, they'll use you against me."

His fingertips felt cold against her skin.

"I can give up money and jewels, but William..." He paused. "He has no moral boundaries."

A chill ran down Stella's spine.

"How many people have you crossed?" Her voice tightened.

"Too many to count." His lips curled into a bitter smile. "In business, it's kill or be killed."

She suddenly gripped his arm.

"You weren't like this before!" Her voice trembled. "You used to believe in mutual success—"

"That was then." His eyes turned sharp as blades. "Now I want the summit."

"Why?"

"Because only at the top can I protect those who matter."

Stella's breath caught.

She remembered the gentle Adrian from years past.

"Did Lily change you?"

"Does she deserve that credit?" He scoffed.

The ringing phone shattered the tension.

Adrian glanced at the caller ID and frowned.

"Uncle Xavier."

He moved to the window, lowering his voice deliberately.

"I'm out."

Mr. Atlante's probing voice came through. "Alone?"

"Yes."

"Grant said you skipped the office today." A pause. "Don't tell me you're with that woman."

Adrian's expression hardened.

"I had a therapy session."

"How did it go?"

"Improving."

After hanging up, his eyes darkened further.

How did Xavier know about Victor Lefèvre?

Turning back, he found Stella staring at his phone.

"What's wrong?"

She shook her head. "Nothing."

But her fingertips trembled slightly.

A sudden realization made Adrian's gaze turn razor-sharp.

"Stella, there's something I've never understood."

"What?"

"My parents' car accident..." His voice turned icy. "Lily couldn't have orchestrated it alone."

Stella's pupils contracted.

"You mean—"

"There's someone else behind it." He stared at his phone. "And they might be closer than we think."
###Chapter 302: Only Useless in Front of You

Mr. Xavier remained silent for a long time.

Heavy breathing echoed through the phone.

"Uncle Xavier, I must get to the bottom of this," Adrian said, his voice low.

"Adrian, you've disappointed me."

"Shouldn't I investigate my parents' deaths?"

"You know what I'm referring to." Mr. Xavier's voice suddenly sharpened. "I asked about your schedule. Why deflect? If you weren't guilty, why change the subject?"

Adrian tightened his grip on the phone.

"Uncle, I don't want to keep making mistakes."

"Mistakes?" Mr. Xavier scoffed. "I saved your life twice. Gave you everything I had. Built you into the man you are today. That's a mistake?"

"I'll never forget what you've done for me. But—"

"Enough!" Mr. Xavier cut him off. "Last time, you said it was all an act with her. To put the old man at ease."

"...Yes."

"How long?"

"The doctors say Grandfather doesn't have much time. I want him to pass peacefully."

"So once he's gone, you'll cut ties with her?"

Adrian's knuckles turned white.

"I'm giving you one chance. Don't disappoint me."

The call ended abruptly.

Adrian stood motionless.

"Trouble at the company?" Stella asked softly.

She had deliberately stepped away earlier.

Adrian pocketed his phone and forced a smile. "Just a minor issue."

"Really?"

"Stella," he chuckled, "I only seem useless in front of you. In business, I'm the 'Grim Reaper' who makes people tremble."

She recalled Penny's exaggerated expression when mentioning that nickname.

Clearly, he was ruthless at work.

Adrian extended his left hand. "We're at the estate. Time to act."

Stella hesitated, then placed her hand in his.

His left hand lacked the strength of his right, holding her loosely.

"Mommy!" A small figure crashed into her arms.

Ethan dashed toward Adrian. "Daddy!"

Stella quickly intercepted her son. "Daddy's tired. Let him rest."

"Did Daddy go fight bad guys again?" Ethan blinked.

Benjamin hurried over to usher the children away. "Young master, that's not something to ask."

"Why? Daddy always tells me."

Benjamin smiled mysteriously. "Does Daddy look exhausted?"

Ethan studied Adrian. "He has dark circles."

"And Mommy? Is her face red?"

"It is! Mommy, you're blushing!"

Before Stella could explain, Benjamin distracted them. "The sweet soup is ready. Want some?"

"Three bowls for me!" Ethan's attention immediately shifted.

"What about Luna?"

"Are there eggs?"

"Of course. Cooked just for you."

The children skipped away happily with Benjamin.

Glancing back at their joined hands, Benjamin smiled warmly. "Should've happened sooner. If I'd known pear soup worked this well..."

Mention of the soup brought instant awkwardness.

Stella's cheeks burned.

Explaining would only make it worse. The charade had to continue—if it made Grandfather happy, so be it.

Adrian shifted to shield her. "Benjamin, we'll freshen up first."

"Of course. Though Miss Stella has no change of clothes..."

"She can wear mine." Adrian tightened his grip naturally. "We'll sort it tomorrow."

"Very well."

Stella suddenly tugged his sleeve. "Wait."

"What is it?" He leaned down.

She whispered near his ear, barely audible. "Today's sweet soup... it's not that pear soup, is it?"
###Chapter 303: Mr. Alistair, the Deepest Wound in Her Heart

Adrian Roland suddenly realized something, his Adam's apple bobbing twice. "Benjamin."

"Yes, young master?"

"Tonight's dessert soup..."

"Sweet fermented rice balls with goji berries and red dates." Benjamin smiled knowingly. "Don't worry, it's just regular dessert tonight."

Stella Valentine's tense shoulders finally relaxed.

Last night's spiked pear soup had forced Adrian to dig his fingers into his wounded arm just to stay conscious. If it happened again...

Her gaze flickered to the bloodstained bandage on his right hand.

"Don't fret, little star," Benjamin whispered. "The old master specifically instructed—last night's dosage..." He glanced at their exhausted expressions and chuckled. "Seems it was too strong."

Stella's ears burned.

Adrian remained impassive. "Thank you, Benjamin."

"Anything for you two! This old bones would brew soup every day if it makes you happy!"

From the kitchen came Luna's sweet voice: "Grandpa Benjamin, can I have one more sugar?"

"Coming!" Benjamin hurried off. "Don't touch the stove, little one! Hot-hot!"

The childish repetition made Stella stifle a laugh.

"Benjamin's parenting skills," Adrian murmured, "have improved since my childhood."

"Did he baby you like this too?"

"Me?" Adrian shook his head. "I was too wild. Got spanked often."

"Benjamin spanked you?"

"Tag-team discipline." Nostalgia flickered in his eyes. "Back then, I wished for a sibling."

Stella's smile froze. "You... really wanted that?"

"Mm. Preferably an older brother." His gaze grew distant. "Someone to share the burden." Abruptly, his tone shifted. "Stella, about that car accident..."

"What about it?"

"There are inconsistencies." His brow furrowed. "I'll tell you once I verify them."

They wordlessly ignored the newly changed lock, entering the bedroom one after another.

"You shower first." Adrian lifted his injured hand. "Can't get this wet."

"Where's the first aid kit?"

"Downstairs." He lowered his voice. "Don't let Grandfather know."

Stella nodded, but he stopped her as she turned.

"Wear my shirt." He gestured to the closet. "All clean."

The sparse wardrobe revealed its owner rarely stayed here. Stella's fingers brushed a white dress shirt, recalling how she'd refused his jacket earlier.

"I'll use a towel as padding," she said softly.

Only when the shower turned on did Adrian unclench his right hand.

The knife wound glared angrily, blood and sweat soaking through the bandage. He wiped it with tissues, a bitter smile twisting his lips.

That bastard Wang had struck hard.

Had he arrived a second later, William Rubenstein might've been dead. And Stella... His chest tightened at the thought.

Mr. Alistair would always be her forbidden scar.

The water stopped.

Stella emerged in his shirt, damp hair clinging to her shoulders. The strategically placed towel revealed only a slender neckline.

"Are the children asleep?"

Adrian listened. "Yes."

"I'll get the first aid kit." She turned, but his grip tightened around her wrist.

"Stella." His voice roughened. "Why that shirt?"

It was the same style he'd worn when they first met.

Her lashes fluttered. "...Coincidence."

The first aid kit gleamed faintly in the dark downstairs. She tiptoed down, unaware of the man watching his bloodied palm with darkened eyes.

Mr. Alistair's thorn would be plucked out—by his own hands.
###Chapter 304: I'll Break the Arm He Dared to Touch You With

The first aid kit was hidden deep inside the antique cabinet in the living room corner.

The Roland family estate retained old-fashioned furnishings. Moonlight cast dull reflections across the carved cabinet's surface.

Her fingertips traced the uneven patterns on the cabinet doors, like deciphering some ancient code.

She didn't dare turn on the lights, fearing to alert Grandpa Edward and Benjamin downstairs. The floral motifs under her fingers gradually revealed themselves as orchids.

Grandma Roland's maiden name contained "orchid," so the old man had filled the estate with them. This devotion persisted even in the furniture carvings.

Suddenly she remembered Mr. Alistair once promising to plant her an entire garden of roses.

As for Adrian...

She shook her head, forcing the memories away. The first aid kit's metal clasp gleamed coldly in the dark. After retrieving it carefully, she fetched a glass of warm water from the kitchen.

The aging stairs creaked softly with each step.

"Grandpa Benjamin, what's Mommy doing?"
"Shh—she's taking care of Daddy."
"Is Daddy sick?"
"Well..."

Benjamin's knowing smile recalled the old man's decades-old deer blood tonic. Apparently it worked—the young couple's tension had noticeably eased.

Stella missed the downstairs conversation. Climbing upstairs with the water, she found Adrian typing one-handed on his laptop.

"Wound doesn't hurt anymore?" She set down the kit, noticing complex architectural blueprints onscreen.

He closed the laptop. "It's nothing."

"The kids fell right asleep—no trouble adjusting." She teased deliberately. "Unlike certain people who can't sleep with a different pillow."

His low chuckle rumbled. "True. Remember when I took you stargazing on that Ferris wheel in high school? You fell asleep at the highest point."

"Three all-nighters before midterms—you'd have crashed too."

"But the stars were spectacular that night." His voice darkened abruptly. "If we'd just stayed friends..."

"None of what came after would've happened." She finished the thought. "And Lily wouldn't have orchestrated that car accident."

Adrian's gaze turned glacial. "New leads suggest someone else might've been behind it."

"Besides Victor and Sophia?"

"Maybe they didn't want the Roland fortune." He mused. "But rather..."

Her hands trembled while unwrapping the bandage. "Let's treat your wound first."

When the antiseptic touched his injury, his muscles tensed visibly. Seeing the angry gash, her voice shook. "I didn't realize I cut so deep."

"Did you really want to kill that bastard?"

"I just..." She bit her lip. "Couldn't bear hearing his disgusting words."

Adrian suddenly gripped her wrist. "Where did he touch you?"

"Just... my waist."

"Which hand?" His voice frosted over.

Stella froze. That tone, that expression—identical to Mr. Alistair's.

"Did I scare you?" His demeanor softened again. "Don't worry. I'll handle this. Victor's donation agreement will reach the hospital by tomorrow."

"Is this... repayment?"

"Penance." He met her gaze squarely. "For every wrong I've done you."

Moonlight through the curtains silvered his profile. For one fleeting moment, she couldn't distinguish which man sat before her.
###Chapter 305: Just Missed You

Adrian Roland blocked her with a single sentence.

Stella Valentine clutched her phone, staring at Victor Lefèvre's number. This was the seventh attempt.

Still switched off.

For two whole days, Victor had vanished without a trace.

That afternoon, two police officers arrived at Brilliant Star Group.

"Miss Stella Valentine?" The lead officer flashed his badge. "We received a report of violent coercion. We need your cooperation."

William Rubenstein had actually gone to the police.

She gestured for her assistant to prepare tea and led the officers to the conference room.

"Do you know William Rubenstein?"

So that was the PIG's real name.

She nodded. "A long-standing client."

"He claims you and another man assaulted him at the hospital."

Stella recounted the events truthfully.

"...He threatened me with a knife first."

The officer took notes. "Surveillance footage confirms that. But the man who intervened kicked him hard enough to cause a concussion. We need to locate him."

Her fingers turned icy. "I'll cover all medical expenses."

"We can't close the case without the suspect's statement."

A knock interrupted them.

"Mr. Roland is here," the secretary announced.

Stella shot to her feet. "Tell him to leave the documents and go."

"In such a hurry to dismiss me?" Adrian already stood in the doorway.

His gaze swept over the officers, comprehension dawning instantly.

Stella lunged into his arms, grabbing his hand to wrap around her waist.

The hem of his trench coat perfectly concealed his right hand.

"Your assistant could've delivered the papers," she cooed, tilting her face up.

Adrian tightened his hold, pressing her against his chest. "Wanted to see you."

She blinked rapidly behind his back.

"The police are here about William Rubenstein," she whispered shakily.

Adrian stroked her back. "That trash deserves worse."

"It's all on camera."

"My wife has been terrified," he told the officers. "Haven't slept properly since."

The secretary's eyes bulged.

Wife?!

"You're married?"

"With two children." Adrian smiled.

"Do you own a motorcycle?"

"We have family vehicles." He feigned confusion. "Is a motorcycle relevant?"

The senior officer stopped his colleague. "We're done for today."

Stella's legs trembled as she escorted them out.

The moment the door closed, she wrenched free.

"That was an emergency—"

"More like wish fulfillment." Amusement glinted in his eyes.

She hissed, "How dare William file a report?"

"His injuries were severe this time." Adrian suddenly frowned. "You said 'last time'? Who hurt him before?"
###Chapter 306: A Belated Realization

The answer was obvious.

Stella's silence spoke volumes.

Adrian's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "I always seem... to be one step behind."

"What do you mean?"

"I met you first. Married you first. But everything I should have done for you—Mr. Alistair did it before me." His voice was low. "People only remember the first."

Stella avoided his gaze, quickly moving to her desk. Her fingers tapped restlessly on the mouse. "Let's not talk about this."

"Fine." He placed the documents on the table. "Arrange for the children's return as soon as possible."

Her eyes landed on the flamboyant signature—Victor Lefèvre.

"How did you manage this?" She looked up sharply.

"It doesn't matter." He tapped the agreement lightly. "Just focus on preparing for the surgery."

"Did you threaten him? Or—"

"Stella," he interrupted, "take care of yourself."

Her hands trembled as she locked the papers in the drawer.

"The diamond bracelet project—"

"It's already in production." A thought suddenly struck her. "Thank you for the hint."

A flicker of amusement crossed his eyes. "You're smarter than I thought."

With the weight lifted from her chest, she relaxed for once. "You were right. Male clients prioritize cost-effectiveness. When I asked what flowers girls like, he immediately suggested jasmine designs."

"Using smaller diamonds cuts costs while keeping the sentiment."

"You understand consumer psychology well."

"Business is mind-reading." His gaze softened. "Just like your StarWhisper."

Her smile faltered. "That's all in the past."

"Little Star," he asked suddenly, "did you and Mr. Alistair... design anything together?"

"...A brooch."

"The design?"

"Weeping crabapple."

"And now?"

"Put away."

The light in his eyes dimmed. "Like StarWhisper?"

"..."

"I should go." She looked away.

"Kicking me out?"

"You have work at the company."

With a wry smile, he turned. His retreating figure radiated exhaustion.

Stella massaged her temples.

The pain had come from him. So had the tenderness.

This agreement must have cost him immense effort, yet she'd rushed him out.

How ironic.

Right and wrong between them had long blurred.

For the children. For Grandpa Edward.

This was how it had to be.

......

In the parking lot, two men in police uniforms whispered.

"That was quick. I expected some office passion."

"Bet he got his hands all over her under that suit."

"Is she stupid? Ditching a rich, handsome CEO for some faceless loser?"

"Heard they hooked up years ago. Met at the golf club."

"Two kids and still cheating? Adrian's got a solid green hat."

"Maybe he's bad in bed? That's what really matters for a man."

"No wonder it was fast—can't last!"

"Mr. Rubenstein wanted info, but her lips are sealed."

"Don't push it. Adrian Roland isn't someone to mess with."

They hastily stripped off the uniforms and tossed them into the trunk.

The car roared to life and sped away.
###Chapter 307: Blind to One's Own Blessings

William Rubenstein lay on the hospital bed, his forehead wrapped in bloodstained bandages, his face dark with fury.

"Adrian Roland?!"

He slammed his palm against the bed frame, rattling the IV stand. "When did she get involved with Adrian again?"

The two fake policemen shrank back. One stammered, "Mr. Rubenstein, we don't know. We were halfway through questioning when Adrian showed up. His glare was like a knife—we had to leave before we got exposed."

"Useless!" William spat. "That bitch didn't say a word?"

"Not a damn thing. She'd rather pay compensation than reveal who the man was."

William suddenly grinned, his expression chilling. "Interesting."

"So... do we keep investigating that guy?"

"Of course!" William yanked the IV needle from his hand, his face contorted with rage. "I won't take two beatings for nothing. Once we find that helmet-wearing bastard, I'll drag him straight to Adrian. They say Adrian shows no mercy—let's see how he deals with his wife's lover!"

"But... all we have is that wound on his right hand..."

"Check every hospital! A wound that severe can't be treated at home." William's eyes narrowed. "Focus on Victor Valence. The more I think about it, the more it feels like him."

"Yes, Mr. Rubenstein."

"And that bastard Victor Lefèvre—still no sign of him?"

The two exchanged uneasy glances. "Vanished into thin air..."

William waved them off impatiently. "Forget him for now. Go find that man!"

——

Penny Anderson gripped the steering wheel, stealing glances at the rearview mirror.

On the way there, her boss had been in a frantic hurry. Now, he sat in the backseat like a ghost, eyes closed, silent.

The oppressive atmosphere made her hair stand on end.

"Penny."

The sudden voice from the backseat startled her.

"Yes, Mr. Roland?"

Adrian kept his eyes closed. "Let me ask you something."

"Go ahead..." She swallowed hard. "But could you not use that tone? It sounds like you're about to fire me."

He slowly opened his eyes, rubbing his temples. "Can broken glass... ever be whole again?"

"Of course!" Penny perked up immediately. "Once I find that bastard, I'll tie him up like a mummy!"

"You don't hate him for leaving without a word?"

"I do! That's why I'll beat him up first, then ask for an explanation!"

Adrian chuckled.

"Why are you laughing? At my stupidity?"

"Stupidity is good." He turned to the window. "Your boyfriend doesn't know how lucky he is."

Penny nodded vigorously. "Exactly!"

As the car entered the underground garage, she suddenly remembered something. "Oh, Mr. Roland, we received an unfamiliar wire transfer this morning. The sender claimed they bought a used Porsche."

"Refund it." Adrian frowned. "Must be a mistake."

"But the sender insists it's correct." Penny hesitated. "They said the payment was meant for StarShi's account first, but it couldn't go through..."

Adrian's head snapped up.

"I checked. The primary recipient was StarShi, and our company was secondary." She treaded carefully. "Could it be... Ms. Valentine sold the car?"

"She doesn't drive."

"Then... did you buy a car under her name before?"

Adrian shot her a cold look. "Do I look like someone who needs to sell cars for money?"

"No, no!" She waved her hands frantically. "It's just strange—someone connected to both you and Ms. Valentine, who could afford a Porsche..."

"Flood-damaged car." Adrian cut her off. "Four years ago, the basement garage was completely submerged."

Penny gasped. "That whole garage of luxury cars..."

"I was in the hospital. Didn't see it." His tone was flat. "By the time I was discharged, everything had been cleared out."

Tens of thousands in unpaid balances...

A used Porsche...

Adrian's eyes darkened.

"Contact that buyer." He stood abruptly. "Now."
###Chapter 308: She Worries About Me

The night fell, and the Atlantis Seafood restaurant glowed brightly under the lights.

"Mr. Roland, he's already here." Penny Anderson pressed the brakes and glanced at the backseat.

Adrian Roland closed the file in his hand and pushed the car door open.

"Should I wait for you?"

"No need." He adjusted his cufflinks. "Pick up Stella and take her back to the old house."

Penny froze. "Stella?"

Adrian frowned slightly. "Stella Valentine."

"Oh, Miss Valentine—"

"Call her Mrs. Roland from now on." His tone left no room for argument.

Penny's eyes widened. "You and Miss Valentine—"

"Have been married for nine years."

"What?!"

Adrian didn’t explain further, turning toward the restaurant. The night breeze brushed against the hem of his suit jacket, and the corner of his lips lifted almost imperceptibly.

Mrs. Roland.

The title had rolled off his tongue countless times in secret. Today, he could finally say it out loud.

Even if it was just an act.

The restaurant doors slid open automatically before him. Despite being peak dining hours, the place was eerily empty. Only a red-haired young man fidgeted with his phone in the corner.

"Mr. Lorenz?"

The young man jerked his head up, scrambling to his feet. "H-Hello..."

Adrian studied him calmly. Early twenties, dressed like a rebellious high schooler.

"You're Star's—"

"Husband." Adrian took his seat. "Forget the remaining payment. Just answer a few questions."

Rusty exhaled in relief. "Your secretary already briefed me."

A waiter approached with menus, but Adrian pushed them toward Rusty. "Order whatever you like."

"No, no!" Rusty waved his hands. "This place is way too expensive. Ask me anything."

Adrian requested a bottle of red wine, his gaze sharp as a blade. "The Porsche—gold?"

"Yes, exactly!"

"Nearly new, modified engine, scratches on the steering wheel."

Rusty's eyes bulged. "Spot on! Did Star secretly—"

"Keep the car." Adrian cut him off. "Who sold it to you?"

"A guy wearing a mask, around thirty, walked really fast."

Not Grant Rubenstein.

Adrian tapped the table lightly. Uncle Xavier had claimed the garage was flooded, yet the car was in perfect condition. Even stranger—the money had gone into Stella's account.

"Mr. Roland?" Rusty ventured cautiously. "You and Star—"

"Shall I open the wine?" A server wheeled a cart over.

"Open it."

The dark red liquid swirled in the decanter like blood. As the waiter arranged the glasses, he suddenly lowered his voice. "The boss asked me to remind you—your girlfriend threw quite the fit last time."

Adrian's eyes turned icy. "Your boss?"

"Yeah. Said every time you drink, that lady starts making a scene."

Rusty leaned in with a smirk. "Your girlfriend’s that fierce too?"

"She’s not fierce." Adrian set down his glass, warmth flickering in his eyes. "She just worries about my stomach."
###Chapter 309: Bittersweet Memories

The wine bottle stood untouched on the dining table.

Rusty's gaze lingered on it, his throat bobbing.

Adrian pushed the glass toward him. "Take it."

"Really? Thank you, Mr. Roland!"

Under the moonlight, Rusty cradled the bottle with a toothy grin.

"How are you getting back? Need a ride?"

"No."

Rusty scratched his head. "That car you usually drive—"

"Not necessary." Adrian cut him off. "Keep today's events to yourself."

"Don't worry! My lips are sealed!" Rusty thumped his chest before speeding off in the Porsche.

Adrian's phone lit up, the screen displaying "Uncle Xavier."

A hearty laugh came through the line.

"Well, well! Adrian Roland calling me? Must be my lucky day."

"Caught a pilot fish, I see." Adrian's lips curved slightly. "No lecture about focusing on work?"

"Fresh catch! Want to come try it?"

"Sure."

Silence. Then— "Wait, seriously?"

"Not welcoming me?"

"Nonsense! I'd have you over every day if I could." Uncle Xavier boomed. "Steamed or sashimi?"

A taxi pulled up. Adrian gave the driver the beach house address.

"Sashimi. Preserve the original flavor."

"Perfect. It'll be perfectly chilled by the time you arrive."

Ending the call, Adrian watched the city blur past the window.

This route was muscle memory.

Even the roadside kapok trees remained unchanged.

Memories surged.

School uniforms. Him pedaling a bicycle with Stella on the back.

"Not here. Too expensive." Her fingers clutched his shirt.

He'd laughed. "The Roland heir can afford it."

"No family money." She shook her head. "Let's go to the food stalls. Grilled squid's only five bucks."

Back then, he'd already started handling company matters with ample allowance.

Yet she always insisted: "When we're married, I'll manage the finances. Every penny counted."

And later?

The window rolled down. Night air rushed in.

To treat her with his own earnings, he'd secretly worked three months.

Finally able to proudly lead her into a restaurant.

During his confession, the entire place erupted in cheers.

She'd buried her flaming face in his chest, ears crimson.

Those days...

Even bitterness tasted sweet.

"Good memories, sir?" The driver glanced in the rearview mirror.

"Mm. Proposed around here."

"Did it work out?"

"We married."

"School sweethearts to wedding bells? Impressive."

Yes. Outsiders only saw the fairytale ending.

The thousand fractures beneath? Theirs alone to bear.

"The weeping crabapples are blooming now. Taking your wife to see them?"

Adrian stiffened. "Crabapples?"

"Mount Rainier's backside has an ancient tree. Flowers like pink snow—"

Crabapples!

The floral brooch!

Stella once said it held precious memories with Mr. Alistair.

"To Mount Rainier! Now!"

The driver blinked. "But the villa—"

"Crabapples first." Adrian pulled out a thick wad of bills. "I'm chartering your car."

The rustle of cash made the man's eyes gleam.

"Buckle up! That place is remote—would've missed it if I hadn't gotten lost last—"

Tires screeched as the taxi shot into the night.
###Chapter 310: Turn Your Hand Over, Let Me See

Weeping crabapple.

Adrian Roland had never seen this flower native to the northern regions before.

He hadn't even heard its name until now.

Yet the words "weeping crabapple" sent a tremor through his heart.

Could this be the same tree from his dreams, the one bursting with pink blossoms?

When the taxi stopped before a sea of flowers, he froze.

Before him stood pale pink blossoms like drifting mist, swaying gracefully in the sunlight.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" The driver rubbed his hands together proudly. "Perfect spot to bring your girlfriend."

Adrian's throat tightened as his fingers dug unconsciously into his palms.

The driver kept chattering: "Not many people know about this place yet. Once it becomes an Instagram hotspot—"

"Draw me a map." Adrian cut him off abruptly.

The driver blinked. "What?"

"A map to get here." He pulled out his wallet. "Name your price."

The driver's eyes darted before holding up five fingers.

"Five million." Adrian didn't hesitate. "On condition this location stays secret. Forever."

The driver's jaw dropped.

He'd only meant to ask for fifty thousand.

......

At the Atlante mansion, Old Man Xavier was in unusually high spirits.

Grant Rubenstein stood behind him massaging his shoulders, listening to the old man hum an opera tune.

"Grant." Xavier spoke suddenly.

"Yes, Uncle Xavier?"

"Check if the fish is ready. Adrian should be arriving soon."

Grant frowned. "This is the seventh time you've asked."

The old man narrowed his eyes. "Got a problem with that?"

"...Of course not."

Xavier snorted. "I know you've always resented him."

Grant's knuckles whitened around his cane.

"Adrian is simply better than you," Xavier stated bluntly. "My empire goes to the most capable."

Grant forced a smile. "Your empire, your rules."

"Such hypocrisy." Xavier shook his head. "Adrian's only weakness is sentimentality. You may be inferior, but at least women don't distract you."

Grant's smile stiffened. "Then why—"

"Because I only accept the best." Xavier interrupted. "Two stars cannot share one sky. That's fate."

The front door opened.

Adrian walked in with a smile. "Apologies for being late, Uncle Xavier."

The old man's face lit up. "Perfect timing. The fish is almost done."

"Then I'm in for a treat today."

He naturally took over pushing the wheelchair, guiding Xavier toward the dining room.

Xavier looked surprised. "First time you've volunteered to push me."

"I was immature before." Adrian's voice softened. "I'll visit more often."

The old man studied him suspiciously. "Changed your tune? You used to leave right after business discussions."

"Your scolding woke me up."

Xavier nodded. "Women are nothing but—"

"Trouble." Adrian finished the sentence. "I remember."

As the wheelchair stopped at the dining table, Xavier abruptly changed topics:

"That incident with Stella Valentine last time—you're sure it wasn't you who saved her?"

Adrian's smile didn't falter. "Her heart belongs to someone else. My presence wouldn't have mattered."

"Then who was it?"

"No idea." He shrugged. "Four years is long enough to find new companionship."

Xavier's gaze sharpened. "I heard the rescuer got a cut on his right hand..."

His eyes locked onto Adrian's right hand.

"Turn your hand over. Let me see."
###Chapter 311: You'll Never Outshine Him

A faint smile played on his lips. "Don't you trust me, Uncle Xavier?"

Mr. Xavier's fingers traced the armrest of his wheelchair. "I need to see it with my own eyes. If it wasn't you, there won't be any marks."

Adrian's knuckles turned white against the wheelchair handles.

"Just one look," Mr. Xavier narrowed his eyes. "Then we'll enjoy our fish dinner."

"You really insist on seeing?"

"Call it curiosity."

Slowly, Adrian released his grip. His right hand hung limp, unblemished in the dim light.

Mr. Xavier's hawk-like gaze locked onto his palm.

BOOM—

An explosion rocked the kitchen.

The entire villa trembled. Crystal chandeliers swayed violently.

Grant stumbled out on crutches. "Uncle Xavier, evacuate now!"

Chefs fled in panic. "Gas leak!"

"What happened?" Mr. Xavier barked.

Grant shoved Adrian aside, wheeling the chair toward the exit. "Flash explosion!"

"What about Adrian?"

"He can damn well run on his own!"

"His left arm—"

Gritting his teeth, Grant turned back—only to find Adrian leaning against the foyer wall.

"Waiting for me?"

"Quite the coincidence," Adrian tapped the wall lightly. "Exploding right when you needed proof."

Grant's crutch thudded against marble. "Twenty years as his loyal dog... yet you, who vanished for six, still hold his heart."

"I only repaid a debt."

"I know," Grant lowered his voice abruptly. "That night—you really did save Stella."

Adrian's eyes turned glacial.

"I could help you."

"Your price?"

"Renounce all claims to Xavier's estate."

A derisive laugh escaped Adrian. "Why should I trust you?"

"Because I know," Grant leaned closer, breath hot against his ear, "you'll never outshine a dead man."

Shards of glass glittered between them like frozen tears.

"Mr. Alistair isn't dead."

Adrian's pupils contracted.

"He's in Houston right now," Grant savored his shock. "Care to guess who Stella will choose?"

The rhythmic tap of crutches faded down the corridor.

Staring at the old scar across his palm, Adrian suddenly laughed—a hollow, broken sound.
###Chapter 312: Truth and Lies

Mr. Alistair is alive?

Adrian Roland's pupils constricted violently. The teacup in his hand nearly slipped from his grasp.

He had never considered this possibility.

That man was supposed to be... How could this be?

"Grant Rubenstein, you'd better explain yourself." Adrian's voice was icy. "This isn't something to joke about."

Grant leisurely adjusted his cuffs, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "Why so agitated, Mr. Roland? Could it be... you're afraid?"

"I have nothing to fear." Adrian forced himself to remain composed. "I just won't tolerate your nonsense."

"Nonsense?" Grant suddenly laughed. "Mr. Roland, don't tell me you actually believed you could permanently take Mr. Alistair's place?"

Adrian's knuckles turned white.

He had thought about it.

When he first heard of Mr. Alistair's death, he had even felt a secret flicker of relief.

"If he's alive, why hasn't he come to see Stella?" Adrian's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

Grant gave him a meaningful look. "You really don't remember?"

"What do you mean?"

"Nothing." Grant shrugged. "Just amusing that you'd ask such a question."

Adrian shot to his feet, the chair screeching against the floor.

"Speak plainly!"

Grant took a leisurely sip of tea. "Calm down. You'll reopen your wounds. Uncle Xavier would be upset if he saw."

Adrian inhaled sharply and forced himself back into his seat.

"What are you trying to say?"

"It's simple." Grant set down his cup. "Mr. Alistair could return at any moment. And you... should prepare yourself."

"Where is he?"

"That..." Grant's smile turned cryptic. "You'll know when you remember who you really are."

A vein throbbed at Adrian's temple.

He sensed hidden meaning in Grant's words but couldn't grasp the key.

"What are you two discussing so intensely?"

Uncle Xavier's voice suddenly came from the doorway, cutting through the tension.

"Nothing important, Uncle." Grant immediately adopted a respectful tone. "Mr. Roland was just asking about the natural gas situation."

"Oh?" Uncle Xavier wheeled himself inside. "Is it fixed?"

Adrian forced a smile. "Yes, everything's resolved."

"I knew I could count on you." Uncle Xavier nodded approvingly. "Grant, you should learn from Adrian."

Grant's smile stiffened. "Of course, Uncle. You're right."

"Come, let's finish our meal." Uncle Xavier gestured to the table. "This pilot fish was quite a challenge to catch."

Adrian mechanically picked up his chopsticks, the food tasteless in his mouth.

The revelation about Mr. Alistair's survival echoed relentlessly in his mind.

If this was true...

Did Stella know?

"Adrian?" Uncle Xavier asked with concern. "Not hungry? Does the food not suit you?"

"No, it's delicious." Adrian forced himself to take a bite of fish.

"Good." Uncle Xavier smiled warmly. "By the way, how are negotiations with Alexander going?"

"Almost finalized. Just waiting to sign the—"

Grant abruptly stood. "I'm finished."

"You've barely eaten." Uncle Xavier frowned.

"Lost my appetite." Grant said coldly before grabbing his cane and leaving the dining room.

Uncle Xavier sighed. "That boy's temper grows stranger by the day."

Adrian responded absently, his gaze following Grant's retreating figure.

He needed to uncover the truth.

No matter the cost.

Outside on the beach, Grant lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.

"Mr. Rubenstein." A servant approached quietly. "Everything went as you instructed."

"Hmm." Grant exhaled a smoke ring. "What was Adrian's reaction?"

"Shocked. He kept asking about Mr. Alistair."

Grant smirked. "Of course he was shocked. After all..."

"After all what?"

"Nothing." Grant stubbed out the cigarette. "Tell me, what expression do you think Adrian will have when he realizes he is Mr. Alistair?"

The servant gasped. "That's..."

"Even more interesting," Grant narrowed his eyes, "if he ever learns the truth about that car accident..."

The ocean wind howled, scattering his unfinished words into the night.
###Chapter 313: Deadly Chess Game

The servant smirked ominously. "You'll win this."

"Oh?"

"When two tigers fight, the hunter profits. No matter how powerful Mr. Xavier is, age has weakened him. Adrian may be young, but his methods are ruthless. If these two clash..." The servant drew a finger across his throat. "Once they've destroyed each other, the entire empire will be yours."

Grant Rubenstein swirled his glass, eyes glinting. "I tested Adrian earlier. He truly remembers nothing."

"Mr. Grant..."

"Speak."

The servant lowered his voice. "Severe illness requires strong medicine."

Grant's pupils contracted sharply as a long-buried secret surfaced.

He drained his glass in one gulp, the distorted reflection grinning back at him. "Stella Valentine... soon your 'Mr. Alistair' will return."

The villa dining room was thick with suffocating tension.

Adrian set down his chopsticks. "Uncle Xavier, I have two questions."

The old man dabbed his mouth. "Company matters?"

"First—were all my waterlogged sports cars really scrapped?"

Xavier's chopsticks hesitated mid-air. "Sent to the junkyard. Buy new ones if you miss them."

"Not a single one preserved?"

"None." Xavier frowned. "Why ask now?"

Adrian smiled faintly. "Sentimental value."

"Sentimentality is for cowards." Xavier pushed his bowl away. "Your second question?"

"About my parents' car accident." Adrian's gaze sharpened. "I suspect there's more to it."

Xavier coughed violently. "Didn't Lily Savigny confess? She's still imprisoned."

"Been too busy to follow up."

"Leave such trifles to me." Xavier waved dismissively. "Grant will handle it."

Adrian tapped the table lightly. "I have unanswered questions for her."

"What could a dying woman possibly tell you?" Xavier's voice rose before he forcibly steadied it. "Let the law punish her."

Adrian's eyes narrowed.

Two lies.

Not just lies—but eagerness to silence witnesses.

His parents' deaths were no accident.

"Uncle Xavier, when did you choose me as your successor?"

"Remember when you resolved New Frontier's financial crisis at twenty?"

That battle had first revealed his brilliance—retrieving every penny after his father's jade scam nearly bankrupted them.

"That early?"

"I observed you for three years." Xavier's gaze turned distant. "At twenty-three, I knew—no one else could inherit my empire."

Adrian's fingers clenched.

Twenty-three.

The year his parents died. The year he cut ties with Stella. The year Lily appeared.

Too convenient.

"Did you know Lily Savigny?"

"That gutter trash?"

"Then why ignore her back then, yet treat Stella like a threat now?"

Xavier slammed the table. "Because Lily couldn't sway you! Stella can!"

China rattled violently.

"In other words, you'd choose business over Lily. But with Stella..." Xavier sneered. "I can't take that gamble."

Adrian calmly retrieved fallen chopsticks, wiping them clean. "So anyone but Stella is acceptable?"

"Correct."

"What if I could have both Stella and the empire?"

Xavier erupted. "Have you lost your mind?! Abandon everything for a woman who loves another man?!"

Adrian placed the polished chopsticks before him. "Just a hypothetical. Don't upset yourself."

"Then what are your true feelings for Stella now?" Xavier's stare burned. "An act... or have you fallen for her again?"
###Chapter 314: Stella, Look at Me

"Uncle Xavier, in all of Houston, who else besides you and me could make two scrapped cars vanish without a trace?"

Mr. Xavier's fingers tightened around his prayer beads, knuckles turning white. "You suspect me?"

"I'm merely stating facts." Adrian picked up a stalk of celery with his chopsticks, chewed twice, then spat it back into the bowl. "Finding those cars sooner would've revealed the tampered brakes."

"And then what?" Mr. Xavier sneered. "Patch things up with Stella Valentine?"

"At least those years wouldn't have been wasted."

"Without those years, would you be where you are today?" Mr. Xavier slammed the table. "Grant!"

Grant Rubenstein approached swiftly with his cane, exchanging a brief glare with Adrian.

"Take me to my room!"

The dining room fell silent.

A servant ventured timidly, "Mr. Roland, it's about to rain. Would you like to stay the night?"

"Thunder?"

"A few distant rumbles just now..."

"I need to go back."

The lights were still on in the second-floor master bedroom.

Pushing the door open, he found Stella curled in the corner of the sofa, drowning in his white dress shirt like a drowsy kitten.

She was twenty-nine now.

They'd known each other for twenty years.

Yet she still looked so small. So fragile.

A woman who should've been cherished had endured cancer, betrayal, and the loss of a child.

How had she survived those stormy nights alone?

Now she stayed here playing this charade—for his grandfather's sake.

"Mmm..." Rubbing her eyes, she sat up. "You're back. Let me heat the dessert soup..."

He pressed a hand to her shoulder.

"Already ate." His gaze lingered on her sleep-softened features. "Why wait up?"

"Because..."

"Stella." His voice tightened. "Look at me. Really look."

Her lashes fluttered, clarity returning to her eyes. "Adrian Roland."

"Not Mr. Alistair?"

"I know the difference."

His lips twisted wryly. "Go to bed."

She remained, fingers twisting together.

"Something to say?"

"Thank you." The words barely carried. "For getting Victor Lefèvre's donation agreement."

So that was it.

His mouth curved without humor. "So tonight's dessert was payment?"
###Chapter 315: I Long to Be Him

"...You could say that."

"Stella, Hugo once told me something. We don't say 'thank you' to those closest to us. Only strangers get formalities."

Stella bit her lip and sighed softly. "I..."

"No need to explain." Adrian cut her off. "I understand. Get some rest."

She didn't move. "Mr. Alistair is alive."

Adrian's head snapped up.

"I saw his driver at the Houston Grand Hotel." Her voice trembled. "He confirmed it himself."

"And then?"

"But he didn't come to me." Stella's nose turned pink. "He must hate me now. There's no going back, but I still love him. If he's happy, I'll let go. Those memories will last me a lifetime."

Adrian nodded. "I respect your choice. After the contract is signed and Grandfather passes, you're free to go wherever you wish."

Stella exhaled in relief. "...Thank you."

"That's the second 'thank you.'" He gave a bitter smile. "We've really grown apart."

"In the end, everyone walks their path alone." She gazed out the window. "Parents leave. Children leave. Even the ones we love most leave. Distance makes the parting easier to bear."

He sighed deeply. "Go to sleep."

"One more thing." Stella suddenly remembered. "Grandfather's eightieth birthday is coming up. Tradition demands a grand celebration."

"I'll handle it."

......

"Doctor, I saw that crabapple tree. Exactly like in my dreams."

"How did it feel?"

"Like my heart had been hollowed out, letting cold wind rush in." He pressed a hand to his chest. "Yet also... joyful. Like holding the world's most precious treasure."

Dr. Klein made a note. "Any other dreams?"

"Not for now."

"But MV Agusta feels strangely familiar."

"A person's name?"

"A motorcycle brand." Adrian's eyes grew distant. "Little Star loved it because of its connection to Mr. Alistair. Doctor, I'm becoming more like him every day."

"Is that what you want?"

"I dream of nothing else." His voice shook. "Sometimes I imagine waking up as him. Little Star would cry in my arms, asking where I'd been."

"Has your wish come true?"

"Not yet." His fists clenched. "I'll keep trying."

Dr. Klein sighed. "As long as it makes you happy."

......

"Stella, don't leave me."
"I'll always be here when you need me."
"Leave the company to me when you're abroad. Just enjoy life."
"We'll bring Marshmallow over and renew our vows in a church."
"Stella..."

"Mommy! Wake up!"

Stella opened tear-filled eyes and pulled her daughter close.

"Are you missing Daddy?" Little Luna wiped her tears with tiny hands.

"Yes."

"I'll call Daddy!"

"...Not that Daddy."

"The Daddy in the stars?" Luna's eyes sparkled. "When I grow up, I'll be an astronaut and tell him you miss him!"

Stella laughed through her tears, kissing her daughter's cheek.

"Get up, Mommy! We have to pick up Celeste!"

Stella checked the clock. Today she'd fetch Celeste returning from abroad—Hugo had arranged for a flight attendant to accompany her.

She took a deep breath. Celeste would be cured now. She had to stay strong.

"Go eat breakfast. I'll be right down."

Grandfather Roland's laughter floated up from downstairs. Ethan always knew how to cheer him. Thinking of her children, Stella felt life had been worth living.

As she finished getting ready, her phone rang.

"Dr. Melford?"

"Am I interrupting? I'm on my way to pick you up for our weekend lunch reservation."

Stella froze. She'd completely forgotten.

"I'm so sorry, something came up today..."

Dr. Melford gave a wry chuckle. "That's rather unconvincing, Ms. Valentine."
###Chapter 316: Did You Get Back Together with Mr. Roland?

Stella Valentine froze momentarily, realizing how dismissive her earlier words must have sounded.

"It's not what you think, Dr. Melford," she explained softly. "I genuinely have something urgent."

"Something important?"

"Yes."

"Where are you headed?"

"The airport. I need to pick someone up."

Dr. Charles Melford's lips curved into an understanding smile. "What a coincidence. That private restaurant I mentioned is near the airport. How about joining me for dinner after you collect your guest?"

Before Stella could decline, he added, "Even if you won't give me a chance to pursue you, at least let me take you out for a farewell meal. Closure matters."

"You've misunderstood—"

His eyebrow arched. "Is it... your man you're picking up?"

"No!" Her hands flew up in protest. "It's a little girl."

"Your daughter?"

"...Yes."

"Perfect. I did my residency in pediatrics."

"Dr. Melford—"

"We could discuss the liver transplant procedure during the drive."

That gave Stella pause.

Celeste was returning specifically for surgery. Medical knowledge wasn't her forte—any additional insight would be valuable.

"Alright."

"Where shall I pick you up?"

"No need. Let's meet at the Oceanview Boulevard intersection."

A quiet chuckle. "Still keeping me at arm's length."

She exhaled slowly.

Living at the Roland family estate complicated things. If Old Mr. Roland or Benjamin spotted an unfamiliar man collecting her, the explanations would be exhausting.

Though clearly disappointed, the physician remained gracious. "Understood. Fifteen minutes."

As she ended the call and turned toward the door, Benjamin appeared holding a bowl of steamed egg custard.

"Going out, Miss Stella?"

"To the airport."

The elderly butler frowned. "Best not take the children. Luna coughed all night, and airports are crowded."

Stella agreed. Medical discussions would frighten the little ones.

Kneeling, she cupped her daughter's round face. "Stay home with Ethan today, sweetheart?"

Luna's large eyes crinkled into crescent moons. "Can you bring back egg waffles?"

"Of course."

The girl immediately grasped Benjamin's hand. "I'll wait for Celeste."

"What an understanding child," the butler remarked warmly.

Stella's heart melted. Her daughter was so easily pleased.

But Benjamin had a point. Gentle-natured Luna shouldn't risk the airport crowds.

"Once your cough's better, we'll visit the amusement park."

"Yay~"

Rising, Stella nodded to the butler. "Thank you for watching them."

He waved dismissively. "I'd be delighted if you had more children for me to care for! That pear soup—"

Pear soup!

Heat flooded Stella's ears as she bolted for the door. "I'm leaving now!"

Benjamin's laughter followed her. "Still as shy as when you were little."

"Why is Mommy shy?" Luna's curious voice carried.

"Because she's thinking about your father."

"Does thinking about someone you like make you shy?"

"Exactly!"

Stella half-ran until the estate disappeared from view.

That night with the pear soup...

Thankfully, nothing had happened.

But Adrian had clawed at his scars, endured ice-cold showers, even collapsed—all to resist the aphrodisiac's effects.

Her phone chimed.

"Miss Valentine? I've arrived."

Snapping back to the present, she hailed a cab. "Five minutes!"

Oceanview Boulevard was nearly deserted. The black Lexus stood out immediately.

That make... Mr. Alistair used to drive one too.

Understated. Unlike Adrian's garage full of Porsches.

"Miss Valentine." Dr. Melford's eyes brightened. "You look lovely today."

Her minimal makeup, pink plaid shirt, and jeans gave her a collegiate air.

"Just picking someone up. No need for formality."

His mouth twisted wryly. "I wore a suit specially."

She averted her gaze.

"Never mind. This was always about the surgery." His tone turned self-deprecating. "You didn't join that matchmaking show to find romance, did you?"

A pause.

"Because... you've reconciled with Mr. Roland?"
###Chapter 317: That Temper is the Spitting Image of Mr. Roland

"No." Stella Valentine's denial was firm.

Dr. Charles chuckled. "Since you're not back together, that means you're still single. So I still have a chance."

"I'm not considering any romantic relationships right now." Stella met his gaze directly. "My focus is on running the company and taking care of my family."

Dr. Charles didn't press further. He opened the car door for her, shielding the top with his hand. "Let's go pick up your daughter from the airport first."

Stella remained rooted in place.

"What's wrong?"

She walked straight to the back seat, her voice calm. "The front passenger seat is for the lady of the house. It wouldn't be appropriate for me to sit there."

"So formal?"

"It's better to be clear from the start."

Dr. Charles shook his head helplessly and gently closed the door.

The car glided smoothly along the road.

Stella watched the scenery flash by outside the window, suddenly remembering how Mr. Alistair drove. He was always steady behind the wheel, but on a motorcycle, he became a completely different person—like that terrifying ride up Mount Rainier that nearly gave her a heart attack.

"Something amusing?" Dr. Charles glanced at her through the rearview mirror.

Stella quickly schooled her expression. "Nothing."

"Did you find a liver donor?"

"Yes. A matching donor was located."

"That fast?"

"Luck, and some help from a friend."

At the airport arrivals hall, little Celeste sat atop her suitcase as a flight attendant wheeled her out.

"Mommy!" The little girl waved excitedly.

Stella hurried forward and scooped her up. "Were you scared flying alone?"

"The pretty lady kept me company!"

After thanking the flight attendant, Celeste eyed Dr. Charles warily. "Mommy, who's this uncle?"

"This is Dr. Charles. He's a very skilled doctor."

"Is he going to be my new daddy?" Celeste asked bluntly.

Stella's ears burned. "Don't say silly things. He's just a friend."

"My teacher says mommies and daddies belong together." Celeste tightened her arms around Stella's neck.

At three years old, Celeste was smaller and frailer than most children her age. The bluish veins beneath her pale skin stood out starkly.

"Is this your youngest?" Dr. Charles asked.

"Yes. Her name is Celeste."

"A poetic name."

"Uncle, don't waste your time. Mommy won't like you." Celeste lifted her chin. "I look like Daddy, and I act like Daddy too!"

Dr. Charles laughed. "That stubborn temper is exactly like Mr. Roland."

Stella quickly intervened. "She must be hungry. Let's get some food."

A private restaurant was nearby.

Celeste fell asleep in her arms. As they entered, Stella nearly tripped over the threshold.

"Careful!" Dr. Charles steadied her just in time.

"Thanks, I wasn't paying attention—"

...

Not far away, a camera shutter clicked softly.

"Finally caught this guy. Driving a beat-up Lexus—just some broke doctor."

"His profile does kinda look like Adrian Roland."

"Stella's into this type? Trading down from the premium model?"

"Maybe... he's fast?"

The two men snickered.

"At least we can report back to Mr. Rubenstein. This doctor had the nerve to hit him twice—he's dead meat."

"Wait, we didn't get a shot of his left hand! If there's no knife scar, he's not the helmet guy!"

"Shit. We already sent the photos to Mr. Rubenstein."

A WeChat notification pinged.

Mr. Rubenstein's raspy voice came through the speaker:

"Doesn't matter. I've got other ways to confirm. Just do as I said..."
###Chapter 318: May I Ask You One Last Question?

Morning light filtered through the private dining room's glass windows. Stella Valentine carried Celeste into the booth where Dr. Charles Melford had been waiting.

"The matsutake chicken here is quite famous," Dr. Melford said, opening the menu. "Shall we try it?"

Stella gently patted the drowsy child in her arms. "Something simple will do."

"I remember you used to love seafood."

"That was a long time ago." She met his gaze. "Dr. Melford, I wanted to ask about liver transplants."

He set down the menu. "Rejection is the primary risk. The donor's lifestyle matters—do they drink regularly?"

"Occasionally."

"Smoking?"

Stella's fingers stilled. "...Yes."

The booth door swung open as a server entered with tea utensils. Celeste stirred in Stella's arms.

"What tea would you like, sir and madam?"

"She's my mommy!" Celeste blinked awake. "Daddy's in a meeting at his company!"

The server retreated awkwardly. Stella sighed and squeezed her daughter's small hand.

"Mommy." Celeste looked up. "Daddy promised to take us to the aquarium today."

Stella hesitated. "He's very busy—"

"He promised!" Celeste pressed her lips stubbornly. "Daddy never lies."

Dr. Melford studied them. "Miss Valentine, what exactly is your relationship now?"

Celeste answered instantly, "Mommy and daddy live together! They'll give me a baby brother too!"

"Celeste!" Stella's ears burned as she lifted the child. "We should go."

As she stood, Celeste's foot knocked a butter knife from the table. Steel flashed—Dr. Melford caught the blade bare-handed.

Blood dripped between his fingers.

"Call an ambulance!" Stella signaled the server urgently.

Dr. Melford pressed a napkin to his palm. "It's nothing." His gaze held hers. "I'll contact you later."

Watching him leave, Stella looked down at Celeste. The girl's eyes brimmed. "Mommy, I didn't mean to..."

"You'll apologize to Dr. Melford tonight."

"Okay." Celeste buried her face in Stella's neck. "Can we see Daddy now?"

Outside, two shadowy figures pressed against a car window. "Left hand injury—it's him!"

His companion raised a phone. "Target confirmed. Move in."
###Chapter 319: Come With Me

Dr. Charles gripped the steering wheel with one hand, veins bulging on his right. Blood still seeped from the wound on his left palm, staining the leather wrap.

He irritably tapped his Bluetooth earpiece and dialed a number.

"Speak." A hoarse yet authoritative voice came through.

Dr. Charles's eyes darkened instantly. "She insists she hasn't reconciled with Adrian."

"Hah. That woman..." The old man sneered. "She promised to leave Adrian forever if we found a liver donor. Now she's going back on her word!"

"But her tone didn't sound like she was lying."

"Not now doesn't mean never!" The voice sharpened. "You must keep getting closer to her. If she sees Adrian as Mr. Alistair's substitute, then we'll give her someone who resembles him even more!"

Dr. Charles frowned. "Do I... really resemble Mr. Alistair more than Adrian does?"

"Your face is less similar, but you must master his demeanor and speech. When Stella fell for him, she hadn't even seen his face. What does that tell you? She loves the soul!"

"But she shows no interest in me..."

"Then you're not convincing enough!" The old man snapped. "Use any means necessary to make her leave Adrian!"

A ruthless glint flashed in Dr. Charles's eyes. "Understood."

"What happened to your hand?"

"Cut by a knife. The left one."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"...What a coincidence."

"What?"

"Nothing. Remember your mission."

Stella hugged Celeste tightly as the cold wind made her shiver. The remote location meant no taxis arrived even after ten minutes of waiting.

"Miss Valentine?"

Two rough-looking men suddenly blocked her path. Stella instinctively stepped back, shielding her daughter.

"Too important to remember us?" The taller one grinned. "At Mr. Rubenstein's place, we saw that heroic rescue firsthand."

William Rubenstein's men! Stella's chest tightened. "You've been following me?"

"Mr. Rubenstein said," the shorter one rubbed his hands, "either call your little lover here, or... spend the night with him." His lecherous gaze slid to Celeste. "Let the kid learn something too—"

"Shut up!" Stella snapped, pushing Celeste behind her.

The tall man suddenly lunged for Celeste. Stella twisted away, but the shorter one seized her wrist.

"Mommy!" Celeste cried, pounding the man's arm.

"You little brat!" The man raised his hand to strike.

Stella whirled around, shielding her daughter with her back.

The expected blow never came.

A dark figure flashed past. The man screamed as he was sent flying.

A matte gray helmet gleamed coldly under the sun. The black-clad rider scooped up both mother and child, settling them securely on his motorcycle.

"Knew you'd show!" The men pulled out knives with vicious smirks.

Adrian dodged the first blade, but the second grazed his neck, leaving a thin trail of blood.

Without hesitation, he revved the engine. The motorcycle shot forward like an arrow, vanishing around the corner in seconds.

###Chapter 320 You can call me Dad

The wind howled across the mountain peak as Stella Valentine tightened her grip around Celeste. She shut her eyes, feeling the weightlessness from the motorcycle's breakneck speed along the winding mountain road.

"Where exactly are we going?" Her voice fractured against the rushing wind.

"Mount Rainier." Adrian Roland's muffled reply came from inside his helmet. "Only place without surveillance."

Stella opened her eyes to increasingly familiar scenery. The motorcycle hurtled at terrifying speeds along the steep cliffs, each sharp turn making her heart pound.

"Slow down!" she shouted.

Adrian ignored her, twisting the throttle harder. Stella could only clutch Celeste tighter, praying they'd survive.

When the bike finally stopped, Stella's legs trembled. She jumped off holding Celeste, squinting against the blinding sunlight.

Celeste suddenly wriggled free and marched toward Adrian.

He removed his helmet, locking eyes with the unfamiliar girl. Her fox-like gaze held none of Luna's sweetness.

"So you're Celeste?"

The child tilted her head, then shook it firmly. "You're not my daddy."

Adrian arched a brow at Stella, who rushed over to take her daughter's hand. "He's Ethan and Luna's father."

"Then where's my daddy?" Celeste's question silenced Stella.

"You can call me Dad," Adrian offered.

"No." Celeste's stubborn shake sent her curls bouncing. "You're not."

"Quite the attitude," Adrian remarked dryly.

"She's unwell." Stella protectively pulled Celeste behind her, noticing the wound on his neck. "Does it hurt?"

"Compared to my arm? Nothing." He wiped away blood carelessly. "Why did you meet that Dr. Melford today?"

Stella's gaze darted away. "For Celeste's treatment."

"Really?" Adrian stepped closer. "Then why won't you look at me?"

Her head snapped up, eyes blazing. "Happy now? Should I repeat myself?"

Tension crackled between them.

"I just find him suspicious," Adrian retreated slightly. "Does he resemble Mr. Alistair?"

"This has nothing to do with him!" Stella's voice rose. "What's between us is completely different."

"I know." His laugh held self-mockery. "I'm not worthy of comparison."

Stella turned away as mountain winds tangled her hair.

"William's men are watching you," she changed subjects. "How will you explain that neck wound?"

Adrian scoffed. "You think I fear him?"

"But what if he threatens the children?" His sudden counter froze her. "If he uses Ethan, Luna or Celeste against you—what then?"

Stella's face drained of color.

"That's why I must stay hidden." His voice turned gravelly. "Once they know your weakness, you and the kids will never be safe."

She bit her lip. "But Grandfather's birthday is this weekend. That injury..."

"Here, mister." Celeste suddenly produced a bandage from her bag. "Put this on."

Adrian stared at the unpredictable child. "Why give it to me?"

"Because you like Mommy." Celeste blinked mischievously. "Anyone who likes Mommy is good."

Chuckling, Adrian applied the bandage using the rearview mirror.

Stella pinched her daughter's cheek. "Don't talk nonsense."

"I'm not." Celeste jutted her chin. "That Dr. Melford looks at Mommy differently."

Wind sent autumn leaves spiraling around them. Three elongated shadows stretched across the mountain peak in the setting sun.
###Chapter 321: The Truth in Contrast

"Mommy, this uncle is different from that uncle!" Celeste tugged at my sleeve, her eyes sparkling.

I crouched down and gently pinched her cheek. "How are they different?"

"This uncle looks at you like stars. That uncle looks at you like ice."

I couldn't help but laugh. Children's words were always so blunt yet accurate.

Adrian stood nearby, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly. The black MV Agusta Brutale he rode today gleamed coldly under the sunlight, accentuating his sharp demeanor.

"When did you learn to ride a motorcycle?" I asked casually.

His slender fingers brushed the handlebars. "First time, but it feels familiar."

My heart skipped a beat. Could the connection between twins really be this strong? Did that mean he could sense every moment I'd shared with Mr. Alistair?

The ringing of my phone interrupted my thoughts.

"It's Dr. Melford," I told Celeste.

Dr. Melford's voice remained warm on the other end. "Miss Valentine, I've compiled some liver transplant care notes. Should I bring them over tomorrow?"

"No need to trouble yourself. Just email them."

"These are handwritten notes I've accumulated over the years. I'll be passing by anyway."

After hanging up, I noticed Celeste staring at me with a serious expression.

"Mommy, I don't want you to see that uncle," she pouted.

"Why not?"

She twisted her fingers. "Because...Mommy belongs to Daddy!"

My heart ached sharply. Over the years, Celeste's longing for her father had become increasingly evident.

I dialed Harry's number, only to hear the cold tone of a blocked call.

"You've been blocked," Adrian remarked calmly.

Celeste looked up at him. "Uncle, do you know my daddy?"

"I do."

"Do I look like him?"

Adrian paused. "Girls usually resemble their mothers."

"Liar!" Celeste puffed her cheeks. "Luna looks like Mommy, but I don't."

"You will when you're older." He crouched to meet her gaze. "So eat well and focus on getting better."

Celeste's eyes lit up. "When I'm healthy, I want to go to the amusement park with Mommy and Daddy! And take a family photo!"

Adrian and I exchanged a glance, both seeing the same pain reflected in each other's eyes.

"Oh, Uncle," Celeste tilted her head suddenly, "what's your name?"

"Adrian Roland."

Celeste froze, then turned to me in confusion. "Mommy...isn't that Daddy's name?"

The air turned to ice.
###Chapter 322: You Know What I'm Thankful For

Celeste's words exploded in the hospital room like a bomb.

Adrian whipped his head toward Stella. Her lashes trembled, lips quivering as if she wanted to speak but swallowed the words.

"Stella, you..."

"What?"

His Adam's apple bobbed, voice tight. "You told our daughter... I'm her father?"

Stella clenched the hem of her shirt. "It's not what you think..."

His eyes ignited like stars.

Was it to make Celeste feel less different?

Or to prevent Ethan and Luna from rejecting their sister?

He chuckled softly. "Whatever the reason, I accept it."

Stella's throat constricted. The truth was too complicated—she couldn't disrupt Mr. Alistair's life. If Adrian learned he had a twin brother, he'd tear the world apart searching.

Mr. Alistair chose to leave, returning to the shadows. All these years, he could've reunited with his family but never did.

He said he was lonely.

That he only wanted her.

But now...

Stella smiled bitterly. He didn't even want her anymore.

She'd keep this secret.

"It was just for the children..."

"I understand." Overjoyed, Adrian ignored his neck injury and reached for Celeste. "I'm your daddy."

Celeste froze, tugging Stella's sleeve uncertainly. "Mommy, is his name really Adrian Roland?"

"...Yes."

Adrian softened his voice. "Ask your siblings if you don't believe me. Or look up my photos online."

Celeste bit her lip. "But..."

"What else?"

He searched his name on his phone. A finance magazine cover appeared instantly.

He handed it to her. "See?"

Celeste scrutinized it, then shook her head. "No... I know how to write Daddy's name. It's not this."

Adrian raised a brow. "Show me."

He opened the handwriting input.

Her chubby finger traced the characters: "A-d-r-i-a-n R-o-l-a-n-d. The last character is different."

Adrian explained, "Did Mommy teach you this?"

"Mm-hmm."

"'Roland' is too hard for you, so she taught you an easier version. But it's pronounced the same."

Celeste looked at Stella hopefully. "Mommy, is it true? Is he really my daddy?"

Her daughter's innocent gaze pierced Stella's heart.

Adrian stroked Celeste's hair. "When you're older, Mommy will teach you the correct spelling. Try searching 'Adrian Roland'?"

Celeste took a deep breath and typed it in.

No results.

Only the prompt: [Did you mean "Adrian Roland"?]

"See? That person doesn't exist."

Tears welled in Celeste's eyes as she clutched her shirt. "Why did Mommy lie to me..."

Stella knelt to embrace her. "Mommy was wrong."

"Mommy..." Celeste suddenly wailed, "I have a daddy now! I finally have a daddy!"

Her cries shattered the room. Adrian pulled them both into his arms.

"Daddy."

"Yes?"

"Can you and Mommy make up?"

"Of course." His voice cracked. "Our family will stay together forever."

Celeste sobbed uncontrollably. Adrian lifted her while Stella wiped tears. "Sweetheart, Daddy's hurt. Let Mommy hold you."

"It's fine." He patted Celeste's back. "Let me hold her longer."

"...Thank you."

Adrian glanced at her. "For what?"

Stella pressed her lips together. "You know."

He did.

"I should thank you—for telling Celeste her father is Adrian Roland."

"..."

"The wrong character doesn't matter. It is difficult to write."

"What about Grandpa?"

Adrian shrugged. "We'll say Celeste is ours. He'll be thrilled."

"We already lied to him once..."

"White lies don't count."
###Chapter 323: A Fateful Coincidence

They began their descent as dusk settled over the mountains.

Adrian Roland shifted his motorcycle into the lowest gear. "The surveillance will be down tonight. Let's take a detour before heading back."

"Mm."

The journey down was slower and steadier than their ascent.

The motorcycle's backseat was cramped with three people, little Celeste wedged awkwardly in the middle.

"Mommy."

"Yes, sweetheart?"

"Daddy is so handsome."

Stella Valentine's ears tinged pink. She murmured a soft agreement.

Celeste giggled. "Is that why you fell in love with him?"

The question caught Stella off guard. "Why do you ask?"

"I want to know more about you two!"

"...Ask your father."

Adrian chuckled. "Your mother was the campus belle back then. Suitors lined up all the way to the school gates."

"But Mommy chose you!" Celeste gave a thumbs-up. "Daddy's the best!"

The innocent praise warmed Adrian's heart.

His gaze softened. "Winning her over wasn't easy. She was quite the challenge."

"That's not true! Mommy's always gentle."

"Now she is. Back then, she strutted around like a proud little peacock. Adorable."

Stella swatted his shoulder in mock outrage. "Don't fill her head with nonsense."

"I'm serious." Adrian's voice suddenly dropped. "Remember your twentieth birthday wishlist? I nearly ran myself ragged fulfilling those."

Stella's head snapped up. "How did you know about that? Those were private diary entries."

Adrian froze.

"You read my diary?"

"No..." He hesitated. "Lily Savigny had it."

The name hung like ice between them.

"She found it while staying in your room. I took it from her when I saw it."

"Where is it now?"

"Locked in my study's most secure cabinet."

Stella's pulse quickened. "Who else has seen it besides you and Lily?"

"Likely no one. Why?"

Her mind raced to Mr. Alistair's actions—getting her a dog, planting sunflowers, riding the Ferris wheel under stars—each perfectly matching her list.

If the diary hadn't been shared, how could he have known?

"Absolutely certain?"

Adrian considered. "Lily might have shown Sophia Durand, who may have told Victor Lefèvre. But—" He stopped abruptly. "Stella, what are you thinking?"

She shook her head, thoughts in turmoil.

Mr. Alistair had no connection to Victor's circle. Unless...

Twin intuition?

The possibility stole her breath.

Warm light welcomed them as they approached the ancestral home.

Grandfather Edward and the children were already asleep. Stella carried Celeste upstairs quietly.

"Mommy," Celeste whispered, eyes shining. "Is this Daddy's house?"

"Yes. Great-grandfather and Uncle Benjamin live here. They're wonderful people."

"Can we stay forever?"

"Of course."

"What about Grandma?"

"She's visiting friends." Stella kissed her forehead. "After Great-grandfather's birthday celebration, we'll go to the hospital. Once you're better, you can do anything you want."

Celeste cheered and hugged her. "I want to stay with you and Daddy always!"

"Good. Now let's get you washed up for bed."

"I can sleep alone!" The little girl puffed her chest. "I'm three and a half now!"

Stella laughed. "Our Celeste is growing up."

"And," the child added with a mischievous twinkle, "Daddy should sleep with Mommy! No more separating!"
###Chapter 324: Will You Bathe Me?

"No! No!"

Little Celeste squirmed in Stella's arms like a wriggling fish. The sudden movement made Stella's arms sag under the weight.

A warm, large hand steadied her waist just in time.

"Daddy!" Celeste cheered, launching herself at Adrian with a sunflower-bright smile.

Adrian caught his daughter effortlessly with one arm, the corner of his mouth lifting. "Good girl."

His gaze lingered on Stella's face, noting the faint shadows beneath her eyes. Between caring for their sick daughter, managing Shi's Jewelry, and dealing with Mr. Atlante's medicinal pear soups, she was clearly exhausted.

"I'll put Celeste to bed," he murmured. "You go shower first."

Stella blinked. "You?"

"Mhm."

"You know how to put a child to sleep?"

Adrian arched an eyebrow. "I raised Luna when she was a baby."

"But Celeste is three. Toddlers are the most difficult."

"I've handled five-year-olds. Three is nothing."

The moment the words left his mouth, both froze.

Stella studied him skeptically. "When did you take care of a five-year-old?"

Adrian himself seemed puzzled. Other than infant Luna, he'd never cared for another child. Ethan had been five four years ago, but back then...

"Slip of the tongue," he cleared his throat.

Stella pressed her lips together. "Lily's child would be about three now, wouldn't they?"

Adrian's eyes turned glacial. He leaned in until his breath brushed her ear. "Do you really think I'd take care of her child?"

"I just—"

"You're doubting me." His low voice held unwavering certainty as he met her gaze. "Stella, there's nothing between Lily and me but hatred. She killed my parents and tried using pregnancy to evade justice. As for whose child she carried—that's irrelevant to me."

His cadence grew more reminiscent of Mr. Alistair—gentle yet unyielding.

Stella lifted her eyes, starlight shimmering in their depths.

"During the trial, she said—"

"IVF requires my cooperation," Adrian chuckled darkly. "I've never participated in such procedures."

His fingertips grazed her cheek. "From the day we reunited, I vowed never to lie to you again."

Stella's gaze dropped to the wound on his neck, her brow furrowing. "Bathing is hard enough with your hand injured. Now your neck too."

As Adrian reached to touch it, she seized his wrist.

"Don't!" she chided urgently. "Remember in high school when you got hurt playing soccer? It was almost healed until Lucas touched it and caused an infection."

The shared memory hung between them like mist.

"Fine, I won't touch it," he conceded softly.

"Then how will you bathe?"

"I won't."

Stella wrinkled her nose in distaste. "After fighting and speeding today? You reek of sweat."

Adrian suddenly grinned, leaning closer to whisper, "How about... you bathe me instead?"

The tips of her ears burned crimson.

Before she could react, his lips brushed hers feather-light. He ruffled her hair just like years ago. "Just teasing. I'll manage."

Stella stood rooted, fingertips unconsciously touching where he'd kissed. The spot still tingled with residual warmth.

His voice carried from the bathroom. "Stella?"

"Yes?"

"Are you still there?" Caution laced his tone. "I was afraid you'd gotten angry... and hidden from me again."
###Chapter 325: Tailor-Made

Dawn light filtered through the curtains as Stella Valentine awoke from her dreams.

The space beside her was empty, leaving only a faint trace of sandalwood cologne. Her fingers brushed over the cold sheets before curling slightly.

A gift box at the foot of the bed gleamed softly in the morning light. The embossed card bore familiar handwriting: "Wear this today."

A lavender floral sundress cascaded like water, paired with silver stilettoes adorned with diamond dust. A platinum jewelry set rested in a velvet case, its gems scattering prismatic sparks under the sunlight.

But what surprised her most was the matching hair ribbon.

She wove it into her raven-black tresses, tying it into a bow at the back. The remaining ends trailed over her shoulders, swaying with each breeze.

"Oh my God!" Joy Fairsprene's gasp echoed at the villa's entrance. "Stella, you look absolutely divine today!"

Julian Valois adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, admiration flashing in his eyes. "That ensemble suits you exceptionally well, Ms. Valentine."

"Right?" Joy hooked her arm through Stella's. "This outfit was made for you!"

Stella glanced down at the dress. "It's the new Chanel collection."

"Yet you make it look one-of-a-kind!" Joy suddenly lowered her voice. "Seriously, did Adrian pick this out?"

Julian chuckled. "Who else could match Ms. Valentine's preferences so perfectly?"

Joy pouted. "Not necessarily. Mr. Alistair also—"

Stella gave her hand a gentle squeeze.

The air stilled.

Julian studied Stella with quiet intensity. "Do you believe in fate, Ms. Valentine? That every encounter is predestined?"

"What do you mean by that?"

"Some truths reveal themselves when the time is right."

Joy rolled her eyes. "I hate cryptic talk!"

Julian sighed. "Certain discoveries hold more meaning when made independently."

Stella tightened her grip on the clutch. "May I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"Is Mr. Alistair..." Her voice barely carried. "Is he doing alright?"

Julian's gaze flickered behind his lenses. "He wasn't in good spirits when we last met."

"And now?"

"Ms. Valentine," Julian exhaled, "he never stopped loving you. His absence has reasons."

Joy cut in sharply. "Enough! You're just covering for Adrian! Stella, don't listen—"

"Relationships are private matters," Julian interjected.

"Not this time!" Joy shielded Stella. "I'm vetting everything now!"

"Joy..." Stella began, only for old Mr. Roland's laughter to ring out behind them.

"This girl's got fire!" The patriarch leaned on Benjamin Langley's arm, eyes twinkling. "Julian, you've got your hands full!"

Julian stepped forward to assist him, wry. "Perhaps I owed her in a past life."

Mr. Roland patted his hand. "Youth should be lively. Speaking of—where's that grandson of mine?"

Benjamin gestured toward the entrance. "The young master has arrived."

Sunlight framed a tall, broad-shouldered silhouette in the doorway. Adrian Roland stood haloed in gold, his gaze piercing through the crowd—anchoring solely on Stella.
###Chapter 326: People Change

He appeared in a tailored black suit that accentuated his tall, lean frame. Even his dress shirt was the deep black of midnight.

His slender fingers held a lavender checkered tie as he strode directly toward Stella Valentine.

"Help me with this."

When Stella took the tie, she felt every eye in the banquet hall turn toward them. Joy Fairsprene's eyes widened comically, her mouth forming a perfect 'O'.

Julian Valois clamped a hand over Joy's mouth and unceremoniously hauled her away over his shoulder. Stella stared after them, stunned. When had the gentle, refined Julian become so domineering?

"People change." Adrian Roland's voice murmured by her ear.

He leaned down, pressing the tie into her palm. "Tie it high. Cover the bandage."

Understanding dawned. She rose onto her toes, deft fingers looping the silk around his neck. The scar near his Adam's apple peeked through no matter how she adjusted the fabric.

"Would you prefer a bowtie?"

"You know I hate those." His gaze burned into her.

Stella pressed her lips together. True—he'd always said bowties made him look like a waiter. That's why she only ever gifted him ties for birthdays.

"William Rubenstein is here," she whispered. "What if he notices?"

Adrian chuckled. "He won't get past security."

From across the room, Edward Roland's booming voice carried: "Isn't my grandson's wife stunning? Adrian won her heart at sixteen!"

"More grandchildren?" Stella's fingers faltered.

Adrian's eyes dropped to her flat stomach. "How much did Ethan weigh at birth?"

"Four pounds, three ounces." Her voice softened. "Luna was smaller—just four pounds."

He suddenly gripped her hand. "Did it hurt?"

Stella blinked. "The children were considerate. They didn't make me suffer much."

Tucking her hand into the crook of his arm, he said, "Never again."

The banquet hall buzzed with activity. With each guest who approached to offer birthday wishes, Adrian murmured in her ear.

"Mr. Zhu—jade connoisseur. Ask his opinion."

"That guy with the pompadour," he sneered, "stay away."

Stella glanced up in confusion.

"Look at his eye circles." Adrian's tone turned sardonic. "Surely you know what those dark circles mean on a man?"
###Chapter 327: Can We Really Never Go Back?

"Mr. Roland, long time no see!"

A grating voice interrupted them.

Stella Valentine looked up to see a man with an exaggerated pompadour approaching. He swayed slightly as he walked, clutching a garishly colored cocktail.

His face reminded her of a squashed horse—pale skin stretched over sharp cheekbones, dark circles under bloodshot eyes. The ill-fitting suit hung on his gaunt frame like a walking skeleton.

"And who is this lovely lady?" The man squinted at her, his murky pupils suddenly dilating.

Adrian Roland subtly shifted to shield her completely. "Mr. Zhang, your presence honors my father's birthday celebration."

Zhang Mingxuan bared yellowed teeth. "Heard your engagement was called off. Found a new plaything? Need introductions to some directors? We're casting for a big production..."

A wave of putrid breath accompanied his words.

Stella's stomach churned. She instinctively covered her nose.

"Mr. Zhang, you—" Adrian frowned, stepping back.

The man sniffed his sleeve hastily. "Ah, got carried away last night. Spilled lube all over myself."

"Lube?" Stella glanced at Adrian in confusion.

A flush crept up his neck. "I'll explain later."

Zhang leered. "How innocent. But a strong man like Mr. Roland wouldn't need—"

She felt Adrian's arm muscles tense instantly.

The banquet lasted until midnight.

After the last guests departed, Stella could barely stand. Her heels had rubbed raw blisters. Leaning against the wall, she inhaled sharply.

"Don't move."

Suddenly she was airborne. Adrian carried her through astonished stares toward the garden.

Moonlight illuminated a gently swaying swing.

Kneeling, he carefully removed her shoes. The alcohol swab stung her broken skin, but his warm fingertips sent tremors through her heart.

"You always..." His voice dropped. "Wore heels that didn't fit."

Memories flooded back—the boy who'd carried her through campus, always with star candies in his pocket, always keeping size 35 flats in his locker.

"Those were good days." She gazed at the stars.

When her father was alive. Before her mother fell ill. When he was still the boy who'd pluck stars from the sky for her.

"Little star." He looked up, moonlight reflecting in his eyes. "Can we—"

CRASH.

A flowerpot shattered nearby.

Adrian instantly shielded her. "Who's there?"

"Oops, my apologies..." Wang Youcai staggered from the shadows with a slimy smile. "Needed some air... didn't mean to interrupt..."

Stella's nails dug into her palms.

"Perhaps you don't know, Mr. Roland." Wang's voice turned venomous. "Your wife is quite... spirited. Last time she had some wild man beat me up. The way they clung together on that motorcycle..."
###Chapter 328: I Care

Was William Rubenstein here to make accusations?

Stella Valentine's fingertips trembled slightly as she instinctively grasped Adrian Roland's sleeve. His large hand immediately covered hers, their fingers intertwining as she felt the warmth of his palm.

"What a coincidence," Adrian said with a cold smile. "Every time my wife meets a friend, you just happen to be there."

William's beady eyes darted past Adrian's shoulder, lingering on Stella. "Isn't that right? Though it's even more interesting how Mrs. Roland always rushes to deny any connection to you."

"Oh?"

"She claims you two went your separate ways long ago. As for that 'friend'..." William's voice dripped with sarcasm as he dragged out the word, "someone nearly cracked my skull open for her. Quite the friendship, huh?"

Adrian adjusted his cufflinks lazily. "My wife's affairs are none of your concern, Mr. Rubenstein."

He turned to leave with Stella, but William blocked their path. "Don't be in such a hurry, Mr. Roland! Your wife here is quite remarkable—" His words cut off abruptly as his gaze locked onto the faint bandage peeking from Adrian's collar.

"That injury..." William's eyes gleamed. "A wound on the throat can be deadly. Shouldn't you see a doctor?"

He gestured toward Adrian's height, raising his voice deliberately. Guests began gathering at the commotion, even Alexander Heilbronn pushing through the crowd.

"My God!" Alexander exclaimed. "What happened to your neck?"

Adrian adjusted his bowtie, but the slender column of his throat remained exposed. "Just a scratch."

"A scratch on the throat?" William fanned the flames. "Could it be... domestic violence?"

Gasps rippled through the onlookers. Stella dug her nails into her palm, leaning close to whisper in Adrian's ear, "Say I did it."

He arched a brow.

"Better than them knowing you hurt him," she said tightly. "At worst... I'll be labeled a shrew."

"I care."

The two words were feather-light yet struck Stella's heart like a hammer. She looked up at him—those star-filled eyes now reflecting her panicked expression.

"What happened last time," his Adam's apple bobbed, "won't happen again."

William's sneer interrupted their moment. "Don't tell me you're going to claim those are nail marks, Mrs. Roland?"

Stella took a deep breath. "Actually, I—"

"Bullshit!" William suddenly roared. "The night I was attacked, the culprit had scratch marks on his neck too!" He pulled out his phone and waved it. "I have medical reports and surveillance screenshots. Care to see, Mr. Roland?"

Alexander suddenly interjected in English, "They're clearly devoted to each other!"

"Devoted?" William smirked. "Then it makes even more sense that Mr. Roland attacked someone to protect his wife." He stepped closer. "Shall I call the police, or will you turn yourself in?"

Adrian's gaze turned glacial. "Looking to die?"

"I'm terrified~" William clutched his chest dramatically. "I just wonder... is Mrs. Roland afraid of accidents?"
###Chapter 329: Try Touching Her, I Dare You!

Stella Valentine's wrist was suddenly seized.

The man's palm burned against her skin, his grip so tight it threatened to crush her bones.

William Rubenstein puffed out his beer belly, grinning with greasy satisfaction. "Let everyone bear witness! If that bandage on Mr. Roland's neck hides a knife wound, it proves he's the one who attacked me!"

Adrian Roland's gaze turned glacial.

He released Stella and closed the distance between them in two strides, his voice dangerously low. "Name your terms."

"So you admit it?"

"Cut the crap."

"I want the Alexander gemstone shipment."

"Done."

"Free of charge." William's beady eyes narrowed. "Ninety percent."

Adrian's jaw tightened. "Ambitious."

"A small price for Mrs. Roland's safety, no?" William lowered his voice. "You've made plenty of enemies over the years. Imagine if they discovered your weakness..."

"You wouldn't dare."

"Not me. But what about the families of those CEOs you drove to suicide?" William smirked. "I hear your wife has been going out alone lately..."

Murderous intent flashed in Adrian's eyes.

"Ninety percent for her protection—a fair trade." William rubbed his hands. "Don't you agree?"

"Deal." Adrian's voice could freeze hell. "But if word of this spreads—"

Before he could finish, Stella yanked his tie.

Rising on her toes, she ripped off the bandage and sank her teeth into the wound.

A sharp hiss escaped Adrian.

Blood trickled down Stella's chin.

The crowd erupted.

"Oh my God!"

"Domestic violence? In public?"

Wiping her mouth, Stella glared with wide eyes. "That's for refusing to buy me that purse!"

William gaped.

The spectators exploded into chatter.

"So it was a bite mark?"

"She went feral..."

"Who knew Mr. Roland was into that?"

As whispers swirled, Adrian's throat bobbed, his gaze darkening.

Stella's ears burned scarlet, but she lifted her chin defiantly. "What? Never seen married couples play rough?"

Julian Valois appeared with perfect timing. "Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served in the—"

The dispersing crowd kept murmuring.

"The Ice King is whipped by his wife?"

"No wonder he rejected those socialites—he likes them wild..."

Stella's legs trembled, barely supporting her.

Suddenly, Adrian cupped the back of her head and licked the wound with deliberate pressure.

"Good performance," he murmured, lips curling. "Shall we continue tonight?"
###Chapter 330: Don't Worry, It Doesn't Hurt

Julian Valois coughed lightly and turned away. "They've all left."

Stella Valentine wished the ground would swallow her whole.

That impulsive moment now filled her with unbearable shame.

Adrian Roland looked down at the petite woman, her face a picture of regret like a startled rabbit.

He chuckled softly, stepping forward to shield her. "Thanks."

Julian raised an eyebrow. "No need. You've helped me too."

"Us?"

"Indirectly."

Adrian frowned. "Business?"

"It's about Joy Fairsprene."

"Joy? What does she have to do with me?"

Julian suddenly grew serious. "Adrian, have you ever experienced strange memories?"

"What do you mean?"

"Like suddenly recalling scenes you've never lived through."

Adrian's gaze sharpened. "Why ask that?"

"So you have."

"I need to confirm something."

Adrian stared at him. "Ever since I woke from the accident, you've been looking at me oddly. Do you know something?"

Julian sighed. "I do know certain things. About you and Stella. But I'm unsure if I should say."

"If it concerns Stella, I must know."

"But the truth might hurt her."

Adrian suddenly smiled. "Then forget it."

"Really don't want to know?"

"I do. But if it harms her, I'd rather never know."

Julian murmured, "You haven't changed."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Nothing." Julian clapped his shoulder. "If you two reconcile, I'll tell you everything."

"Deal."

"I'm going to find Joy."

Adrian teased, "So anxious? Think she'll disappear from my house?"

Julian gave a wry smile. "Different troubles, similar situations. Go check on Stella—she doesn't look well."

Adrian turned to see Stella still standing there, her slender frame looking fragile.

"Stella?"

She whirled around. "Yes?"

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing."

"Don't worry, it doesn't hurt."

Stella stole a glance at his neck. "I'm just... now all of Houston knows we..."

"Afraid Mr. Alistair will find out?" Adrian's voice softened. "If he returns, I'll explain."

Stella shook her head. "He won't come back."

"Why would he leave you?"

"He had no choice."

"What reason could justify abandoning you?"

She bit her lip. "My existence would hinder him."

Adrian suddenly grew impassioned. "What nonsense! Would his success magically appear without you? Were foolish kings in history suddenly wise just because they lacked beautiful companions?"

Stella stared at him, startled. "You..."

"If it were me, I'd never sacrifice love for ambition."

Her smile turned bitter. "You were quite decisive when you chose Lily Savigny."

"That was during a bipolar episode—I couldn't control myself—"

"Enough." Stella cut him off. "Let's get that bite treated. It's deep—we can't let David Rubenstein notice."
###Chapter 331: His Trump Card

Stella Valentine deliberately avoided any mention of Mr. Alistair.

Adrian Roland keenly sensed her resistance.

"Alright," he conceded quietly.

Stella hastily gestured toward the front hall. "I need to find Joy."

Before he could respond, she was already lifting the hem of her dress and hurrying away.

"How adorable she looks in heels..."

That voice—

Adrian whirled around, his pupils contracting sharply. "What are you doing here?"

Grant Rubenstein leaned on his cane, his smile sinister. "Uncle Xavier sent me to deliver birthday gifts." His gaze lingered on the bite mark on Adrian's neck. "Miss Valentine certainly left quite a mark."

Adrian instinctively recoiled from the man. "None of your concern."

"Don't be so tense." Grant's grin widened. "I'm just here to remind you—Uncle Xavier still doesn't know about your heroic rescue."

"Planning to snitch?"

"I don't have that kind of free time." Grant spread his hands. "But... if Uncle loses faith in you, I'll be his only choice."

Adrian scoffed. "Finally showing your true colors."

"Hah! That's more like you." Grant suddenly lowered his voice. "Want to know Mr. Alistair's real identity?"

Adrian's expression hardened.

"He resembles you for a reason." Grant leaned closer. "He's your twin brother."

"Ridiculous!" Adrian snapped. "Everyone in Houston knows the Roland family only has one son."

"But your brother was declared 'stillborn' at birth, wasn't he?" Grant's tone dripped with implication. "This came straight from Mr. Alistair himself."

Adrian froze as if struck by lightning.

"Miss Valentine had one condition for him—" Grant enunciated each word. "As long as it wasn't you."

The words stabbed like a knife through his heart.

"Painful, isn't it?" Grant savored his reaction. "She'd rather choose a substitute than forgive you."

Adrian suddenly laughed. "David wants the gemstones. You want Uncle Xavier's empire. Quite the appetite."

"I have no interest in your woman." Grant waved dismissively. "But... what if I told you that car crash that put you in a coma? Uncle Xavier ordered it."

The air turned glacial.

"I was the driver." Grant's smile turned cruel. "Ask him yourself if you don't believe me."

A deadly chill radiated from Adrian.

"Once you've confirmed the truth, we'll talk business." Grant turned to leave but paused. "I hold the trump card to win Stella back. Trade me Uncle Xavier's empire for it."
###Chapter 332: The Secret of Sharing a Bed

The number of guests had more than doubled beyond expectations.

Stella Valentine navigated through the crowd, finally spotting Joy Fairsprene and Julian Valois in a corner of the banquet hall.

"No! Absolutely not!" Joy stomped her foot angrily. "Stella just escaped that marriage, and now you want her to jump back into the fire?"

Julian opened his mouth to speak but fell silent when he noticed Stella approaching from the corner of his eye.

"Miss Valentine." He gave a slight nod.

Stella returned the gesture. "Thank you for stepping in earlier, Mr. Valois."

"Why thank him?" Joy grabbed Stella's wrist. "He actually wants you to get back together with Adrian!"

Julian rubbed his temples. "I merely suggested giving each other a chance to reconnect."

"That won't be necessary." Stella's smile was distant. "As Mr. Alistair's friend and the only one who knows everything, why would you suddenly make such a suggestion? Was it his idea?"

"No." Julian shook his head. "He never mentioned it."

"So it was your own suggestion?"

"...I just want good people to find happiness."

Stella let out a soft laugh. "My future is mine to decide."

After a moment of silence, Julian finally nodded. "I understand."

"Right now, I only want to care for my children, complete Celeste's surgery, and run my company well." Stella gazed out the window. "The memories Mr. Alistair left me will warm the rest of my days."

Julian's expression turned complicated. "Keeping secrets is truly agonizing."

"About Mr. Alistair's secret?"

"...Yes."

"I'll listen whenever you're ready to share. If you choose not to, I won't press you."

Julian smiled bitterly. "Let me think about it a little longer."

"What kind of riddle are you two talking about?" Joy tugged impatiently at Stella. "Come on, let's talk privately."

Joy briskly pulled her upstairs.

"Which one is your bedroom?"

"This one."

Joy pushed the door open, then gasped at the sight inside. "Oh my god! Stella, since when did you become so... open?!"

Stella followed her gaze—

A navy blue tie draped casually over the headboard. Several men's dress shirts lay scattered at the foot of the bed.

"These aren't..." Stella walked over and began folding the clothes neatly.

Joy's eyes widened. "You brought Dr. Melford back to the Roland estate overnight? That's wild!"

"Don't be ridiculous." Stella frowned. "Dr. Melford and I have a purely professional relationship."

"Then whose are these?"

"...Adrian's."

"What?!" Joy grabbed her shoulders. "Have you lost your mind? You let Adrian into your bedroom?!"

Stella swayed dizzily from the shaking. "Wait... let go first..."

Joy immediately released her. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Stella rubbed her temples. "Just a little lightheaded."

"Then did you hear what I said?"

"Yes."

"You have to be careful around him!"

"This is his bedroom. How exactly should I be careful?"

Joy's voice rose an octave. "You... you're sharing a bed with him?!"

Footsteps sounded in the hallway, and Stella motioned for silence.

Joy lowered her voice urgently. "What's really going on? You're not using Adrian as a substitute for Mr. Alistair, are you?"

"I'm not..."

"Then why move into the Roland estate? And share a room with him?"

It took Stella nearly an hour to explain everything.

When she finished, Joy looked stunned. "So... Adrian knows things only Mr. Alistair would know?"

"The crabapple blossoms at Mount Rainier. The stars at the summit. Those were private memories between Mr. Alistair and me."

"Could Mr. Alistair have told him before...?"

Stella shook her head. "Impossible. We went straight from Mount Rainier to the airport that day. There was no time to tell anyone."

"This is too bizarre..." Joy ran a hand through her hair. "Twin telepathy?"

"Even the psychologist couldn't explain it."

"So you're living with him, being so close... for Grandpa Edward?"

Stella nodded. "Grandpa Edward doesn't have much time left. I want to give him peace."

"I see." Joy suddenly frowned. "Wait, how did you know Adrian and I were in the backyard—"

"The whole party is talking about it!" Joy rolled her eyes. "They're saying CEO Roland is terrified of his wife—that you bit his neck bloody and he didn't dare make a sound..."
###Chapter 333: I Once Wore a Wedding Gown

"Stella, what if... Adrian could inherit all of Mr. Alistair's memories? Would you accept him?"

Joy's question made Stella's breath catch.

Mr. Alistair's face. Mr. Alistair's memories...

She pressed her lips together. "Their voices are different. I can tell."

"Right!" Joy clapped. "You can alter a face with surgery, but not a voice. Even identical twins have differences."

Stella lowered her lashes.

That day outside the private dining club, Adrian's entrance had mirrored Mr. Alistair's perfectly.

Every detail identical.

Could it really be coincidence?

"Let's not dwell on this," Joy changed the subject. "How are Celeste's surgery preparations going?"

"The liver donor match was successful."

"That's wonderful..." Joy's voice suddenly thickened. "If only Oliver could've waited for a match..."

The little boy who once sang "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" would forever remain seven years old.

Stella squeezed her trembling friend's hand. "He's reunited with his mother in heaven now."

"I just can't stand it!" Joy wiped angry tears. "That trash Lily gets to live happily while—just last week I saw her letting her son lift girls' skirts at the mall!"

"She actually has a child?"

"Unfortunately!" Joy scoffed. "The kid's got shifty eyes—must take after his father. But—" She lowered her voice. "Want me to dig up some intel?"

Stella arched a brow. "Using Victor as your informant again?"

"This time's different!" Joy's ears turned pink. "We're... getting engaged."

"Really?"

"He got drunk and dragged me to the Valois estate to announce it." Joy's eyes sparkled. "Said he'd marry me even if his whole family objected."

Stella smiled genuinely. "Congratulations."

"Funny how life works," Joy mused, propping her chin on her hand. "You had kids first, but I'll be the one wearing a wedding gown first."

"...I've worn one too."

"When?"

"That day."

Under the crabapple tree four years ago, with a white dress shirt for a veil and heaven as their witness.

That two-person wedding had been her closest brush with happiness.

Until blood stained the rain.

"Help! Emergency!"

A scream shattered the memory.
###Chapter 334: The Truth Emerges

Stella Valentine stood frozen in place after hearing those words.

She exhaled slowly. "Now I understand why that memory means so much to you."

Tears welled up in her eyes. "Such beautiful moments would stay with anyone forever."

Adrian Roland pulled a tissue from his bag and handed it to her. "Dry your eyes. Why are you crying now?"

"This story breaks my heart!" Stella took the tissue, but her tears fell harder. "Who is this Uncle Xavier anyway? Does he have some royal throne to pass down? And if he values Mr. Alistair's abilities so much, how could he think emotions would hinder his career? It makes no sense!"

Adrian chuckled softly.

Time had passed, and they were no longer young, yet Stella still retained that innocence.

"I don't know the details. Mr. Alistair only mentioned that Uncle Xavier helped him."

"Helped him?"

"Yes." Adrian nodded. "He rarely speaks of his past. I suspect Uncle Xavier took him in after he was abandoned."

Stella frowned. "That... If it's both a life debt and raising him, it's complicated."

"So I understand why he chose to leave now."

"But how could Uncle Xavier risk Mr. Alistair actually dying in that car crash? It was a rainy highway!"

Adrian shook his head. "I don't know. Maybe the driver was highly skilled?"

"By the way, Uncle Xavier must be quite old now, right?"

She thought for a moment. "I've seen him a few times. He's frail and uses a wheelchair."

"Then it's simple!" Stella suddenly perked up. "It's not the nicest thought, but we can just wait until he... passes. Then no one can stop Mr. Alistair!"

A knock sounded at the door.

Stella called out, "Who is it?"

No answer came, but the door opened gently. Julian Valois slipped inside, nodding first to Stella—only to be met with a glare.

He turned to Adrian. "It's time for Grandpa's cake. The kids are waiting."

Adrian stood. "Let's go."

Stella grabbed her arm. "Don't! What if Mr. Alistair misunderstands and thinks you're with Julian? He doesn't know this is just an act! We agreed—once Uncle Xavier is... gone, you can be together!"

"Uncle Xavier?"

Julian whirled around. "Did you just say 'wait until who... is gone'?"

Stella rolled her eyes. "None of your business! Julian, Adrian is only humoring you out of kindness. Don't get any ideas! When Mr. Alistair returns, they belong together! Hey—what are you doing?!"

Julian stepped forward abruptly, making Stella yelp in surprise.

Adrian immediately shielded her, meeting Julian's sharp gaze. "Stella means well. Touch her, and you'll regret it."

Julian gave a bitter laugh. "Regret what?"

"You—"

"Little Star," he said softly, "we've known each other over a decade. Do you really see me that way?"

Adrian pressed her lips together, arms still outstretched protectively. "The old you wasn't like this. But you have bipolar disorder. I can't take the risk."

He froze, then covered his eyes with a hand, laughing mirthlessly. "Right. I have bipolar disorder..."

"You..." Adrian softened her tone. "Just calm down and talk."

"I am calm. Stella helped you. I remember that. Besides, she's with Harry Vance. What could I possibly do to her?"

"Then why did you—"

"I just need to confirm one thing." Gently, he moved her arm aside and locked eyes with Stella. "You said Mr. Alistair will return once someone... is gone. Who is this person?"

Stella hesitated, then blurted, "Uncle Xavier! Some old man in a wheelchair! He's the one keeping Mr. Alistair away. Once he's... gone, Mr. Alistair will come back, and you're out of the picture!"

Julian's expression shifted drastically. "Uncle Xavier... How do you know about him?"

"Why do you care—"

"Answer me!"

"Stop yelling! You're the one who asked—"

"Stella!"

"What?!"

"Please..." Julian's breathing grew ragged, his voice pleading. "This matters to me. Tell me."

Caught off guard by his sudden vulnerability, Stella stammered, "I... heard it somewhere."

"From whom?"

"From—"

Adrian intervened. "From me. Is there a problem?"

Julian looked as if struck by lightning. "You know Uncle Xavier?"

"Not well. I've met him a few times." A realization dawned on her. "You know him too?"

His silence spoke volumes.

Adrian was stunned. "Since when?"

"Long ago. After my parents' accident, when you went abroad, Uncle Xavier gave me the seed money to rebuild New Frontier Group."

"Then... do you know about the young man he favors? Around your age, similar height..."

"Does he also look exactly like me?"

Adrian went silent.

Julian smiled, but his eyes glistened. "Now I finally understand why you mistook me for him."

"..."

"At Rainier's peak, under the crabapple tree—those fragments in my dreams were your memories with Mr. Alistair. You consulted a psychologist to figure out why I could dream them, didn't you?"

"..."

"How laughable." His smile was more painful than tears. "I tried so hard to become him, thinking it would bring me closer to you."

"..."

"In the end... I lost to my own twin brother."
###Chapter 335: Daddy Needs One Hand to Hold Mommy

"Master Adrian, Madam Stella, the guests are waiting for the cake-cutting ceremony!" Benjamin Langley's voice came from outside the door.

Luna Roland tiptoed and tapped lightly on the door with her small hand. "Mommy, Daddy, the cake smells so good!"

Celeste Roland chimed in with her sweet, childish voice. "And it has strawberries on top!"

The atmosphere inside the room froze instantly.

Joy Fairsprene was still reeling from shock, while Adrian Roland and Stella Valentine's carefully constructed facade of marital bliss shattered completely.

Adrian took a deep breath and extended his arm. "It's Grandfather Edward's birthday banquet. After this, I'll take you to see Uncle Xavier."

Stella's head snapped up.

"Mr. Alistair probably doesn't live there anymore," he said quietly. "You can ask him anything you want."

After a moment of silence, Stella finally looped her arm through his.

Outside, Luna tilted her head and asked Benjamin, "Grandpa Benjamin, are Mommy and Daddy asleep?"

"They're coming out now!" Benjamin suddenly announced.

The door opened, revealing the striking couple. The man stood tall like a pine tree, while the woman exuded gentle grace. The children stared in awe.

"Where's Ethan?" Adrian asked.

Benjamin chuckled. "Downstairs with the old master. He's introducing our little heir to all the guests."

Stella frowned. "He's only eight..."

"Master Adrian was analyzing financial statements at that age!" Benjamin said dismissively.

Stella opened her mouth to protest but suddenly blushed, remembering something. She had met Adrian when he was just fifteen or sixteen.

Celeste tugged at Luna's sleeve and whispered, "Sister, Mommy and Daddy are so pretty."

Luna pinched her sister's cheek. "You'll grow up to be just as pretty."

"Really?" Celeste's eyes sparkled. "But I don't look like them..."

"I didn't either when I was little," Luna said wisely, sounding like a miniature adult.

Adrian crouched down. "Want Daddy to carry you?"

Celeste blinked. "Can't you carry both me and Sister?"

"Sorry, sweetheart," Adrian said gently. "Daddy needs one hand to hold Mommy."

Celeste immediately turned to Stella. "Then I want Mommy to carry me!"

Stella hesitated, concerned about Adrian's injured hand, but he had already scooped Luna up effortlessly with one arm. The little girl gasped and wrapped her arms around his neck.

"Mommy can't carry both of us," Celeste said sensibly.

Reluctantly, Stella released Adrian's arm and picked up her younger daughter.

"Daddy, hold Mommy's hand!" Luna wriggled in Adrian's arms.

Adrian glanced at Stella, noticing she was already struggling with Celeste's weight.

"Daddy can put his arm around Mommy's waist!" Celeste declared suddenly. "I saw lots of uncles and aunties doing that abroad!"

Stella nearly choked. "When did you see that?"

"From the window!" Celeste said innocently. "And some uncles and aunties were even—"

Stella clapped a hand over her daughter's mouth and hurried downstairs with her.

Adrian suppressed a laugh and followed. Benjamin called after them, "Madam Stella, slow down! What if you're—"

Stella quickened her pace.

When the family of five appeared at the top of the staircase, the banquet hall erupted in murmurs.

"Is...is that Mr. Roland's children?"

"That boy looks at least seven or eight!"

Adrian ignored the whispers and waved. "Ethan!"

The overwhelmed little boy immediately broke free from the crowd of guests and ran to them. Adrian wrapped an arm around his son and announced clearly, "This is my son Ethan, and my daughters Luna and Celeste. I hope you'll all look out for them in the future."
###Chapter 336: The Feeling of Being Cherished

The banquet hall fell silent the moment Adrian Roland made his entrance.

All eyes turned toward him.

"Mr. Roland retiring at such a young age? Isn't it too soon?"

"Indeed. Even us old-timers haven't stepped down yet."

"The Roland family has worthy successors. The young master is exceptionally bright, and the two little misses are simply radiant."

Luna quietly tugged at Celeste's sleeve. "Hear that? Everyone's praising you."

Celeste shyly glanced back at Stella Valentine.

Stella gently pulled her into an embrace. "Your sister's right. Our Celeste is the sweetest."

Only then did the little girl break into a delighted smile.

"It's time for the birthday cake!"

Servants wheeled in a towering seven-tiered cake. Benjamin Langley hurried over, followed closely by Joy Fairsprene.

Julian Valois swiftly pulled Joy to his side.

Edward Roland, dressed in a deep red traditional jacket, looked less vigorous than before but still sharp-eyed.

He handed the cake knife to Adrian.

"Grandfather, you should do the honors."

"Who said you're cutting it?" The old man huffed. "Your hand is injured. I meant for you to give the knife to Stella. She's given our family three children—today, she's the one who cuts it!"

The guests, all shrewd observers, immediately grasped his intention.

Stella's sudden public appearance would inevitably raise questions. Edward's words were meant to legitimize her status.

Warmth spread through Stella's chest.

How long had it been since someone stood up for her like this?

Just as her eyes began to sting, the child in her arms was lifted away.

Adrian held both children effortlessly and grinned at his grandfather. "This isn't just a cake knife—it's practically a family heirloom. Are you handing it straight to your granddaughter-in-law?"

"You rascal!" Edward chuckled. "You're just worried your wife's arms will get tired from holding them."

"They are heavy. She's carried them all this time—today, it's my turn."

"Stella's lost weight. You'd better take better care of her from now on."

"Of course. She's the only granddaughter-in-law for me. As for whose grandson I am—that hardly matters."

Their playful banter showered Stella with respect.

But she heard the unspoken message beneath his words.

He was leaving her an escape route.

When she turned to look at him, he deliberately avoided her gaze.

A sharp pang struck her heart.

"Mommy?" Luna looked up at her with concern.

"I'm fine."

Adrian frowned. "Chest pain? Is it—"

"Just from standing in heels too long," she murmured.

His shoulders relaxed visibly. "You should've worn flats."

Stella accepted the cake knife. "Then I'll graciously accept the honor."

The seven-tiered cake stood nearly seven feet tall.

By the fourth tier, she couldn't reach any higher.

"Need a stool?" Benjamin asked.

Suddenly, Adrian knelt and gathered her skirt.

In the next instant, she was hoisted effortlessly onto his shoulders.

"Steady?"

"Ah—!"

Her startled gasp echoed as she was lifted to the cake's full height.

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

"My God! Mr. Roland is that strong?"

"Just who is this Mrs. Roland?"

"To tame an iceberg CEO like this—she's no ordinary woman."
###Chapter 337: I Know My Place

Stella's body tensed instantly.

"Daydreaming? Afraid of heights?" Adrian's warm voice came from behind as his steady hand supported her waist. "Don't worry, I've got you."

"It's not that..." she murmured softly.

She had never feared heights.

But this position felt achingly familiar.

At seventeen, they had squeezed into the back row of a concert. Too short to see, she'd hopped like a rabbit, straining for a glimpse.

Without hesitation, Adrian had lifted her onto his shoulders, holding her there for the entire four-hour show.

Had she been afraid then?

Not at all.

Because she knew that boy would shield her from the sky itself if it fell.

But now...

"Little Star?" Adrian's voice pulled her back to the present.

Gripping the cake knife, she leaned forward decisively. The blade sliced through the frosting in a perfect arc.

Adrian lowered her slowly, only straightening when her feet touched solid ground.

"Adrian, Little Star," Elder Roland's eyes glistened. "This is the best birthday gift I've ever received."

Adrian's hand still hovered protectively at her waist. "As long as you're happy."

"My happiness doesn't matter. What matters is..." The old man's voice cracked. "After I'm gone, you two must take care of each other."

Stella's heart clenched. "Grandfather Roland, you'll live to be a hundred!"

"Silly child..." He waved dismissively. "No more sad talk today. Let's serve the cake!"

Guests swarmed forward, reducing the seven-tiered cake to an empty frame within minutes.

Benjamin approached with two plates. "Luna, Celeste, go play with your brother."

Once the children scampered off, the old man's expression darkened. "The master likely... won't last three months."

Stella's fingers turned icy.

How could the mischievous old man who spiked pear tea with deer blood tonic suddenly...

"The master forbade us from telling." Benjamin wiped his face. "He just wants to see you reconciled before... for peace."

"What if we keep pretending—"

"It won't work." Benjamin pressed their hands together. "The Roland family only has the young master left. Little Star, don't wait until it's too late for regrets."

Luna's distant call sent Benjamin hurrying away.

"Stella..." Adrian's voice emerged raw and broken. "Promise me one thing."

Darkness brought the flood of memories.

That rainy night, kneeling before her, his forehead pressed to her hand.

"Don't leave me..."

"I have nothing left..."

"Stella, say you won't go..."

"I know my place." Adrian suddenly smiled, the light in his eyes dimming. "After Grandfather... I won't stop you if you want to leave."

Stella clenched her skirt. "...Mm."

His smile deepened, more painful than any tears.

Alexander barged in, slinging an arm around Adrian. "You've been hiding this masterpiece!"

"Ever heard of a golden cage?" Adrian arched a brow.

"A what?"

"A house made of gold to hide your beloved."

"Wow!" Alexander clutched his chest dramatically. "Then why bring her out?"

Adrian shot him a look. "Only because you insisted."

"Hah!" Alexander roared with laughter, producing a contract. "Sign this! With the way you two are, you'd stay married even if the Pacific dried up!"
###Chapter 338: Only You Were Acting, Not Me

The phrase "a golden house for a cherished beauty" lingered on Stella Valentine's tongue.

Her fingers unconsciously traced the jade bracelet on her wrist. The ancient tale carried an ominous weight she couldn't shake.

Alexander Heilbronn remained oblivious to her unease, eagerly pressing, "Well? Will you sign?"

Adrian Roland tapped the table lightly. "I was the impatient one before. Now it's your turn to be restless?"

"Ah, I just want to experience a grand romance..."

"Never had one?"

"A few. But they only wanted my gemstones." Alexander sighed dramatically. "A lasting love like yours and Stella's is rare. Teach me—how does one win a woman like her?"

Adrian glanced back at Stella, clearing his throat. "...Relentless pursuit."

"What?"

"No shame. No retreat."

Alexander's eyes widened. "That simple?"

"Of course not." Adrian's voice lowered. "Memorize her habits. Carry her favorite snacks. Sneak her out for dates when her parents aren't looking."

"Sounds easy enough."

"The crucial part—" Adrian's gaze darkened. "Believe her unconditionally. Even if you see or hear otherwise, if she denies it, you deny it too."

Alexander thumped his chest. "Consider it done!"

The pen glided across the contract. Both copies were secured.

Alexander suddenly turned serious. "Shipping costs are on you."

"Understood."

"I fly home tomorrow." He winked at Stella. "Can't wait to see what masterpieces you'll create with these raw stones."

"Not staying longer?"

"No." His grin turned teasing. "Watching you two is giving me ideas. Time to find my own leading lady."

Stella stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her shadow stretching long in the sunlight.

She observed the men's animated discussion. Only when the contracts were signed did her tension ease slightly.

One matter settled. Now for the next...

"Penny for your thoughts?"

Adrian's voice, warm and familiar, brushed her ear.

She shook her head. "Everything finalized?"

"Thanks to you." His gaze burned. "This deal wouldn't have happened without you."

"Wendy Evans could've—"

"Alexander would've seen through her." Adrian stepped closer. "Know why?"

"Why?"

His breath tickled her earlobe. "Because only you were acting. Not me."

...

Dusk settled as guests departed.

Adrian never released her hand, his touch a steady comfort. When the last visitor left, only swaying lanterns illuminated the courtyard.

Benjamin Langley approached with juice glasses. "The master and children have retired."

"Thank you." Adrian accepted the drinks. "Stella and I are stepping out."

"This late?"

"Yes."

Understanding dawned on Benjamin's face. "Go on then! Young love shouldn't keep office hours."

A silver Lexus waited silently in the garage.

Stella blinked at the understated vehicle. "Where's your Porsche?"

"Flooded." Adrian opened her door. "That storm four years ago submerged the entire underground lot."

"All those cars—"

"Mr. Xavier said they were totaled." He turned the ignition. "Probably rusting in some junkyard now."

"Mr. Xavier?" Her brow furrowed. "You and Mr. Alistair both mention him."

"Yes. He saved both our lives."

The words pricked like a needle.

Why would a butler hold such significance for the Roland brothers?

The car sliced through the night as briny sea air seeped through the vents.

"We're here." Adrian parked smoothly. "Go ahead. I'll join you shortly."

Stella understood his tact.

Some conversations required privacy.

The villa's doorbell chimed sharply in the silent darkness.
###Chapter 339: I Am Mr. Alistair

"It must be Adrian arriving. Grant, open the door!"

"Uncle Xavier, Mr. Roland didn't mention he was coming."

"Just do as I say!"

The door swung open violently. Grant Rubenstein and the person outside froze simultaneously.

He narrowed his eyes, a mocking smile curling his lips. "What an unexpected guest, Miss Valentine."

"I need to speak with Uncle Xavier."

"For Mr. Alistair?"

"Yes."

Grant blocked the doorway. "Then I'll have to ask if Uncle Xavier wishes to see you first."

"Tell him if he refuses, I'll make sure his retirement is anything but peaceful."

"Well, well. You've grown bolder over the years." He deliberately stepped aside. "I like that."

Stella marched inside without hesitation.

Grant pretended to stop her but let her pass. His fingers traced the curve of his cane as calculation flickered in his eyes. The murkier the water, the easier to catch the fish.

Uncle Xavier was polishing a fishing rod when footsteps approached. Without looking up, he asked, "Adrian?"

"It's me."

The old man's hands trembled. The rod clattered to the floor. "How did you find this place?"

Stella stood firm. "I'll leave after my questions are answered."

"We had an agreement. Once you secured the liver donor, you'd leave Houston."

"Afraid I'll ruin Mr. Alistair's future?"

"If you know, why ask?"

"You care so much about him—is it because of his abilities, or..." She paused. "Because you raised him yourself?"

Uncle Xavier's face darkened. "How dare you!"

"I'm more curious what kind of guardian would send someone to run over the child they raised!"

"Get out!"

"One last question." Stella took a step closer. "First—was Mr. Alistair an orphan you found?"

"...Yes."

"What name did he use in school?"

"My memory fails me in old age."

"You can't even remember a name?" Her laugh was icy. "Then what do you call him? Surely not 'Mr. Alistair' every day?"

Beads of sweat formed on Uncle Xavier's forehead. He suddenly gestured for Grant.

As Grant approached, the old man whispered, "You said he lost his memory. How could he have told this woman his name?"

Grant glanced at Stella. "She's bluffing."

Relieved, Uncle Xavier snapped, "Adrian is not Mr. Alistair!"

"But he said his name is Adrian Roland."

"Nonsense!"

A glint flashed in Stella's eyes. "Second question—you gave all your assets to Adrian. What about Mr. Alistair?"

"My property goes to whomever I choose!"

"If you picked Adrian, why tear Mr. Alistair and me apart?"

"I despise the sight of you!"

Stella smiled faintly. "Funny. At Grandpa Edward's birthday banquet today, Adrian announced I'm his wife."

Both Uncle Xavier and Grant stiffened.

"He actually..."

"Connecting all the clues, there's only one conclusion—"

"I am Mr. Alistair."

The deep voice came from the doorway.

Silhouetted against the light, Adrian Roland strode forward. His black suit accentuated his tall frame, the purple tie gleaming coldly. Only his hoarse voice differed—

"No twin brother. No sibling. Mr. Alistair is me."

Stella's breath hitched.

The furrow of his brows, his gait, even the slight lift of his hand—every mannerism matched her memories of Mr. Alistair perfectly.

Uncle Xavier turned ashen. "You..."

"Everything came back." Adrian's gaze burned. "No more acting, Uncle Xavier."
###Chapter 340: The Truth Revealed

The walnut in Mr. Xavier Atlante's hand clattered to the wooden floor, rolling far away.

It stopped near Grant Rubenstein's cane. As he bent to pick it up, his knuckles turned white from the force of his grip. "You truly remember everything now?"

Adrian Roland's gaze swept past him, landing on Stella Valentine. The sharpness in his eyes melted into tenderness. "Stella, I'm late."

Her pupils trembled. "You..."

"Our four-year promise—I never forgot." He reached out, brushing away nonexistent dust from her shoulder. "I only forgot who I was. The stars over Mount Rainier are just as beautiful as they were four years ago."

The words "four-year promise" struck like thunder.

Stella staggered back half a step, gripping the armrest to steady herself.

Mr. Alistair... was Adrian Roland?

How could that be?

Grant chuckled, leaning on his cane. "Mr. Roland, are you having another episode? I know some excellent psychiatrists."

"Thanks to you." Adrian shielded Stella behind him, his eyes icy. "It was the doctor you sent who helped me remember my other identity."

The cane left deep marks in the carpet.

"Ridiculous!" Mr. Xavier shattered his teacup. "Ever since meeting this woman, you've lost your mind!"

"Uncle Xavier." Adrian's voice was calm as the sea. "The car accident four years ago—that was your doing, wasn't it? The businesses I've managed for you these years have repaid my debt to you."

Mr. Xavier's face paled.

Grant suddenly laughed. "Miss Valentine knows best—Mr. Alistair and Mr. Roland are clearly two different people."

All eyes turned to Stella.

She studied the faint lines between Adrian's brows—the same creases Mr. Alistair always had from frowning.

"Under the crabapple tree..." Adrian stepped closer, his breath warm against her ear. "You said you wanted to see snow. The petals falling that night were our first snowfall."

Her fingers trembled.

That secret evening—she remembered even the weight of petals on her shoulders.

"The mountain path behind Mount Rainier has no streetlights." He pressed her hand to his chest. "Turn right at the third fork, then navigate seven sharp curves."

Beneath her palm, his heartbeat was steady and strong.

Tears streamed down Stella's face.

That hidden trail didn't even appear on GPS. She'd searched for it countless times, always losing her way at the seventh bend.

"Shall we go now?" He wiped a tear from her cheek. "The road is dark and slippery—I'll carry you up."

Mr. Xavier coughed violently. "Adrian! Have you lost your mind?"

"I've never been clearer." Adrian wrapped an arm around Stella's shoulders. "From now on, anyone who touches her is my enemy."

Night wind carrying the sound of waves rushed into the room.

Grant stared at their joined hands, the silver engravings on his cane gleaming coldly.

Only when the red taillights vanished along the coastline did Mr. Xavier hurl an ashtray in fury. "How could he regain his memory now?!"

"Hypnosis always wears off eventually." Grant stroked the top of his cane. "I just didn't expect..."

Shards of glass reflected his sinister profile.

On the winding coastal road, Adrian drove with one hand, the other never leaving Stella's.

"Slow down at the third curve." His voice was quiet. "Last time, you sprained your ankle here."

She looked out at the dark pines.

Four years ago on a rainy night, Mr. Alistair had given the same warning. She'd been wearing ill-fitting heels, nearly tumbling into the ravine.

Moonlight traced Adrian's sharp jawline—a perfect match to the silhouette in her memories.

"Why..." Her voice broke. "Didn't you tell me sooner?"

The tires crunched over gravel as the car swayed. Suddenly, he turned the wheel sharply, parking at a cliffside overlook.

In the distance, a lighthouse beam swept across his deep-set eyes.

"Stella." He cradled her face. "For four years, I searched for you every single day."
###Chapter 341: The Relieving Truth

The prayer beads struck Grant Rubenstein's face, but he didn't even blink.

Sandalwood beads scattered across the floor, their crisp clatter echoing through the silent living room.

"Old Master, no amount of anger will change the facts." Grant picked up a bead with deliberate calm. "He's remembered everything—including the parts you wished he'd forget."

Mr. Xavier Atlante's veins bulged against the wheelchair armrests. "Impossible! After all the effort I—"

"You thought one car crash could erase his memories forever?" Grant scoffed. "He's far sharper now than four years ago."

"Then arrange another accident!"

"Last time worked because he was unprepared. Now he's surrounded by bodyguards." Grant shook his head. "Besides, Stella Valentine is now his lawful wife. Touch her if you dare."

Xavier slammed his fist on the armrest. "After all these years of raising you, this is your usefulness?"

"Who crippled my leg?" Grant's gaze turned venomous as he looked up. "Have some conscience, Old Master."

"Conscience?" Xavier sneered. "I only want the perfect heir!"

"Pity your 'perfect heir' now spends every waking moment plotting to escape you." Grant rose slowly. "There is another solution."

"Speak!"

"Replace him." Grant locked eyes with the old man. "With me."

"You?" Xavier laughed mockingly. "A cripple?"

Grant's expression darkened instantly. He turned toward the door, his uneven footsteps punctuating the silence.

"Stop! Who said you could leave?"

Without looking back, Grant waved dismissively. "You'll regret this, Old Master."

——

The ocean breeze slipped through the half-open car window, dispersing the heavy silence.

Stella's knuckles whitened around the hem of her dress.

"Here." Adrian Roland offered a handkerchief. "Your makeup's smudged."

She ignored it, staring at his sharp profile. "Was any of that true?"

"Do you want it to be true?" he countered.

"Answer me!"

His grip tightened on the steering wheel. "No."

"What?"

"I'm not Mr. Alistair." His voice was barely audible. "It was just... expedient."

Stella's breath hitched.

"Avoid going out alone recently." His tone remained steady. "I'll protect you both."

"Why..." Her voice trembled. "Why lie to me?"

"I didn't lie." Adrian braked abruptly, meeting her gaze. "I'm truly not him."

Streetlight shadows pooled in his eyes like spilled ink.

"Then how did you know about the sunrise at Mount Rainier? Or find the crabapple tree?"

"Because..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "I went there."

"When?"

"Last week." A whisper. "Alone."

Stella suddenly laughed, tears spilling. "Thank God you're not him."

"Hmm?"

"If you were Mr. Alistair..." She wiped her cheeks. "How could I ever face the Adrian who hurt me? Thank God you're not."

Adrian's hands clenched around the wheel.

"Also," she remembered, "Xavier wants you to inherit his empire?"

"Yes."

"But he needs Mr. Alistair as his heir..."

"So?"

Stella held his gaze. "So you're really not him. Right?"

The sea wind rushed in, extinguishing the last warmth between them.

"No," he said.
###Chapter 342: The Secret of Rose Garden

"Dr. Klein, my condition seems to have worsened."

Dr. Emily Klein forced her heavy eyelids open to look at the impeccably dressed man before her. His handsome face was indeed pleasing to the eye, but being woken at 4 AM filled her with resentment. She just wanted to end this consultation quickly.

She gulped down a mouthful of ice water, trying to shake off her drowsiness.

"Mr. Roland, this is an hour earlier than last time."

Adrian Roland slid a black card from his wallet and pushed it toward her. "Compensation."

"I'm almost fifty. No amount of money can buy back my beauty sleep." Dr. Klein sighed, rubbing her temples.

"I'll keep it brief." Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "I suspect I had a second personality."

Dr. Klein raised an eyebrow. "Go on."

"Those dreams—Mount Rainier, the crabapple tree—they all came true. I always thought it was twin telepathy. But now I'm certain... I never had a brother."

Dr. Klein suddenly perked up. "You're sure?"

"Absolutely." Adrian's knuckles whitened. "The woman I love met a man claiming to be my twin. Today, I confirmed that person never existed."

"So when she called me asking about shared twin memories..."

"Exactly." A spark of hope ignited in Adrian's eyes. "If that person was actually me..."

Dr. Klein's expression cleared. "She fell in love with your alternate personality?"

"I need confirmation." Adrian's voice tightened. "Under what circumstances would a second personality emerge?"

"Usually as a coping mechanism after severe trauma." Dr. Klein mused. "At the time, you..."

"Lost both parents. Lost the woman I loved. Was diagnosed with bipolar disorder."

Dr. Klein suddenly remembered something. "Have you seen a psychiatrist before?"

Adrian froze.

Dr. Lowell! And Uncle Xavier's warning!

His chest felt like it had been struck by a sledgehammer, stealing his breath.

"Mr. Roland?" Dr. Klein asked worriedly.

"I'm fine." He loosened his tie. "If that personality is gone..."

"I'm afraid she fell in love with someone who no longer exists."

"Is there any way to bring him back?"

"Triggering memory points might work." Dr. Klein suggested. "Mount Rainier and the crabapple tree held significance for him. They could awaken him."

......

Stella Valentine tossed and turned in the beach house.

Around 3 AM, she heard Adrian slip out silently.

Only two people could leave her side without a sound—Mr. Alistair, and Adrian.

She didn't ask.

Keeping her own secrets meant she had no right to question his whereabouts.

Besides, they were only married in name now.

Dawn was breaking when she finally drifted into uneasy sleep.

Vows beneath the crabapple tree. An embrace at the birthday banquet. Her floral sundress fluttering on the bicycle's rear seat...

Buzz—

Her phone vibrated, jolting her awake.

[Stella, I'm waiting at the Rose Garden.]

She sat bolt upright.

Rose Garden! Where she and Mr. Alistair shared their happiest memories!

Had he returned?

Or... had Adrian accessed those memories again?

Her hands trembled as she checked the sender—an unknown number.

Neither Adrian's nor Mr. Alistair's old number.

A second message followed:

[Our little Samoyed misses you. It's been keeping me company since you left.]
###Chapter 343 The Name You Gave Me, Of Course I Remember

Seven in the morning. The city was just waking up.

Stella Valentine stood before the rusted iron gate of the rose garden, her fingertips trembling slightly.

"Miss, this area isn't safe," the taxi driver warned through the rolled-down window. "I've heard homeless people have been sleeping here lately."

"Thank you. I won't stay long."

With a sigh, the driver pulled away.

Morning mist enveloped the dilapidated neighborhood like a forgotten corner of time. Peeling paint and overgrown weeds couldn't disguise the unchanged layout from four years ago.

She followed her memory to the apartment building.

Her phone vibrated.

[Are you there yet?]

[At the building now.]

The moment she hit send, rapid footsteps echoed from the stairwell.

A snow-white Samoyed dashed to her feet, circling her excitedly.

"He remembers you."

That deep voice sent shivers down her spine.

Black leather shoes crunched through dead leaves, stopping before her. Her gaze traveled up pressed slacks, an immaculate dress shirt, finally meeting amused eyes.

"Long time no see, Stella."

She bit her lip hard.

"I know you're angry." His hand lifted toward her face, then retreated. "I broke my promise."

Morning light gilded his silhouette like a dream.

"Are you Mr. Alistair or—"

"Does Adrian know about this place?" he countered.

"He would have your memories."

"And him?" He gestured to the dog nuzzling her leg. "Does the Roland family keep pets?"

Stella shook her head.

"But he remembers you." His voice softened. "Just like I do."

Tears blurred her vision.

"Why didn't you come find me?" Her voice shook. "Uncle Xavier said you died—"

A warm palm cupped her cheek.

"I had no choice." He brushed away her tears. "Give me time to explain?"

Stella stepped back. "Prove you're Mr. Alistair."

He arched an eyebrow. "How?"

"Your real name."

"Adrian Roland II." No hesitation. "The second Adrian."

Her heart skipped.

"What else?" she pressed. "That night under the crabapple tree—"

"Cloud Return." He whispered the name. "Like the moon returning to the west tower."

The dam broke.

He spread his arms. "Want to check for scars?"

Smooth palms faced upward. No marks on his neck either.

Not him.

This wasn't Adrian Roland.
###Chapter 344: Fragments of Memory

Dawn was breaking as Adrian Roland stepped out of Dr. Emily Klein's clinic.

The pre-spring morning air still carried a biting chill. He tightened his coat, letting the golden sunlight spill over his shoulders.

Dr. Klein's diagnosis was clear—the only way to confirm the existence of his second personality was to recreate the actions of that alter ego.

He stood by the roadside, fingers absently tracing the screen of his phone.

Stella Valentine's name glowed in his contacts.

In the end, he locked the screen.

If this was all just an illusion, why burden her with it? But if it were real...

Adrian clenched his fist sharply, the wounds on his palm sending a sharp jolt of pain. The sensation brought him an odd sense of relief.

"Hello?" Julian Valois' groggy voice came through the phone. "Do you know what time it is—"

"Sorry."

Julian cleared his throat. "What's wrong?"

"I'm Mr. Alistair, aren't I?"

A violent coughing fit erupted on the other end.

"You...remember?"

"Just deduction." Adrian's voice was eerily calm. "It's the only possibility."

Half an hour later, they met at a modest breakfast diner.

Julian eyed the greasy table with distaste, his suit jacket pulled tightly around him.

"Did we have to meet here?"

Adrian slid a bowl of soy milk toward him. "Try it? Stella used to love the custard buns here."

Julian pushed it away with a frown. "So you're here to..."

"Find memories." Adrian took a bite of the bun. "Dr. Klein said recreating scenarios might trigger them."

With a sigh, Julian gave a concise account of events.

"...That's all I know. As for what happened between you two—"

"I'm allergic to dairy." Adrian interrupted suddenly.

Julian's eyes widened. "Then why are you eating that?!"

"Forgot." Adrian stared at the half-eaten bun, fingers trembling slightly. "Only remembered halfway through."

"You..." Julian shook his head with a disbelieving laugh. "The great Adrian Roland, sitting in a roadside stall."

Adrian's lips twitched. "Doesn't matter anymore."

"Had an epiphany?"

"Yeah." He suddenly frowned. "Just now...I saw something."

"What?"

"Stella telling Mr. Alistair..." Adrian's voice caught. "That she'd never leave."

Julian leaned forward. "And then?"

As the second bun disappeared, Adrian pressed a hand to his chest.

"Allergic reaction?" Julian stood abruptly.

"Too soon for that." Adrian gave a pained smile. "Just...remembered the next part."

"That's good!"

"She said..." Adrian's voice dropped to a whisper. "As long as I wasn't Adrian Roland."

The air between them froze.

Julian opened his mouth, then closed it silently.

"Now I understand." Adrian's gaze fixed on the empty bowl. "Why you kept this from us."

Julian smiled bitterly. "Watching you at the birthday banquet...I thought time would heal everything."

"For her, the name 'Adrian Roland'..."

"Is an insurmountable wall." Julian finished quietly. "She could accept anyone being Mr. Alistair—except you."

In the morning light, the shadows of the two men stretched long across the ground.
###Chapter 345: I Am Mr. Alistair

Dawn light filtered through the window as steam rose from the soy milk.

Adrian Roland set down his cup, the porcelain clinking against the wooden table.

"I've told you everything." He exhaled deeply. "Keeping this secret all these years nearly drove me mad."

Julian Valois tapped his fingers against the tabletop, gaze fixed on the plane leaves drifting outside.

"I should've known." A faint smile curved his lips. "The way Stella looks at me... it never changed."

Julian shook his head with a wry chuckle. "You two always find your way back to each other."

"She was always mine." Adrian drained his soy milk in one gulp, determination flashing in his eyes as his throat worked.

"Going to see her now?"

"Not yet." He traced the rim of his cup. "First, I need to reclaim Mr. Alistair's memories."

Julian arched a brow. "How?"

"There's always a way." Adrian's gaze darkened. "Even if it comes at a cost."

When Julian stood to leave, sunlight gilded his shoulders. As the Valois heir, mountains of paperwork awaited him—along with a troublesome younger brother's messes.

"Good luck." He clapped Adrian's shoulder.

The soy milk shop owner approached, rubbing his hands. Adrian handed him a hundred-dollar bill.

"Sir, I don't have change—"

"Another order of custard buns." Adrian checked his watch. "I'm expecting company."

Half an hour later, Grant Rubenstein entered leaning on a cane.

"Had a change of heart, Mr. Roland?" He sat directly across, his cane thudding against the table.

Adrian glanced at the departing taxi. "Can't drive anymore, Grant?"

"Courtesy of Uncle Xavier." Grant bit into a custard bun. "Worth it, though."

"For your so-called 'perfect timing'?"

"Mutual benefit." Grant licked custard from his lip. "I can reunite you with Miss Valentine—"

"I am Mr. Alistair." Adrian's interruption sent the bun tumbling onto the table.

Grant's eyes narrowed. "Your memories returned?"

"No." Adrian unfastened his cufflink, revealing a vicious scar. "That's why I need your help."

The air turned glacial.

"Fascinating." Grant's low chuckle held no mirth. "You're right—this leg..." He rapped his cane sharply. "And that arm are both Xavier's handiwork."

Adrian rolled up his sleeve. "Do it again."

"You're insane?" Grant's pupils contracted. "That arm's recovery was already a miracle—"

"Worth it."

Grant leaned forward abruptly, voice dropping to a whisper. "Know something? I didn't even need to lift a finger last time—" His smile turned grotesque. "You broke it yourself."

The cane clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 346: You're Truly Ruthless to Yourself for Her

"You're willing to abandon Uncle Xavier's kindness just for Stella Valentine..."

Adrian Roland's eyes flickered. "So my arm was repayment to Uncle Xavier?"

Grant Rubenstein sneered. "What, you don't even want the strength to hold your wife and children anymore?"

"...Was it my choice?"

Grant stabbed his chopsticks into the custard bun. Golden filling dripped onto the white porcelain plate like congealed blood.

"Uncle Xavier said you could leave—but only after leaving an arm behind as payment."

Adrian's lashes trembled.

"Don't believe me?" Grant raised a brow. "No matter how much Uncle Xavier favored you, it could never outweigh Stella Valentine."

"Impossible..."

"Mr. Roland, do you know what I despise most about you?" Grant's laugh was icy. "Your indecisiveness. You collapsed after your parents died, making yourself an easy target. If it were me—"

"You don't understand." Adrian cut him off. "Back then, there was still—"

"Still your precious darling who ran away." Grant mocked. "Couldn't live without her?"

"No."

Grant froze.

"I used to think I could." Adrian's smile was bitter. "But I realized later—whether I hated her or loved her, my life was already tied to hers."

"What's so special about her?"

"If I knew why," Adrian gazed out the window, "there wouldn't be a 'Mr. Alistair' in the first place."

Grant's eyes darkened with malice. "What I'd kill to have, you threw away like trash."

"So you hate me?"

"I'm fucking jealous."

"And for that, Uncle Xavier broke your leg?"

"Exactly." Grant leaned on his cane as he stood. "Now we share the same goal—you want freedom, and I want you gone."

Adrian suddenly rose.

"Where are you going?"

"What did you use to hit me back then?"

"A steel baseball bat."

"Lead the way."

......

"Think carefully. One swing, and you'll either remember—or that hand will be truly useless."

Adrian hefted the weighty bat. "Similar to the one from back then?"

"Close enough." Grant took two steps back. "You sure about this?"

"Stand farther away." Adrian undid his cufflinks. "If my blood stains you, your other leg won't survive either."

"Save your concern." Grant smirked. "Uncle Xavier broke my leg for a different reason."

"What reason?"

"When you remember—"

Crash!

The car hood caved instantly. Blood sprayed across the paint like fireworks.

Adrian didn't flinch. Only the steady drip of blood from the bat broke the silence.

"...Remember now?"

Crash!

The second strike was fiercer. Grant's scalp prickled.

Crash!

After the third dull thud, a small pool of blood gathered on the ground.

"Brutal." Grant stared at the mangled arm. "All for a woman..."

Adrian turned, his shirt soaked with sweat. "What else?"

"What?"

"Important events from the 'Mr. Alistair' period." He panted. "Tell me everything."

Grant narrowed his eyes. "Trying to shock your memory back?" A sudden laugh. "There is one thing...but it'll cost you your life."

"Perfect for you, then."

"Uncle Xavier said the heir won't be you—and it won't be me either." Grant gritted his teeth. "Unless you hand it to me personally."

Adrian chuckled lowly. "Clever scheme."

"Learned from Uncle Xavier." Grant stepped closer. "He used your parents' deaths to tear you two apart, then played savior when you were at your lowest—"

"What did you say?" Adrian seized his collar. "Uncle Xavier was involved in my parents' accident?"

Grant's smile turned eerie. "Since when did Lily Savigny have the power to hide two cars for four years?"
###Chapter 347: Can You Just Believe Me This Once?

"...So Uncle Xavier was really the one..."

Grant Rubenstein sneered. "In all of Houston, who else could orchestrate such an elaborate scheme? Are you truly ignorant, or just unwilling to admit it?"

"..."

"Don't believe me? Fine, let me enlighten you—when you were still Mr. Alistair, you planned to abandon Adrian Roland's identity and elope with Stella Valentine under your alias. On your way to the airport, your car crashed—"

Adrian's pupils constricted sharply. "The accident that put me in a coma for months?"

"Precisely."

"It was Uncle Xavier..."

Grant's lips curled. "I was the one behind the wheel."

Adrian's head snapped up, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"Don't look at me like that. I merely followed Uncle Xavier's orders. He said it'd be best if you survived—with Stella gone, you'd have no choice but to serve him. And if you died... well, that would've been convenient too. As long as you drew breath, you'd never escape his grasp."

Adrian tilted his head back, eyes shut tight as his heart plunged into icy depths.

So this was the truth...

How utterly cruel...

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Uncle Xavier took me back, forced Stella to leave alone, and lied to her about my death?"

"Essentially, yes. Mr. Alistair did perish in that crash. Even if you smashed your arm to pieces, he wouldn't return." Grant shook his head in mock sympathy. "Pity you can't remember. Do you think Stella would believe you now if you told her you're Mr. Alistair?"

A phone suddenly rang.

Grant raised an eyebrow. "Your private line, Mr. Roland."

His left arm hung limp against the car hood as his right hand trembled, discarding the baseball bat to retrieve the phone from his inner pocket.

A star-shaped icon flashed onscreen—his special contact for Stella.

He took several deep breaths, forcibly suppressing the storm of emotions.

Answer.

"Hello?"

Chaotic noise and barking filled the line. "I have plans tonight. Don't wait up at the estate. Make something up if Grandpa asks."

His chest tightened. "Where are you?"

"...Rose Garden."

"That area's being demolished! It's dangerous! What are you doing there alone? I should—"

"Don't come!" Her voice turned urgent. "I'm... not alone. It's not a good time."

Something in her tone set off alarms. "Who's with you? Dr. Melford? Or Victor Valence?"

The only men who'd make her uncomfortable were those two.

But she'd denied involvement with both.

"Neither... It's personal. I'm safe. Goodbye."

"Wait—"

The line went dead.

Grant smirked. "Stella? Still holding a grudge?"

Adrian redialed with a frown.

One ring before disconnection.

He tried again—only to hear an automated voicemail prompt.

Grant's grin widened. "Blocked?"

Adrian snatched Grant's phone, rapidly punching in the memorized digits.

Ring—

Connected.

Stella's voice crackled with anger. "What more do you want?!"

"Little Star..."

She froze. "Adrian? Why are you calling from Grant's—"

"You blocked me?"

"...I need space."

"I'll respect that, but at least tell me who you're with. What should I tell Grandpa? What about the kids when they ask for Mommy?"

Long silence.

Finally, a sigh. "It's Mr. Alistair."

"Who?!"

"Mr. Alistair is back. Adrian, I'll play along until Grandpa leaves. After that... we're done."

"..."

"Adrian?"

"...I heard." His voice turned gravelly. "Are you certain... it's really him?"

"He brought our dog. Cotton recognized me immediately."

"..."

"He remembers the name I gave him."

"Is that so." Adrian stared at his mangled left arm with a bitter laugh. "Little Star, there's something you must know."

"Go on."

"I am Mr. Alistair."

"Have you lost your mind?! Should I call Dr. Klein for you?"

"I'm sane. I truly am him. The man with you is an impostor."

"Prove it."

"I..." He faltered.

"Mr. Alistair loves spicy food. You can't tolerate it."

"..."

"He remembers exactly which unit we lived in at Rose Garden. Do you?"

"..."

"Adrian, stop this."

He licked cracked lips. "Does this seem like a joke? Little Star, I am him. Just believe me this once, please?"

The raw plea made her breath catch.

Stella laughed bitterly. "I once begged just as desperately for you to believe the crash wasn't my fault. Did you believe me then?"
###Chapter 348: Have You Forgotten I Can't Drink Hot Water?

"So, this is my punishment?"

Stella Valentine's voice was calm as still water. "I don't want to dwell on the past. Please stop harassing me."

Adrian Roland's fingers tightened around his phone. "Fine. But I have one request."

"More proof that you're Mr. Alistair?" Stella sighed. "Just two days ago, you promised that if I played along with your charade, you wouldn't interfere when he comes back for me."

"Stella, I'm not interfering. Even though my memories aren't fully restored, all the evidence points to me being him! If you don't believe me, Grant Rubenstein can vouch—"

"Grant Rubenstein?" Stella let out a cold laugh. "He works for Mr. Xavier Atlante. I don't even trust you—why would I trust him?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Adrian, let's end this."

"...Promise me one thing."

"Go on."

"Don't block my number." His voice dropped low. "If you're ever in danger, call me immediately."

Stella's tone was firm. "Mr. Alistair would never hurt me."

"...Alright." His bitter chuckle echoed before the call disconnected.

A sharp pain pierced her chest.

She pressed a hand over her heart, waiting for it to fade.

"Stella, are you unwell?"

"I'm fine."

"Who upset you like this?"

"...Adrian Roland."

The man smirked, a shadow flickering in his eyes. "My long-lost brother. It's time we met."

Stella frowned. "You're dropping the disguise?"

"Thirty years is enough." He swirled his teacup absently. "As a Roland heir, I should pay my respects before Grandfather passes."

"Grandfather Edward has been in good health lately—"

He extended the cup. "Freshly brewed."

"Thank you." She accepted it but hesitated.

He took an elegant sip. "Just a final rally. The elderly all face this eventually."

Her chest constricted.

Setting the cup down, she said, "You can't blame Grandfather. They thought you'd died as an infant—"

"Stella," he cut in, "not all parents love their children. Their hearts were always biased."

"How would you know without spending time with them?"

"How do you know I haven't?"

She faltered.

"Mr. Alistair, you've changed."

He arched a brow. "Four years apart changes people."

A Samoyed nuzzled Stella's feet, licking her palm affectionately.

"Did you ever name him?"

"Dogs don't need names."

"What did you call him these years?"

"Dog." He sounded impatient. "Food and shelter are enough. Take me to the Roland estate tomorrow."

"Tomorrow? Celeste's surgery is—"

"Stella!" His voice sharpened. "Children grow up—that's inevitable. When can we go?"

She froze.

His indifference—toward the dog, the child, even her—felt alien.

Was it because of that letter?

"Mr. Alistair, I didn't mean what I wrote. Mr. Xavier Atlante forced me—"

"What letter?" He looked genuinely confused.

"He didn't show you?"

"No idea what you're talking about." He set the cup down roughly. "Give me a definite date. I'm tired of hiding like a clown."

"You're in a hurry?"

"Don't you want us to be together openly?" His laugh was cold. "First we could only meet at night. Now you want to wait longer?"

Stella studied him intently.

Abruptly, his expression softened. He clasped her hand. "I'm being too pushy. Stella, drink your tea before it cools."

Her gaze fell on the steaming cup.

"Mr. Alistair."

"Hmm?"

"...Have you forgotten I can't drink hot water?"
###Chapter 349: An Unfamiliar Presence

His expression froze for a split second.

Then he forced a smile. "How forgetful of me. Wait here—I'll get you an iced drink."

He picked up the steaming teacup and disappeared into the kitchen.

The sudden silence in the living room made Stella exhale in relief.

She glanced around. The once-cozy cottage was now a mess. A thick layer of dust coated the furniture—no one had been here for a long time.

The door still used the same old-fashioned key. She and Mr. Alistair had planned to install a fingerprint lock, but life got too busy.

She removed the key and placed it gently on the shoe rack.

The bedroom was empty. That double bed had witnessed countless nights of waiting. She always fell asleep first. He always arrived late and left before dawn.

Sometimes, the only proof of his visit was the wrinkled sheets.

Joy Fairsprene once joked that Mr. Alistair's ability to function on so little sleep was almost supernatural.

He carried too much. Handled too much.

Now this house, like Room 1231 at Houston Grand Hotel, would be demolished—erasing every trace of their past.

"Stella, here." He returned with a glass. "I rinsed it with ice water for a while."

Condensation dripped down the chilled surface.

She took a sip. "Thank you. It's perfect."

"Stay tonight?" he murmured.

Her lashes fluttered. "The children are still young, and Grandpa Edward—"

He suddenly closed the distance, trapping her between the wall and his arms. "It's been so long. Don't you... miss me?"

His warm breath against her skin sent chills down her spine.

"Stop..." She shoved him away.

"Playing hard to get?" He gripped her chin. "I thought I was your favorite."

His thumb stroked her cheek. She stiffened.

"Absence makes the heart grow fonder," he whispered before leaning in.

Stella flung the water in his face.

"Ah!"

Ice-cold droplets slid down his jaw. His gentle facade shattered, eyes darkening with fury. "Have you lost your mind?!"

"I'm sorry..." Her voice trembled. "Mr. Alistair, we need time—"

"Time?" He sneered. "You didn't need time when you were acting lovey-dovey with Adrian Roland!"

"That was different!"

"How?" He seized her wrist. "Or have you fallen for him?"

"I haven't!"

"Then why reject me?"

Stella lifted her gaze. "Because you've changed. Your tone, your demeanor, how you treat me... It's all different."

He scoffed. "People change."

"But I loved the Mr. Alistair from before." Her voice was barely audible. "The kind, patient one. If it's just about looks, Adrian has those too."

"You're comparing me to him?" His grip tightened. "After everything he did to you—"

"I haven't forgotten!" She wrenched free. "But Grandpa Edward is innocent. The children deserve a complete family—"

"What's that to you?" He smirked. "What did that old man ever give you? Money? Or—"

"Mr. Alistair!" She recoiled. "He's your grandfather!"

"Enough!" She seized the chance to escape. "We both need to cool off."

Outside, the midday sun blazed, yet she felt frozen to the core.

Perhaps the gentle Mr. Alistair had truly died in that car crash four years ago.

Her phone rang.

"Stella?" Joy's voice was urgent. "Are you still at Rose Garden?"

"How did you—"

"Julian sent me to get you!" Tires screeched in the background. "I see you!"

A red car skidded to a halt. Joy yanked her inside and sped away.

"Julian said you were in danger." Joy white-knuckled the steering wheel. "He told me to tell you something."

"What?"

"That man back there... wasn't Mr. Alistair."

Stella's pupils contracted.

"Julian witnessed everything between you and the real Mr. Alistair." Joy floored the accelerator. "We're going to see him now."
###Chapter 350: Shackles of Memory

The phone screen lit up.

That familiar number flashed.

Stella Valentine's finger hovered over the answer button, trembling slightly.

"Stella..." The voice on the other end sounded like it came from an abyss. "Come back."

She clenched the phone, her knuckles turning white.

The static amplified his ragged breathing, laced with desperate despair. "I've lost everything... I gave it all up to find you..."

"Calm down first," she said hoarsely.

"Calm down?" He suddenly laughed, the sound rough and broken. "Stella, if you leave, I'll jump from this window."

Her breath hitched.

"Remember to come collect my body." His tone softened eerily.

"Don't be stupid!" she nearly shouted. "What happened?"

"I was abandoned the day I was born." His voice grew quieter. "Parents, the world, everyone... until I met you. Now even you're leaving?"

Her heart constricted as if gripped by an invisible hand.

"Stella, you promised... as long as I wasn't Adrian Roland, you'd never leave."

Memories flooded back. "I remember," she whispered.

"Room 1231 at Houston Grand Hotel, the sunflower field, that 'snow' I made for you..." His voice faded. "And the proposal under the stars..."

Joy Fairsprene glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "Stella?"

"A woman?" The voice on the phone sharpened. "Who's with you?"

"...It's Joy."

"Joy Fairsprene?" His tone turned icy.

"She's picking me up." Stella took a deep breath. "Mr. Alistair, you need rest. Once Celeste's surgery is over, I'll come see you."

"Three days." His voice was steel. "Three days later, Rose Garden. If you don't show..."

A howling wind suddenly roared through the receiver.

Her blood ran cold.

"Hear that?" His voice drifted. "If you abandon me too, I'll jump. Free as the wind."

"Wait—"

The call ended.

Joy tightened her grip on the steering wheel. "That impostor?"

"Did Julian tell you?"

"Stella." Joy's expression darkened. "His timing is too perfect. Right after you and Adrian went public. I think he's here to ruin you."

Stella frowned. "But his face, his voice, even his memories..."

"That's what makes it terrifying."

The Valois Group headquarters stood empty.

Joy stamped her foot impatiently. "Where's Julian?"

The secretary trembled. "Mr. Roland is in trouble. Mr. Valois rushed over. He said to go straight to the Roland residence."

"Which one?"

"The... the house you and Mr. Roland shared before."

A black MV Agusta sat on the lawn.

Julian Valois waited in the living room, his face grim.

"What's going on?" Joy demanded.

Julian looked at Stella. "You should see Adrian first."

A sliver of light seeped from under the second-floor bedroom door.

She heard Adrian's muffled groan. "Remember... three days... Mount Rainier..."

"What about Mount Rainier?" She pushed the door open.

Adrian yanked the blanket up, his face pale. "Why are you back?"

The sharp scent of antiseptic hung in the air.

Bloodied cotton balls littered the floor.

She pulled the blanket aside—

"Don't!"

His left arm was wrapped in bloodstained bandages.

"What happened?"

"Minor injury." He forced a weak smile.

"He's lying." Julian stood in the doorway, his voice heavy. "The doctor said... the arm is useless now."

"What?"

"The first injury caused permanent damage." Julian closed his eyes briefly. "This time... the bones are shattered."
###Chapter 351: For Her Happiness, I'll Step Aside

Stella's mind went blank.

"Who did this?" Her voice trembled. "Mr. Xavier? Or someone else?"

Julian crossed his arms, brows furrowed. "Ask him yourself."

Adrian gave a faint smile and shook his head. "It doesn't matter. What's done is done. You're not going to fight them, are you?"

"Of course I am!" Stella said firmly. "Tell me who it was. I'll demand justice!"

"You—"

"I don't care who they are. How dare they do this to you? It's a crime! Even if they're powerful, I'll take them to court!"

Adrian chuckled softly and patted her hand with his right one. "Your words are enough. Go on. Don't keep him waiting."

"Adrian!" Julian cut in sharply.

"Enough." Adrian stopped him and turned back to Stella. "I promised you—if he returned, I'd let you go. I'll handle Grandfather. You... go to him."

Stella bit her lip. "But on the phone earlier, you said—"

"I'm sick, remember?" His voice was gentle. "You met him? Talked about the past?"

"...Yes."

"So you had a dog together? What breed?"

"Samoyed."

"Adorable." He asked softly, "Is he good to you?"

"..."

"Silly question. Of course he is." Adrian said, "Go. Don't waste time because of me."

Stella's heart was in turmoil.

Julian opened his mouth several times but stopped under Adrian's warning gaze.

"Celeste's surgery is soon," Stella finally said. "Mr. Alistair can wait. I need to be with her."

"Fair enough." He nudged her gently. "Go now, before I change my mind."

Stella hesitated. "You're really... not him?"

"If I were, would you forgive me? Stay?"

"I..."

"You hesitated." He smiled bitterly. "Don't worry. I'm not him. You'll never have to make that choice."

"..."

"Go."

Julian sighed. "Joy, take Ms. Valentine back to the estate."

Outside, Joy looked confused. "What's going on? Is that man really Mr. Alistair or not?"

Julian ushered them out and locked the door.

"Soundproof. No need to hold back now."

A muffled groan escaped Adrian's throat as he clutched his left arm, sweat pouring down his face.

Julian handed him a pill bottle. "Expired painkillers. Better than nothing."

Adrian dry-swallowed them.

"Slow down! You can't—"

Ten minutes later, the sharp pain dulled to an ache.

Julian frowned. "Why change your mind? She'd believe me."

"She hates me."

"She wouldn't if she knew you're him."

"Then she'd suffer more." Adrian's face was ashen. "How could she choose?"

"So you're giving up?"

"How do I prove it?" Adrian laughed bitterly. "I didn't even know about the dog."

"Not worried the impostor will hurt her?"

"If he fooled her, he must be convincing." Adrian analyzed. "Two motives: revenge or money."

Julian nodded. "Pulling this off takes resources."

"Which means... my brother might be alive."

"My thoughts exactly."

Adrian took a deep breath. "Then it's simple. By pretending to be Mr. Alistair, he wants both. He hates our family and me for inheriting everything."

"Your plan?"

"Get a lawyer. Transfer my assets to the kids." Adrian said. "For money, he'll treat them well."

"And you?"

"Me?" He glanced at his useless arm. "What right does a cripple have?"

"Then why stage the car crash? If you're giving up the identity, why risk recovering memories?"

Adrian was silent for a long moment.

"Because in those memories... I was happy."
###Chapter 352: Thoughts Under the Starlight

"Why wait three days?"

"I promised Celeste I'd take her to the amusement park. Her last wish before surgery. Victor could cause trouble anytime, and Stella can't handle it alone."

Julian raised an eyebrow. "Two days are enough. What about the third?"

"To meet Mr. Alistair."

"A duel?"

"Some questions need answers face-to-face."

......

The night was deep.

Stella tossed and turned in the wide bed, silk sheets crumpled beneath her.

She thought her restlessness came from seeing Mr. Alistair, but Adrian's pale face haunted her thoughts instead.

He leaned weakly against the headboard, his injured left arm hidden beneath the blankets.

Julian said that hand was useless now.

Outside, stars glittered, and a crescent moon hung in the sky.

Not a rainy day—no reason for old wounds to flare up.

At his current status, who could hurt him?

Stranger still, he hadn't sought revenge.

These questions tangled like vines, the more she thought, the more confused she became.

[Still awake?]

Her phone vibrated.

In the darkness, the screen glared brightly.

A second message followed: [Stella, I miss you.]

She stared at the screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard.

The reunion she'd once dreamed of daily, yet now she couldn't even type "I miss you too."

[The stars tonight are beautiful, like your eyes.]

[Will you come in three days?]

[I'll wait for you.]

Messages piled up.

She turned the phone off.

The bedroom sank into deeper silence.

By dawn, she gave up on sleep and switched on the nightlight.

The pillow beside her lay untouched.

When she first moved in, she'd resisted sharing a bed with Adrian.

Now, the empty space felt unsettling.

The realization made her rake frustrated fingers through her hair.

Could it be...?

No. Impossible.

She shook her head hard.

But her heart remained in turmoil.

Half-asleep, she dreamed Mr. Alistair had become Adrian.

Covered in blood, he gripped her hand tightly. "Don't leave me..."

Sunlight through the curtains woke her.

Muffled coughs came from downstairs.

She pulled back the curtains.

He stood in the garden, wearing that same black suit.

His left arm hung limp, his right hand wrapped in bandages.

To avoid David, he hadn't even gone to the hospital.

"Adrian," she called softly.

He looked up sharply, hiding his left arm behind his back.

"Did I wake you?" He forced a smile.

"What are you doing out here?"

"Walking. Ended up here without realizing."

"Why not come inside?"

"You were asleep." His voice was quiet. "The stars last night... were beautiful."

In the morning light, dark circles shadowed his eyes.

"Come in and rest."

He shook his head. "Mr. Alistair wouldn't like it."

"This is your house!"

"The stand-in should exit now." He kicked at fallen leaves, his smile bitter.
###Chapter 353: May I... Hold You?

Stella Valentine watched his solitary silhouette in silence, her heart aching with bittersweet sorrow.

"How bad are your injuries really?"

Adrian Roland maintained his composure. "Minor. Julian exaggerated."

"Have you been to the hospital?"

"..."

"Of course not. You're afraid William might notice your right hand and neck haven't healed."

"..."

"Wait here."

Stella hurried upstairs, retrieved the first aid kit with practiced ease, and returned quietly to the courtyard.

He still stood beneath her window. A sleek black MV Agusta Brutale gleamed nearby.

"Are you insane?" Her eyes widened. "Riding a motorcycle with both hands injured?"

Adrian chuckled. "It was just parked there. And really—" He hissed sharply when her fingers barely grazed his left arm.

"Hospital. Now."

"Your bandaging worked fine last time. Any gauze left?" He hesitated. "If it's inconvenient—"

"Adrian." Her voice turned steely. "Hospital."

"Not now..."

"Why not?" Stella's voice rose. "You've already announced our relationship at the banquet. William can target me anytime. Your injuries change nothing."

"...It's different."

"How?"

"Adrian Roland can't appear wounded." His voice dropped. "You'll understand soon."

"I don't want to understand!" She snapped. "We're going today unless you fancy being a one-armed hero."

Abandoning the medical kit, she marched toward the motorcycle.

"I'll drive you."

Adrian coughed violently as she mounted the bike. "You can ride?"

"No. So you'll have to teach me."

Recognizing her stubbornness, he sighed. "There's the Stella I remember."

"What?"

"The proud, willful Valentine heiress who argued ten points for every one of mine."

Her lips pressed tight. "Don't reminisce."

"Just... missed that fire."

"Less talking. Roads are empty now."

Finally relenting, Adrian positioned himself behind her, guiding her through the controls.

"Hold on tight." The engine roared to life.

"May I... hold you?"

"Unless you want to fall off."

His right arm encircled her waist with featherlight caution. Stella yanked it tighter. "Let's go."

Despite her inexperience, the bike moved with surprising steadiness.

The hospital lobby stood deserted. She darted between registration desks.

"Straight to the dressing room." Supporting him toward the clinic, she ignored his protests.

The doctor recoiled upon removing the bandages. "Should I call the police?"

"Just dress it."

"Reckless!" The physician glared. "Shattered bones! This delay—strip for disinfection!"

Adrian hesitated. "Can we roll the sleeve—"

"Your wife can assist."

"She's not—"

Stella was already unbuttoning his suit jacket. Beneath it, only empty space and bare skin.

Preparing instruments, the doctor muttered, "At least she's decisive. This will hurt."

Alcohol met raw flesh. Adrian's body locked rigid, sweat beading his forehead.

"Can you take it?"

"Y—" His answer became a muffled groan when her lips silenced his pain.
###Chapter 354: Consider It My Atonement

Adrian's body tensed instantly, frozen like a statue.

The doctor seized the opportunity, swiftly cleaning the dried blood clinging to his arm before efficiently stopping the bleeding and bandaging the wound.

"Done." The doctor tightened the gauze and exhaled deeply. "Now we can proceed with the cast."

Stella leaned back slightly, breaking their kiss.

Adrian remained stunned, the pain momentarily forgotten as he stared at her in disbelief.

His pupils weren't pure black but held an amber hue, clear yet profound. After the initial confusion, his eyes suddenly ignited with startling brilliance.

Stella turned her face away, wiping her lips with the back of her hand. "Doctor, will his arm recover?"

The doctor's expression darkened. "Comminuted elbow fracture with severe nerve and muscle damage... It's unlikely to fully heal."

"What about daily life?"

"It'll be challenging. But with you by his side, it'll be manageable." The doctor added meaningfully, "Especially with bathing and changing clothes—the wounds can't get wet. You'll need to assist him for the next three months."

Stella gave a vague acknowledgment and reached out to support him. "Let's go get the cast."

He obeyed, rising to his full height and instantly enveloping her in his shadow. As he stood, he staggered, and Stella hurried to steady him—only to realize she couldn't support his weight.

Adrian braced himself against the wall with his right hand, his lips twisting into a self-deprecating smile. "I can't even stand properly now."

"You're already remarkable," the doctor remarked. "Most people would've passed out from pain without anesthesia for such severe injuries."

"Worth it," Adrian murmured, his gaze lingering on Stella.

As they left the treatment room, Stella noticed his unsteady steps and the faint tremble in the arm she held.

The pain was finally consuming him.

"Do you want painkillers?"

"No."

"Why endure it?"

"Stella," he suddenly asked, "which hurts more—cancer or a broken arm?"

Her breath hitched.

"I haven't endured your suffering... Consider this my atonement."

"I told you I don't hate you anymore."

"But I'd rather you did." His voice was hoarse. "At least then, I'd still occupy a place in your heart."

"Adrian..."

"Three more days." He cut her off. "Take Celeste to the amusement park. See her into surgery. After that... I'll personally send you away."

His smile was tender yet shattered. "I want to watch you find happiness."

Stella finally voiced the question weighing on her: "Are you really Mr. Alistair?"

"No."

"But Julian said you are."

"He's my friend." Adrian replied calmly. "Only a handful know Mr. Alistair's identity: Julian, Charlie, Uncle Xavier, and Mr. Grant. Julian sides with me; Uncle Xavier sides with Mr. Alistair. Who do you believe?"

Stella shook her head in anguish. "The Mr. Alistair in the rose garden knew our past, but his personality was nothing like yours... Yet you..."

"What about me?"

"Lately... you've become more and more like him."

Adrian chuckled softly. "Because I've been imitating him. You once said you'd never leave Mr. Alistair—unless he turned out to be me."

He reached out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "So I'm not him. In three days, leave with peace of mind and chase your happiness."

"Patient for the cast!" a distant doctor called.

Adrian took a deep breath. "I'll go alone." He lowered his voice. "Don't let Mr. Alistair know about... the kiss."
###Chapter 355 She Was No Longer Herself

His silhouette looked unusually frail in the morning light.

Stella Valentine watched his retreating figure, her eyes suddenly burning. When had the man who once stood tall like a pine tree become so cautious?

Just days ago, he could effortlessly lift her. Now he could barely raise his arm.

Who had hurt him?

Why were both he and Julian Valois so tight-lipped about it?

Her phone vibrated, interrupting her thoughts.

[Stella, are you awake? Why haven’t you replied?]

Mr. Alistair’s message arrived right on schedule.

She checked the time—only seven o'clock.

[I’m awake.]

[Did you sleep well last night?]

[Yes.]

[You weren’t responding. I thought you regretted it.]

She took a deep breath. [We’ll talk when we meet in three days.]

The phone rang abruptly.

"Where are you?" Mr. Alistair’s voice carried an edge. "It doesn’t sound like you’re at home."

"The hospital." Her grip on the phone tightened instinctively.

"For the child’s surgery?"

"...Yes."

"Remember to meet me in three days." His tone suddenly turned eager. "We’ll return to the Roland estate together and take back what’s rightfully mine."

"What exactly?"

"The Roland empire!" His voice rose sharply. "With your shares added to mine, we’ll be the majority stakeholders. I’ll make Adrian Roland beg at our feet!"

Stella’s heart clenched. "Mr. Alistair, you’ve changed."

"People change." He scoffed. "Why should he have everything? This time, I’ll make him pay."

"I don’t want revenge."

"You will cooperate!" His voice turned vicious. "If you don’t show up in three days, don’t blame me for the consequences."

The call ended, leaving Stella chilled to the bone.

Was this really the man she once knew?

"So this is where you are."

Adrian’s voice came from behind her. His left arm was in a cast, yet he still managed to smile. "It’s time to pick up the kids."

At the family estate, the three children were having breakfast.

"Daddy!" Luna rushed over, standing on tiptoe to blow on his cast. "Pain, pain, go away!"

Ethan and Celeste joined in, their little faces solemn as if performing a sacred ritual.

"Daddy promises you," Adrian bent down to kiss Luna’s forehead, "I’ll get better soon."

Stella turned away.

Suddenly, she couldn’t tell who was lying anymore.
###Chapter 356: Get In, My Lady

"Adrian, are you sure you're alright?" Elder Roland frowned deeply, his gaze lingering on the bandages wrapping his grandson's arm.

Adrian gave a resigned smile. "Grandfather, it's just a scratch."

"I don't believe you." The old man turned to Stella, his tone softening instantly. "Stella, tell me the truth."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she avoided his concerned eyes. "The doctor said... he just needs rest."

"Good." Elder Roland exhaled in relief, his clouded eyes dimming. "This old man is useless now..."

"Grandfather!"

"Don't humor me." He waved a hand, studying them both. "When I'm gone, Adrian will only have you two left... Promise me you'll always take care of each other."

Stella clenched her skirt, nails digging into her palms.

Adrian smoothly intervened. "You're overthinking things. We still need you to babysit our three little troublemakers. We were just planning a date night."

The old man burst into laughter, crow's feet crinkling. "Go! With your blessing, I can rest easy..."

Benjamin chuckled nearby. "Master, they've been holding hands since they arrived."

Stella startled, realizing her hand had slipped into Adrian's elbow. She jerked away, ears burning. "He's injured... I was just—"

"Still as shy as ever." Benjamin's eyes twinkled. "Just like when you first started dating—claiming you were only siblings while clinging to his arm."

Memories flooded back—her younger self demanding Adrian's attention like a spoiled princess, only to become timid after they became a couple.

"Benjamin!" Adrian coughed, his ears reddening.

"Alright, I'll stop." The butler's smile faded. "If only Madam Roland and Mr. Valentine... could have seen this..."

Silence fell over the room.

Adrian broke it. "We're taking the children to the amusement park."

"Go on." The elder nodded, then fretted. "Mind your arm."

"Daddy's taking us!" Celeste bounced, pigtails swinging. "Now no one can say I don't have a daddy!"

Stella's heart ached as she scooped up her daughter. "Who said that? Your daddy is handsomer than all of theirs."

"Exactly!" Celeste lifted her chin proudly, reaching for Adrian. "Carry me!"

"Don't be difficult." Stella frowned. "Your father's hurt."

Adrian already hoisted the girl one-handed, smirking. "If I can carry you, Celeste is nothing." He turned. "Ethan, protect Mommy and Luna."

"Sir!" The boy puffed his chest, grasping Luna's hand and Stella's. "I'll guard everyone today!"

Luna mumbled through a mouthful of cookies. "Mhm!"

Stella's eyes stung as she ruffled Ethan's hair. "Our little knight is so dependable."

Sunlight stretched their silhouettes across the floor. Benjamin watched them leave, murmuring, "Master, are you at peace now?"

Elder Roland wiped his eyes. "These children... they've suffered too much..."

By the SUV, Stella fastened seatbelts on three squirming children, sweat glistening on her forehead.

"Stella."

She turned. Adrian stood by the passenger door, his right hand shielding the car's roof. Sunlight gilded his profile, softening his sharp features.

"Get in, my lady."
###Chapter 357: Mr. Alistair Is Mr. Alistair, I Am Me

"What did you say?" Stella Valentine's eyes widened slightly.

Adrian Roland tapped his long fingers against the steering wheel. "I remember someone saying a man's passenger seat is reserved only for his wife."

Stella fell silent.

"The amusement park gets crowded on weekends. Any later and we'll be stuck in long lines." His tone was calm but firm.

She bit her lip and finally slid into the passenger seat.

He leaned over to fasten her seatbelt, his crisp scent enveloping her. The motion was so quick that by the time she registered it, he had already returned to the driver's seat.

"Are you wearing cologne?" Stella couldn't help asking.

"No." Adrian started the car. "I've been at the hospital since last night. Hardly the time for that."

Stella sniffed her sleeve, catching only the faint scent of laundry detergent.

"Perhaps it's Mr. Alistair's scent." His voice was measured. "You met yesterday..."

"What?"

"After such a long separation, you must have been... close." His grip tightened on the wheel as he stared straight ahead. "Hugging. Holding hands. Or—"

"Nothing happened." Stella cut him off. "We didn't do anything."

His fingers flexed against the leather. "Is that so?"

"Disappointed?" She turned to study his profile. "Or were you hoping something did happen between us?"

He avoided her gaze. "It's not my place to interfere."

"Adrian." Stella drew a steadying breath. "One last time—are you sure you're not Mr. Alistair?"

The car plunged into suffocating silence.

"You want the truth?" His voice dropped low. "Even if it destroys you?"

She nodded.

"Then promise me you'll stay by my side forever."

Stella said nothing.

"See? That's your answer." A humorless smile touched his lips. "Mr. Alistair returned with the dog you raised together. Isn't that proof enough?"

"But I feel—"

"Today is for the children." He cut her off gently. "Let's make it happy, alright?"

Excited chatter bubbled from the backseat.

"Remember this—Mr. Alistair is Mr. Alistair." His final words hung in the air. "I am me. That's the reality."

The amusement park entrance swarmed with visitors.

Adrian parked and turned to them. "Wait here. I'll get the tickets."

"Don't worry, Dad!" Ethan puffed out his chest. "I'll protect Mom and my sisters."

Adrian ruffled his son's hair before striding toward the ticket booth.

The children whooped with joy when they received their passes, dashing into the park. Stella moved to follow, but Adrian caught her wrist.

"Let them play." His voice was quiet. "Penny will keep an eye on them."

"Penny? Your secretary?" Stella arched a brow.

He emphasized deliberately: "Yes. My female secretary."

She huffed. "She has a boyfriend. She's only working for you to save money for her trip to the border."

"I know." His expression remained neutral. "That's why I'm docking half her salary."

"What? You're trying to break them up?"

Adrian shook his head. "Her boyfriend is gone."

"What?"

"Killed on duty two years ago." His voice softened. "At border stations, it's tradition for comrades to keep sending letters to fallen soldiers' families."

Stella covered her mouth.

"The man who took over writing to her... also died." He continued quietly. "His phone was lost. The letters stopped."

Her eyes glistened.

"Cutting her pay is to delay her." He sighed. "With time... maybe she'll heal."

Stella stood speechless.

"Little Star." Adrian gazed at the distant Ferris wheel. "Every day, people lose loved ones. Go to him in three days."

She looked up sharply.

"These three days—let them be our farewell." Sunlight etched the sharp lines of his profile.
###Chapter 358: Cloud and Thunder

Countdowns always make time feel more precious.

Like the seven days waiting for a pregnancy test result. Like now.

Three days remained. The first day was spent fulfilling the children's dreams at the amusement park. The second day, accompanying Celeste into the operating room.

And the final day?

Stella looked up at him.

His left arm was in a cast, slung across his chest. His right hand rested casually in his pocket. His posture was straight, his gaze tender as he watched the scene ahead.

By the carousel, the three children buzzed like excited bees, choosing their favorite horses. Ethan, the eldest, carefully helped his sisters onto their mounts before climbing onto the tallest chestnut steed. Noticing his parents' attention, he waved enthusiastically.

Little Celeste, the youngest, had Penny sitting protectively behind her. From afar, Penny gave Stella a reassuring thumbs-up.

The music began—an English rendition of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."

"Twinkle twinkle little star..."

"Little star..."

His voice dissolved into the cheerful melody.

"Hmm?"

"I'm sorry."

"What?"

"Truly sorry..."

"Sir, ma'am, would you like to buy balloons for the kids?" A jester-clad vendor appeared, clutching a bouquet of cartoon balloons.

Adrian asked, "Do you have Iron Man?"

"Yes, of course..."

He shoved his wallet into Stella's hands. "Help me pay."

Before she could react, he'd already selected several balloons and even picked out cat-ear headbands for the girls.

"That'll be fifty-three yuan," the jester said with a smile.

As Stella reached for her phone to scan the payment, Adrian interjected, "Pick a few more."

"We already have three."

"Which one do you like?" His eyes skimmed the colorful array. "I remember you loved the Powerpuff Girls."

Stella's ears warmed. That cartoon was from so long ago.

The jester eagerly suggested, "This moon balloon is very popular."

"Do you have stars?"

"We have stars, moons, and even suns!"

"One of each," Adrian said.

After collecting the celestial trio, Stella pointed to a fluffy cloud balloon. "Add this one too."

As the jester handed over the balloons, he whispered conspiratorially, "Make sure to ride the Ferris wheel tonight. The night view is breathtaking."

"Yes, especially beautiful," Adrian murmured in agreement before dismissing the vendor.

The carousel slowed to a stop, and the children dashed toward costumed characters. Penny crouched to snap photos.

"Cloud..." Adrian studied the balloon. "Does 'Adrian' mean cloud?"

"This is for you." Stella lifted the cloud balloon. "Look, there's a tiny lightning bolt on it. Cloud and thunder—that's you."

He stared at the balloon, the corner of his mouth lifting. "There is lightning."

"I spotted it immediately."

"Thank you." His voice was low. "I love it."

The gratitude felt too solemn. Stella averted her gaze. Ethan was waving at them from a distance. She hurried over. "The kids are calling us."

The balloons swayed in her grip as Adrian easily caught up. When a miniature train passed by, he pulled her back. "Careful." His brow furrowed. "What will you do when I'm not here to watch over you?"

Once the train passed, he strode ahead, his back straight and tall.

"Mom! Dad!" The children rushed toward them.

Penny raised her camera. "How about a family photo?"

"Yes!" Ethan bounced excitedly. "We've never taken one before!"

Adrian glanced at Stella. She nodded. "Let's do it."

"Mr. Roland, hold Luna. Mrs. Roland, take Celeste. Ethan, stand in the middle..."

Click—

Happiness crystallized in that moment.
###Chapter 359: You Are My Beloved

The laughter from the amusement park faded into the distance as twilight enveloped the grounds.

Stars dotted the night sky, and the pale moonlight glinted softly off the metal frame of the Ferris wheel.

In the line, Celeste was already fast asleep on Penny's shoulder, while Luna yawned drowsily in her brother's arms.

Ethan straightened his back to make his sister more comfortable, though exhaustion weighed heavily on him. He still stubbornly remained her support.

The boy was growing more like his father every day.

Stella gazed at her son's profile and, for a fleeting moment, saw the youthful features of Adrian Roland.

That once-bold young man now carried only quiet composure in his expression.

"Stella."

Adrian's voice pulled her back to the present. He held the family photo Penny had just taken, his fingers lightly tracing its edges.

"See? I've aged."

The man in the photo smiled, but sorrow lingered in his eyes.

Penny leaned in teasingly. "Mr. Roland, with such a young and beautiful wife, you'd better take care of yourself!"

"As long as she's happy, it doesn't matter who she's with," Adrian replied calmly.

Penny's eyes widened instantly. "Mr. Roland, are you—"

"Don't say nonsense, Penny!" Ethan immediately stepped between his parents. "Mom and Dad will never separate!"

"Yeah!" Luna waved her tiny fists in agreement.

Penny quickly backtracked. "Kids say the darndest things!"

"Your performance bonus is docked this month." Adrian didn't even lift his gaze.

"What?!" Penny nearly jumped. "Mr. Roland, you can't do this! I can barely afford rent this month!"

"Keep arguing, and it'll be double."

Penny immediately fell silent, casting a pitiful look at Stella.

Stella pulled a bill from her wallet. "Go get something to eat."

Watching Penny's dejected retreat, Stella sighed. "Now she probably thinks we're both stingy."

"Some truths are better left unknown." Adrian stared at the distant Ferris wheel. "Time will fade everything. Even if she hates me, it doesn’t matter."

"Do you have to torture yourself like this?" Stella frowned. "I told you I don’t hate you anymore."

Adrian didn’t answer. Instead, he asked, "Did you ride this Ferris wheel with Mr. Alistair?"

"Yes."

"Did he propose at the top?"

Stella's fingers trembled slightly. "...He did."

"I knew it." Adrian smiled faintly. "He would do something like that."

The Ferris wheel began its slow rotation, and the attendant urged them to board.

Adrian guided Stella into the cabin. As they ascended, the city lights spread beneath them like a glittering tapestry.

When they reached the peak, Adrian closed his eyes and whispered:

"May the breeze guide your path,
May the stars light your way home.
Even if time changes your face,
Even if you forget me,
You will always be my beloved."

The night wind carried his words away, dissolving them into the starlight.
###Chapter 360: Never Look Back

The Ferris wheel rotated slowly, its thirty-minute journey nearing completion.

Twilight enveloped the sky, the deep blue canvas splattered with stars, silently composing the night's symphony.

Silence stretched between them in the cramped cabin, heavy with unspoken finality. They gazed at the constellations in wordless harmony until the ride completed its final revolution and settled onto solid ground.

Adrian turned to offer his arm, but Stella subtly sidestepped his gesture.

"Your injury hasn't healed. I can manage."

Was it genuine concern for his wound, or reluctance to accept his touch? The ghost of a smile touched Adrian's lips. The answer no longer mattered.

Nearby, Penny resembled a Christmas tree overloaded with plush toys. Celeste slept koala-like against her shoulder while Luna nestled close, cheeks flushed with sleep. Ethan, ever the responsible eldest, clutched a bouquet of balloons and swatted mosquitoes away from his sisters with chubby fingers.

"Mr. Roland, Mrs. Roland—" Penny's voice cracked with relief at their approach.

Stella immediately took the children, guilt softening her tone. "Thank you for watching them."

Rubbing her numb arms, Penny groaned, "Babysitting is worse than overtime. At least overtime pays extra..."

She peeked at Adrian, hoping for a bonus. He merely adjusted Luna in his arms, deaf to the hint.

Undeterred, Penny shot Stella a pleading look. Stella averted her eyes, hardening her heart.

"So unfair!" Penny wailed. "I'm the one who helped you two reconcile!"

Stella exhaled softly. Adrian's tactic was ruthless but effective. Penny saved relentlessly for her边疆 trip, oblivious to the heartbreak awaiting her there.

That particular pain—Stella knew it intimately.

Like carving out a piece of your soul, leaving a wound that never truly heals. Compared to that, docked wages were insignificant.

"Little Star, don't look back."

His voice startled her.

"I'm not," she murmured.

"Do what you believe is right. Let your conscience be clear. Never look back."

"...Alright."

Night deepened.

After tucking in the children, Stella retreated to their bedroom. Adrian remained in his study, buried in work. She stood by the window, dialing Dr. Melford's number.

Tomorrow was Celeste's surgery.

The call wouldn't connect. Had he blocked her? Or was he in surgery?

She set down the phone and prepared for bed.

Dawn's first light found her awake. The bedsheets beside her lay undisturbed—Adrian hadn't returned all night.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Miss Valentine, apologies—I was in surgery yesterday." Dr. Melford's voice carried through. "The procedure's today? Shall I come?"

"No need to trouble—"

"Which hospital? I'll head over now."

The line disconnected before she could refuse.

Stella frowned. How would she explain the doctor's presence to Adrian? He'd witnessed Dr. Melford's overtures during that dating show.

But the surgery came first.

She dressed hurriedly. Old Benjamin informed her, "Young Master left at dawn. Said to go straight to the hospital."

At the medical center, Celeste was scheduled as the first case.

"Mommy...what if I don't wake up?" The child's eyes glistened.

Stella kissed her forehead. "You will. It's just a nap. Daddy and I will be here when you open your eyes."

"Where's Daddy?" Celeste scanned the room. "I want to see him..."

"He's coming soon."

"Mommy, I have a secret to tell you after."

Before Stella could respond, Celeste's face lit up. "Daddy's here!"

She turned and saw him—the familiar silhouette in the doorway.
###Chapter 361: Secrets and Crisis

"Ms. Valentine, apologies for keeping you waiting."

Dr. Melford arrived in haste, his tall frame accentuated by the black suit. The way he adjusted his tie was uncannily similar to Adrian's.

Stella gave a slight nod. "Thank you for making time, Dr. Melford."

"My pleasure." His gaze softened. "A major surgery like this—how could you handle it alone?"

Celeste immediately clung to Stella's leg. "My daddy's coming soon!"

Dr. Melford arched a brow. "Mr. Roland is attending today?"

Stella checked her watch. "He promised he would. Traffic must be holding him up."

"Successful men are always at the mercy of their schedules." Dr. Melford sighed. "Rather than waiting for someone perpetually absent, it's better to find someone who can always be by your side."

Celeste stomped her foot in outrage. "Don't say bad things about my daddy!"

"Celeste!" Stella quickly intervened.

Dr. Melford remained unfazed. "Children don't understand the complexities of adulthood."

"She doesn't need to."

A cold, deep voice cut through the air. Adrian strode forward, his suit jacket draped over his arm, his tie loosely hanging around his neck.

Dr. Melford instinctively took half a step back. "Mr. Roland..."

"Are you that idle, Dr. Melford?" Adrian positioned himself protectively in front of Stella. "As I recall, you're neither the lead surgeon nor employed at this hospital."

Celeste threw herself into her father's arms. "Daddy! This uncle wants to take Mommy away!"

Dr. Melford met Adrian's gaze evenly. "A single woman has the right to be pursued."

Adrian's lips curled into a smirk. "Seems you've been too busy to check the news lately."

"What do you mean?"

"Take a look at this morning's finance section." Adrian turned to Stella, his voice gentling. "Victor tried to flee. I intercepted him."

Stella's pupils contracted. "He went back on his word?"

"The agreement is legally binding. He has no choice." Adrian wrapped an arm around her shoulders. "It's time to take Celeste to the OR."

Stella glanced back to thank Dr. Melford, but Adrian firmly guided her away.

"His outfit today was too deliberate," Adrian murmured. "Someone's orchestrating his approach to you."

A chill ran down Stella's spine. "Who would do that?"

"Whoever it is," Adrian's eyes sharpened, "they won't lay a finger on you."

At the OR entrance, a nurse stood waiting.

Celeste suddenly burst into tears. "Daddy, I'm scared..."

Adrian knelt on one knee, meeting her eye level. "I promise you'll see me the moment you wake up."

"Pinky swear!" Celeste hooked her tiny finger with his. "I have a secret to tell you... after I come out."

"Deal. I'll be waiting to hear it."

As their daughter was carried into the OR, Stella clenched the hem of her shirt.

"Eight hours, and she'll be back with us." Adrian enveloped her icy hand in his. "I've arranged for the best medical team."

Stella stared at the sealed OR doors. "Sometimes I wonder... if that other child had survived..."

Adrian's arm tensed, pulling her closer. At the far end of the corridor, Dr. Melford stood shrouded in shadows, the eerie blue glow of his phone screen illuminating his face.
###Chapter 362 He's Not Worthy to Be My Threat

He knew she was referring to their unborn child.

That child had been his flesh and blood too.

"Did you give her a name?" Adrian's voice was low.

"Celeste. Like the stars." Stella's nose tinged pink as she forced a faint smile, but her eyes brimmed with shattered sorrow.

Only then did Adrian understand—Celeste was meant to be their daughter's name.

Fate had cruelly denied that little angel a chance at life. And now this child had entered Stella's world during her darkest hour.

This girl's biological father was a despicable man, and her mother had heartlessly abandoned her. On the very day their Celeste was lost, this child had found Stella.

That was why she clung so desperately to adopting her.

Celeste—sun, moon, and stars.

How perfect it would have been, paired with clouds and thunder.

But that chance was gone forever.

"That child will return to you," Adrian murmured. "She'll find her way back."

Stella gave a bitter laugh. "I hope so."

"You and Mr. Alistair... will you have children?"

"I don't know. We'll let nature take its course."

Adrian nodded silently.

The irony was unbearable. He could strategize business empires, yet failed to grasp life's simplest truth—love between a man and woman naturally begets new life.

His little star would become another man's wife.

The thought constricted his chest. He clenched his fists, forcing composure. This was for the best—no more tormenting her.

If she discovered Mr. Alistair's true identity, what choice would she have?

Better to preserve her illusions than shatter them. As long as that so-called "brother" treated her and the children well for the money's sake.

Eight hours—a standard workday or night's sleep for most.

But in the surgical ward's waiting area, each second stretched into eternity.

The first few hours were bearable. By the end, Stella paced the hallway like a caged animal.

As dusk fell, the operating light finally dimmed.

"Parents of Celeste Roland?" The surgeon emerged.

"I'm her mother!"

"The surgery was successful. She'll need several days in sterile observation—no visitors yet. If stable in three days, she can transfer to a regular room."

Stella's tension dissolved. Her legs buckled, collapsing onto a bench.

"There's paperwork to complete—"

"I'll handle it." Adrian stepped forward. "Let my wife rest. I'm her father."

The doctor nodded. "This way."

In the office, forms were presented. "The child has no domestic registration. We need parental details."

Adrian accepted the pen.

Basic information filled the page.

After his section, he documented Stella's particulars.

"The child takes her mother's surname?" The doctor seemed surprised.

"Yes. It's a lovelier name." His tone was flat.

"Celeste is unique. Please include blood types."

Adrian listed his Type O and Stella's Type A.

"Review for accuracy."

The physician's brow furrowed. "Mr. Roland, you're certain? You're Type O, your wife Type A, but the child is Type B—"

"She's adopted." Adrian clipped.

"Adoption paperwork?"

"Pending. My wife found her abandoned."

Understanding dawned. "I see."

"She believes I'm her biological father. Post-surgery, discretion is appreciated."

"Of course." The doctor nodded. "But formalize the adoption soon—school enrollment requires it."

"Naturally. Thank you."

Exiting, Adrian headed straight for observation.

Rounding the corridor, he found Stella pressed against the glass wall, palms flat, gaze fixed inside.

"Little star." His voice was soft.

She startled. "Finished?"

"Yes. Celeste will recover."

Relief softened Stella's features. "Thank you. You had no obligation—she isn't blood—"

"Let it go."

"Victor Lefèvre... be careful. He nurses grudges. I fear retaliation."

Adrian smirked. "He's not worthy to be my threat."

Realization struck her. In his current position, Victor couldn't breach his orbit.

"Still... thank you." She bowed deeply, lingering.

"Little star..." A sigh escaped him. "Who could have predicted this?"

From love to hatred, from release to this strained civility. How cruel fate's mockery.
###Chapter 363 Good Afternoon, My Dear Brother

The scenery outside the car window blurred past. Stella Valentine studied Adrian Roland's tense profile and asked softly, "There's only one day left of our three-day agreement. What are your plans for tomorrow?"

His fingers tightened slightly on the steering wheel. "I have personal matters to attend to tomorrow. Penny Anderson will help you pack."

Stella's smile froze. "...Alright."

"Rose Garden is scheduled for demolition. I've instructed Penny to move your belongings to Room 1231 at Houston Grand Hotel first." He paused. "Once you're settled, I'll arrange for them to be delivered."

"There's no need to rush. Grandpa Edward—"

"Stella," he interrupted gently, "just focus on your own happiness."

"But what about you and Grandpa—"

"I'll handle it."

Silence filled the car. Stella turned to gaze out the window without another word.

The Roland family estate glowed with warm lights, children's laughter carrying through the air.

"Blood pressure at 120/80!" Benjamin Langley announced cheerfully, holding up the monitor. "Sir, your readings keep improving!"

Ethan and Luna tumbled through a pile of toys like energetic bunnies. Grandpa Edward's eyes crinkled with joy. "With these two little angels around, any illness would disappear!"

"Great-grandpa!" Ethan bounded over, eyes sparkling. "When I grow up, I'll fly you around the world in my airplane!"

"I'll hold you to that!"

Luna toddled closer, her voice sweet and milky. "I'll bake you the yummiest cake ever!"

Grandpa Edward's beard quivered with laughter. "Such wonderful children. Your mother raised you so well—"

Noticing Adrian and Stella's return, the old man immediately looked at them questioningly.

"The surgery was successful," Adrian reassured him. "He'll be transferred to a regular room in three days."

"Wonderful!" Benjamin sighed in relief. "Sir, you see? Everything's getting better."

Stella watched as the children swarmed Adrian, covering his shirt in colorful marker stains while he played along without complaint. A faint smile touched her lips.

Late that night, Stella lay in bed scrolling through her phone. A series of messages from Mr. Alistair appeared:

[Stella, tomorrow's the final day]
[When will you come? Tomorrow night or the day after?]
[Tomorrow night, alright? I want to fall asleep holding you]
[I miss you so much it hurts...]

Frowning, she typed: [Tomorrow night. I'll be at Room 1231, Houston Grand Hotel]

Setting the phone aside, she soon drifted into sleep.

At that same moment, two text messages arrived simultaneously—one from Stella, the other from an unknown number:

[7 AM tomorrow. Mount Rainier summit. —Adrian Roland]

In a Rose Garden apartment, "Mr. Alistair" smirked coldly as he snapped his phone shut.

Dawn broke over Mount Rainier's peak.

"Good afternoon, my dear brother."

Adrian turned. Despite his preparations, his pupils contracted sharply at the sight before him.

An identical face. An identical build. The only differences were the stranger's uninjured left arm and Adrian's own right arm encased in plaster.

"Surprised?" The man's lips curved. "Never imagined there was another me in this world?"

Adrian quickly regained composure. "All these years... why didn't you come home?"

"Home?" A bitter laugh. "When the Rolands abandoned me, did they ever consider me their child?"

"Then why return now?"

"To reclaim what's mine." He adjusted his cuff casually. "Half the Roland fortune belongs to me."

Adrian's gaze sharpened. "So you approached Stella—"

"Stella?" He savored the name. "So that's what you call her. I'll adopt that too."

Though their faces mirrored each other, their contrasting auras made them seem like entirely different people.

"State your terms," Adrian said evenly. "You want the family assets? I'll give them to you—on one condition."

The man arched a brow. "I intend to take everything..."

"I know. That's why you orchestrated this with Stella."

"Clever." A slow clap. "You'd really surrender it all?"

"I only have one condition."

"Ah, here comes the catch." A derisive snort. "How much are you keeping? Five million? Shares? The estate?"

"Take it all."

"Then you—"

Adrian lowered his eyes, his voice nearly lost to the mountain wind.

"...She cries easily. Don't make her sad."
###Chapter 364: Don't You Dare Touch Her!

"Huh?" He scoffed, eyes brimming with mockery. "Have you lost your mind?"

Adrian Roland stood at the cliff's edge, the mountain wind howling around him. His shirt clung to his gaunt frame like a second skin, making him resemble a reed about to snap.

"She's afraid of thunder. You must stay with her during storms, even if you're working."

"..."

"She has low blood sugar. It flares up in summer—always carry candy."

"..."

"Half of her lung was removed. Never smoke around her. If you must, go outside and air out completely."

Vincent Atlante dug at his ear impatiently. "Are you fucking done?"

Adrian ignored him. "She likes lavender and hates ginger. Gifts with star patterns are best."

"Damn it!" Vincent kicked a pebble violently. "What am I, her nanny?"

"What's your name?"

"Vincent Atlante." His lips curled into a grin. "Impressive, right? Soon I'll take the Roland name. How fucking tragic."

Adrian's gaze darkened. "Do as you please. Just don't let her realize you're not Mr. Alistair."

"Oh, playing the devoted lover now?" Vincent clapped sarcastically. "Go on, I'm listening."

"The passenger seat is hers alone." Adrian unlocked his phone. "This is a map of Mount Rainier's back trails."

Vincent glanced at the screen. "Treasure hunt?"

"There's a crabapple tree. When she wants to visit, follow this route."

"How thoughtful." Vincent wiped imaginary tears. "I'm moved."

Adrian pointed north. "Fifteen steps that way. Your son is buried there."

Vincent's smile froze.

"Your third child. Stillborn." Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "Visit with her... as his father."

"I won't remember!" Vincent suddenly roared. "Stop with this deathbed bullshit!"

"Then tattoo it on your skin!" Adrian yanked him by the collar. "If you mistreat her, I'll make you beg for death!"

Vincent licked his teeth. "Giving up New Frontier Group?"

"It can rot with my corpse."

"Madman!" Vincent shoved him away. "For a woman? Worth it?"

"I owe her." Adrian's voice was gravel. "If you harm a single hair—"

"What? Kill me?" Vincent leaned in. "What if I take her to bed? Knock her up?"

Adrian's knuckles cracked.

"The kid won't be a Roland." Vincent smirked. "Too dirty for my blood."

"Shut your mouth!"

Vincent clapped excitedly. "Finally some fire! That's more like it!"

His expression twisted with hatred. "Know how old I was when sold to that mountain village? Five! Licking boots for pennies! Every Roland deserves to die!"

"Father and mother didn't know you survived—"

"That's why they're dead!" Vincent laughed wildly. "Now it's your turn! I'll make you watch as I—"

CRACK!

Adrian's fist sent him sprawling. "You're dead!"

Vincent spat blood, grinning. "Go ahead. Kill me. Would you doom her to widowhood?"

He wiped his mouth slowly. "I'll be sure to... cherish her. Every. Single. Night."
###Chapter 365: Please Don't Expose Me

The final day of the three-day deadline arrived. Adrian Roland's mansion felt unusually empty.

Stella Valentine stood in the center of the bedroom, her fingers absently tracing the handle of her suitcase. Though it was just a temporary separation, an inexplicable sense of finality lingered in the air.

"Mrs. Roland, are you really leaving?" Penny Anderson peeked out from the walk-in closet, clutching her sketchpad. "The boss has been treating you well lately."

Stella pressed her lips together and folded a cashmere sweater into the suitcase.

"Rich people are so dramatic," Penny huffed. "Unlike my deadbeat ex who vanished for two years—probably married some tribal chief's daughter in Africa..."

"Penny," Stella interrupted softly. "If... if you knew there was no hope left, would you still wait?"

Penny froze.

She set down her sketchpad and plopped onto the suitcase. "Mrs. Roland, during those four years abroad... did you ever think of giving up?"

Stella's fingers curled slightly.

The first year, she'd fought to protect the life inside her while confined to a hospital bed. When the doctor announced the miscarriage, her world shattered.

The second year, she wandered like a ghost. If not for Ethan and Luna needing their mother, she might have—

The third year, Celeste's first "Mama" had given her the strength to breathe again.

The fourth year, she'd counted every day until she could return to Mount Rainier for their promised reunion.

"Never," she whispered. "Not for a single day."

Penny grinned. "Then neither will I. Even if he really did marry that chief's daughter, I won't believe it until I see it."

The phone rang abruptly.

Adrian Roland's name flashed on the screen, making Stella's heart stutter.

"Packed?" His voice was detached, almost unfamiliar.

"Penny's helping."

"Jason will pick you up in thirty minutes."

"And you?"

"Meeting."

The curt exchange felt like a business transaction. Stella tightened her grip on the phone. "Your injuries—"

"Don't trouble yourself." A pause. "The act is over. Time we both moved on."

Her throat constricted. "Alright."

Paper rustled on his end, hesitation palpable. "...Remember to carry candy."

"You think he'll change his mind?"

"I said all men change." His voice roughened. "Including me."

The call ended abruptly.

In the CEO's office at New Frontier Group, Adrian stared at the darkened screen, knuckles whitening.

"Sir, your hand is shaking," Vincent Astor murmured.

"The AC is too strong."

"It's 82°F outside."

Adrian shut his eyes. "Vincent."

"Yes?"

"This performance is exhausting." He loosened his tie with a bitter smile. "Don't expose me."
###Chapter 366: Bloodstained Memories

"Sir, why are you torturing yourself like this?" Vincent's voice trembled as he took in Adrian's bloodshot eyes.

Adrian raised a hand to silence him, his knuckles turning white.

"I don't deserve it."

The words stabbed Vincent like a knife. He couldn't help but argue, "That car accident was the real culprit! If not for that tragedy—"

"Any progress?" Adrian cut him off abruptly.

Vincent stiffened. "They covered their tracks too well. The two Range Rovers were supposed to be delivered to the Eastside parking lot, but there's no record of them."

"Vanished into thin air?" Adrian's eyes narrowed.

"Yes. In Houston, only someone with..." Vincent trailed off.

Adrian let out a cold laugh. "Keep digging. Start with the tow trucks. Stay under the radar."

"If it really was Mr. Xavier..." Vincent swallowed hard.

"Blood demands blood." Adrian's voice was glacial.

A cold sweat broke out down Vincent's back. He knew a storm was about to engulf Houston.

"Cancel this afternoon's meeting," Adrian said suddenly.

"Are you going to see Mrs. Roland?"

"Mount Rainier."

The motorcycle engine roared along the mountain road. Adrian steered with one hand, his mind eerily blank—except for fragmented flashes of that rainy night.

A black Lincoln limousine idled by the roadside, its window rolling down.

"Made up your mind?" Grant arched an eyebrow.

Adrian stubbed out his cigarette. "What time?"

"Three AM. Heavy rain." Grant studied him meaningfully. "You're really going to recreate that night?"

"Who hired that 'Mr. Alistair'?" Adrian asked abruptly.

"The old man hasn't had time for such games lately." Grant smirked. "Looks like your dear brother."

Adrian's gaze darkened. "The deal stands."

"Wait!" Grant sat up sharply. "What did you give him?"

"The Roland family assets." Adrian's tone was flat. "Uncle Xavier's share remains with me."

Grant exhaled in relief. "You always play the long game."

"So," Adrian's lips curved, "a light collision won't do. Neither will a fatal one."

Grant shook his head with a wry smile. "This is one hell of a transaction."

"The details from that night." Adrian's eyes burned with intensity.

"Mount Rainier to the airport expressway. Torrential rain. Three AM." Grant pointed skyward. "The blood washed away before dawn."

Adrian lit another cigarette. "We wait for nightfall."

Their shadows stretched long in the setting sun. Suddenly, Adrian handed over a document.

"What's this?" Grant's pupils contracted as he unfolded it.

"My waiver of liability." Adrian exhaled a smoke ring. "Adrian Roland never leaves debts unpaid."

Grant's fingers trembled slightly around the paper.

Night was coming.
###Chapter 367: Racing Toward Her

Winter dusk always arrives without warning.

By seven o'clock, the entire city is swallowed by thick darkness. Heavy clouds hang low, blotting out even a single star.

"What a shame," Adrian mutters around the cigarette between his lips, squinting at the sky.

Grant approaches, leaning on his cane. "What's the shame?"

"No stars tonight." He exhales a smoke ring. "It was supposed to be clear."

"You should be glad." Grant glances upward. "The rain's coming—just like that night four years ago. Might actually jog your memory."

CRACK—

Lightning splits the sky, followed by deafening thunder. A sudden gale sends roadside trees swaying violently.

Fat raindrops begin to fall, quickly escalating into a downpour.

Grant whistles. "Looks like heaven's on your side."

A dozen cigarette butts litter the ground at Adrian's feet. He crushes the half-smoked one in his hand, rain instantly dousing it.

Taking two steps back, he flashes a determined smile.

The darkness forces Grant to switch on the headlights. In the dim glow, Adrian stands ten meters ahead, arms outstretched as if embracing something.

"Come on!" His shout is nearly drowned by the storm.

Gritting his teeth, Grant reverses the car. The engine roars like a beast as the Lincoln accelerates.

BANG!

The impact sends a violent shudder through Grant. He slams the brakes, the wet pavement making the car skid another dozen meters before stopping.

His hands tremble as he steps out.

"Adrian?"

Without headlights, only the relentless drumming of rain fills the void.

Where is he?

He was right here.

Unless—

"Adrian! If you're dead, that's on you!" Grant's voice wavers. "You signed the waiver!"

Silence.

Groping through the rain, his cane brushes against something soft.

Kneeling, his fingers meet warmth. The metallic tang of blood floods his senses.

"Adrian?!"

A pained groan answers.

Grant exhales sharply. "Not dead yet. Need an ambulance?"

"No." Adrian's voice trembles between laughter and tears. "This rain...it's really coming down."

"You sure you're okay?"

"Won't die." He struggles to speak. "Help me up...to the bike."

In the faint light, Grant finally sees him clearly.

Adrian lies drenched, only his eyes burning unnaturally bright—not their usual sharpness, but filled with anguish and tenderness.

"You're still riding?"

"Stella's waiting." His voice softens. "She's terrified of thunder."

Long silence. "...You're insane."

"I'll keep my promise."

"What?"

"No matter the past...thank you."

Grant's eyes widen. "You remember?"

Adrian tilts his face to the rain. "What time is it?"

"Almost eight."

"Still time."

"Time for what?"

Staggering upright, his black clothes indistinguishable from blood, Adrian fixes his gaze on the distant motorcycle.

"Eight...the bridal shop's still open."

"What bridal shop?"

He collapses against the bike, his shattered cast dangling uselessly. After several attempts, the engine sputters to life.

"We got married." Suddenly he grins like a child with candy.

"..."

"Under the crabapple tree."

"..."

"She wore a floral sundress as her wedding gown...used my shirt for a veil..."

"..."

"But she loves beautiful things...should have the most gorgeous dress..."

No response comes, not that he expects one.

"She loved me...she chose me..."

Through the night, the motorcycle weaves unsteadily. Falling. Rising. Moving forward.

Toward the bridal shop.

Toward her.
###Chapter 368: A Hollow Heart

The storm raged outside, painting the night in inky darkness.

The curtains in the second-floor bedroom of the Roland family estate flapped violently against the window frame. Stella Valentine stood by the glass, her fingers absently tracing the wooden trim.

"Madam, your luggage is packed." Penny Anderson hovered at the doorway, hesitation in her voice.

Stella glanced at the two suitcases in the corner. "Just a little longer."

"It's already past nine..."

"I know."

Penny sighed and moved to sit beside her. "Mr. Roland won't be coming home tonight."

Stella's fingers stilled. "I wasn't waiting for him."

"Then what are you looking at?"

Beyond the rain-streaked window, streetlights blurred into hazy halos.

"Has the company been...busy lately?"

"Extremely!" Penny counted on her fingers. "The African mine handover, quarterly financial reports, next week's board meeting...Mr. Roland practically lives at the office these days."

Stella lowered her lashes.

Her phone screen lit up abruptly.

[Stella, have you left yet?]

The seventeenth text tonight.

She stared at the glowing display before finally locking it without reply.

"Madam, you look pale."

"It's nothing." Stella adjusted her collar. "Let's go."

They descended the stairs quietly, their rolling suitcases silent against the drumming rain.

The rhythmic pounding on the car roof filled Stella with unease.

"Seatbelt, please." Penny turned the steering wheel cautiously. "We'll need to drive slowly in this downpour."

As blurred scenery slid past the window, Stella spoke suddenly. "Penny."

"Yes?"

"If...hypothetically, someone had been lying to you for a long time...would you forgive them?"

Penny hesitated. "Depends on the circumstances. If it was like what Mr. Roland did before—"

"Not him." Stella cut in sharply. "Someone else."

The car crawled through the storm before finally stopping before Houston Grand Hotel.

"Room 1231." Penny handed over the keycard. "Get some rest, Madam."

Stella had barely entered the lobby when her phone rang.

"Where are you?" The male voice crackled with suppressed anger.

"At the hotel."

"Why didn't you reply?"

"I was packing." She massaged her temple. "We agreed to meet tomorrow."

"Today was the deadline!" The voice rose sharply. "Stella Valentine, are you betraying me too?"

The elevator doors slid shut.

"Mr. Alistair," she inhaled deeply, "what do you actually want?"

"I want to see Adrian Roland! I want back what's rightfully mine!"

Stella watched the ascending floor numbers. "Where are you now?"

"What does it matter? Just tell me your room number!"

Her finger hovered over the end call button. "You don't know which room I'm in?"
###Chapter 369: Like What You See, My Dearest Brother

"Room number?" The voice on the phone dripped with impatience.

Stella Valentine tightened her grip on the phone. "1231."

"Wait."

The call ended abruptly.

The elevator doors slid open before her.

"Your luggage, ma'am." A bellboy nudged the silver cart forward politely.

She nodded mechanically and stepped inside.

The twelfth-floor corridor stretched endlessly.

When Room 1231's door swung open, a blast of chilled air made her shiver.

Everything here felt familiar yet terrifyingly alien.

Traces of her past with Mr. Alistair had long been erased by time.

Now, his heart held only vengeance.

Even his tenderness toward her felt like a performance.

The TV flickered to life.

A dating show's laughter filled the empty suite.

She stared at the successful couples, her nails digging into her palms unconsciously.

Ding-dong—

The doorbell shattered the silence.

"Who is it?"

"Open up."

That voice turned her muscles to stone.

The man outside was drenched, water dripping from his sleeves.

He strode in, scanning the room with a mocking smirk. "Presidential suite? Adrian Roland spoils you."

"This is where we—"

"Oh?" His eyebrow arched. "Remember now. But they redecorated, didn't they?"

"No." Her voice trembled.

"Then my memory fails me." He closed the distance suddenly. "Stella..."

She stumbled back against the wall. "Stay away!"

"Afraid?" His fingers clamped around her wrist. "We've been far more intimate. Why play innocent now?"

"Let go!"

"Shh—" He breathed against her ear. "We have all night to reminisce."

As he lifted her off her feet, she glimpsed a shadow darting past the doorway.

That silhouette...

The bedroom door slammed shut.

Around the corner, Adrian Roland's suit jacket dripped onto the carpet.

He carefully unfolded the wedding gown from his arms.

Pearlescent satin shimmered under dim lighting.

He pictured her wearing it.

Under the crabapple tree, her smile luminous as the swirling skirt.

His phone vibrated, shattering the fantasy.

The image froze his blood.

[Like what you see, brother?]

[She's sweeter than I imagined.]

[Want a live show?]

[Heard you bought a wedding dress. Pity—I'll be the first to take it off her.]

[Guess which button I'm undoing now?]

The phone spiraled into the toilet bowl.

Yet the ringing pierced through the water.

Staring at Room 1231's gaping door, his vision tinted crimson.

Down the hall, his footsteps echoed like Death's scythe scraping concrete.
###Chapter 370: The Mystery of Identity

"Who were you calling?"

Stella Valentine quickly hid her phone behind her back and rushed out of the master bedroom.

The open door to the living room gave her a sliver of relief.

At least here, the hotel staff might hear her if she screamed. The presidential suite, once her safest haven, had become the most dangerous cage.

"The hospital," she said, her voice tight. "Celeste just had surgery."

Vincent Atlante strolled out leisurely, hands in his pockets, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. "She has doctors and nurses. What are you worried about?"

Stella pressed her lips together, silent.

She edged closer to the door, discreetly silencing her phone before dialing the number again.

Still no answer.

Just two days ago, he'd promised to be available anytime. Now, there was only silence.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

"Mom?"

"Stella, where are you?" Grace Laurent's voice came through. "I came straight from the airport to see Celeste. Where are you and Adrian?"

Stella nearly sagged with relief. "I'll be right there!"

"Tell Adrian to drive carefully."

After hanging up, she forced calm into her voice. "Mr. Alistair, my mother is back."

Vincent toyed with his phone, amused. "In such a hurry to leave?"

"My mom is waiting—"

"Fine. I'll take you." He stood. "I’ll be seeing her tomorrow anyway."

Stella clenched her fists. "Wait!"

"Hmm?"

"You can't meet my mother empty-handed."

He frowned. "What does she like?"

"Lilies." She gestured toward the door. "There’s a florist across from the hotel."

The moment Vincent left, a chill ran down Stella’s spine.

Julian Valois’ warning echoed in her ears.

When the elevator doors opened, she almost screamed.

"Why weren’t you answering your phone?" She exhaled sharply.

Adrian Roland’s gaze burned into her. "Where is he?"

"It's a long story. Let’s just go."

"Where?"

"The old house."

Adrian’s expression darkened. "You—"

"Do you have a car?"

"A motorcycle." His eyes swept over her, lingering on her untouched clothes before dimming slightly.

The elevator descended to the underground garage.

Stella scanned the area frantically for the bike, then turned to find Adrian limping badly.

"What’s wrong?"

"Nothing."

Only then did she notice his left arm was free of its cast, his face deathly pale.

"Where’s your cast?"

"Removed it."

"Are you insane?" She steadied him as he swayed. "Our daughter needs you—"

"Stella." His voice was weak. "Call a cab. I can’t ride like this."

Under the harsh hospital lights, the doctor’s face turned grim. "Prep for emergency treatment!"

Adrian, drenched in sweat, slumped against her, barely conscious. "Don’t..."

"It’s just a broken arm..." Stella’s voice shook.

"Just an arm?" The doctor snapped. "He has multiple fractures and internal bleeding! Any later and he’d be dead!"

"How—"

"Who are you to him?" the doctor demanded impatiently.

A nurse gasped. "That’s Mr. Roland and Mrs. Roland!"
###Chapter 371 Are You Trying to Test Me？
The rain hammered against the hospital windows with relentless fury.

Stella Valentine's hand trembled slightly as she signed the last document, her signature barely legible.

"Mrs. Roland, your husband's condition is critical." The nurse handed her a stack of test results. "Multiple fractures, but the most dangerous is hemorrhagic shock."

Her fingers jerked. The fountain pen clattered to the floor.

Lightning flashed outside, illuminating the glaring red light above the ER doors.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

"Stella, I've got the lilies." The voice on the line dripped with honeyed warmth. "We should head to the Roland estate now."

She stared at her reflection in the rain-streaked glass. "What was my mother's favorite flower?"

"Lilies, of course." The answer came too quickly.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Sunflowers. You didn't even know that."

Dead silence filled the line.

"Who are you?" Her voice turned razor-sharp. "Mr. Alistair would never mistake something like that."

"I'm just... distracted." The voice backpedaled frantically. "Yes, sunflowers."

Stella ended the call and blocked the number.

The ER doors hissed open. A doctor rushed out. "Family? We need an emergency blood transfusion!"

She staggered to her feet, her elongated shadow stretching under the fluorescent lights.

Her phone lit up again. Multiple texts appeared in rapid succession:

[Is Adrian dying?]
[The Roland empire belongs to me now.]
[Where are you?]

Each word stabbed like a knife.

The rain intensified, drumming against the glass. Stella suddenly remembered her psychiatrist's words—twins share a unique psychic connection.

That's how he knew the dog's name. The crabapple tree...

But not her mother's sunflowers.

The ER light still burned red. Hugging herself, a horrifying realization crystallized in her mind.

If the connection only transmits fragmented memories...

Then the real Mr. Alistair might be fighting for his life behind those doors.
###Chapter 372: As Long As You Still Want Me

"Mrs. Roland, Mr. Roland has been asking for you." The nurse pushed open the door, urgency lacing her voice.

Stella's fingers tightened unconsciously around the hem of her shirt.

The emergency room door wasn't unfamiliar to her. Four years ago, when she gave birth to Luna, she had lain in this very place—her heart then as barren as a dried-up well, unafraid even of death.

But now was different.

"How is he?"

The nurse handed her an oxygen mask. "The bleeding has stopped, but Mr. Roland refuses treatment. He keeps calling your name."

Stella took the mask, her fingertips trembling slightly.

"Don't be nervous," the nurse reassured softly. "He'll be fine once he sees you."

Taking a deep breath, Stella pushed open the door.

"Stella!"

A scorching embrace engulfed her. Adrian's arms clamped around her like iron bands, the pressure making her bones protest.

"I'm sorry... I came too late..." His voice was hoarse, barely recognizable. "Don't go... please..."

Stella could barely breathe in his crushing hold, yet she gently patted his back. "I'm here."

"You won't lie to me, right?" Adrian suddenly released her, his bloodshot eyes boring into hers. "You won't go to him?"

"Go to who?"

"That man... the one pretending to be me."

Her heart lurched.

She studied the man before her—bandages covering his body, blood seeping from the wound at his temple, his face deathly pale. Yet his gaze remained stubborn, almost frightening in its intensity.

"Put on the oxygen first, okay?" she coaxed softly.

Instead, Adrian grabbed her hand and pressed it against his chest. "This hurts more. Stella, I dreamed you promised to stay with me forever..."

The emergency room was in chaos. An IV stand lay toppled on the floor, monitor wires tangled into knots. Four or five doctors stood in the corner, their white coats wrinkled.

"Mrs. Roland," the attending physician wiped his brow, "if we delay any longer, his wounds will get infected."

Stella nodded, then turned to Adrian. "Let me see your injuries."

"You'll stay?"

"Yes."

"For how long?"

Meeting his hopeful gaze, she whispered, "As long as you're alive."

Adrian suddenly smiled—weak but radiant, like a firefly in the dark.

"I had a dream," he murmured as she helped him lie down. "In it, you said as long as I wasn't Adrian Roland..."

Stella's hands stilled.

"Stella," he suddenly used her full name, his voice feather-light, "I don't want to be Adrian Roland anymore. Let's take the children and leave. Go somewhere no one knows us..."

Tears blurred her vision.

Those words were too familiar. So familiar it made her heart tremble.

"Do you know what you're saying?" she asked, voice shaking.

Adrian's focus was fading, yet he stubbornly clung to her hand. "As long as you still want me... I'll always..."

Before he could finish, his strength gave out, and he fell unconscious.

Stella watched the fluctuating lines on the heart monitor, tears finally spilling over.

Those words. Those promises. Those secrets only two people could know...

It had always been him.
###Chapter 373: The Truth Emerges

Adrian Roland's lips trembled slightly, as if he still wanted to say something.

His body suddenly pitched forward, collapsing heavily onto Stella Valentine.

"Careful!" A nearby doctor swiftly caught him.

Only then did Stella realize how deceptively heavy Adrian was despite his lean frame. She struggled to support him, her arms shaking under his weight.

Nurses quickly adjusted the hospital bed as everyone worked together to lift him onto it.

His breathing grew increasingly labored, yet he stubbornly refused to let go of her hand.

"Mrs. Roland, you should stay here with him," the doctor said, handing her a sterile gown. "We need to operate immediately."

Stella looked down at her fingers, pale from his grip, and whispered soothingly, "Just let go for a moment. I'll be right back."

Adrian's brow furrowed. Only after her repeated assurances did he reluctantly release her.

The operating room lights flickered on, then off.

Ten hours later, the lead surgeon removed his mask, exhaustion etched on his face. "Three broken ribs and pulmonary hemorrhaging. He'll need at least three months of bed rest."

"That serious?"

"That's a conservative estimate." The doctor wiped his forehead. "An ordinary person would've gone into shock by now. Mr. Roland held on until the end and turned our ER upside down."

Stella lowered her head in guilt.

A nurse handed her a plastic bag. "These are Mr. Roland's personal effects."

She took the damp suit jacket, her fingertips brushing against something sticky. Rainwater mingled with blood had left dark stains on the black fabric.

There was also a faint trace of tobacco.

A phone rang abruptly.

"Mrs. Roland, it's Vincent." The voice on the other end sounded urgent. "We haven't been able to reach Mr. Roland—"

"He's in the hospital," Stella said tersely. "His condition is stable now."

Vincent exhaled in relief before his tone turned furious. "Was it Uncle Xavier again?"

"Why would you think that?"

"The car accident four years ago..." Vincent suddenly fell silent.

Stella's heart plummeted. "He was behind that too?"

Silence filled the line.

"Vincent, answer me." Her voice trembled. "Was his driver named Charlie?"

"...Yes."

"Where is he now?"

Vincent sighed deeply. "Mrs. Roland, since you've guessed it... Yes, Mr. Roland is Mr. Alistair. But he couldn't bring himself to tell you. He was afraid of tarnishing your image of 'Mr. Alistair.'"

Stella clenched the phone, her knuckles turning white.

"What happened back then is complicated. Dr. Lowell knows the whole story." Vincent's voice was low. "I'm not asking for your forgiveness, just... give him a chance to make things right."

Morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a thin line across the floor.

"Send Charlie to the hospital," she finally said, her voice as light as a falling feather. "I want to see him."
###Chapter 374: Stella, Come Here

Charlie arrived much sooner than expected.

Twenty minutes later, he stood at the hospital room door, his expression dark and grim. "Ms. Valentine, what exactly happened to Mr. Roland?"

Stella's gaze drifted past him, scanning the empty hallway. "Where is Mr. Alistair?"

He let out a cold laugh. "Now you're looking for him? Weren't you inseparable these past four years? You could’ve just called him. Why go through the trouble of summoning me?"

"And you?" Stella met his eyes directly. "As Mr. Alistair’s personal driver, why are you so concerned about Adrian?"

Charlie’s face stiffened. "Didn’t Vincent ask me to come?"

"You still resent me for leaving back then?"

His eyes turned icy. "If you already know, why ask? He gave up everything for you, and you just took the money he nearly died for and walked away! These past four years without you, he was fine. But the moment you returned, he started hurting himself again!"

Stella lowered her head, her fingers trembling slightly as she stared at her phone screen.

Charlie took a step closer. "Cat got your tongue?"

"Reading a medical report," she murmured.

"Whose? That adopted child’s?"

"Adrian’s." She turned the screen toward him. "Dr. Lowell just sent it. Four years ago, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A second personality emerged."

Charlie recoiled half a step.

"The records show his alter only appeared at night initially. But after we reunited at the Houston Grand Hotel, it started surfacing more frequently." Her voice shook. "After the car accident four years ago, he switched psychiatrists. The records stop there."

Charlie turned away, silence thickening like a wall.

A muffled cough suddenly came from the hospital bed.

"Boss!" Charlie rushed over.

Adrian frowned, his gaze still unfocused.

"Do you remember who I am?" Charlie’s voice was tight.

Adrian managed a weak smile. "Did Stella call you?"

"Yes..."

"Did you two argue?"

"No, I just—"

"I told you," Adrian’s voice was faint, "if I disappeared, you were to protect her and the children in my place. Where were you these past four years?"

Charlie’s eyes reddened instantly. "Boss, you remember everything? Since when—"

"Answer me." Adrian rubbed his temples. "I remember you crying like a child outside the operating room. You promised me."

Charlie clenched his fists. "She doesn’t deserve it."

"That’s not for you to decide."

"But—"

Adrian raised a hand to stop him. "Today is Celeste’s discharge day. I don’t want to scare her like this. Go handle the paperwork." His gaze shifted to Stella. "I need to talk to her."

Charlie left, slamming the door behind him.

The room was so quiet the drip of the IV was audible.

Adrian watched her, his eyes as gentle as moonlit waves.

Stella stood rooted in place, her nails digging into her palms.

"Stella," he called softly, patting the edge of the bed. "Come here."

She didn’t move.

"In the ER," he chuckled weakly, "did I say anything foolish?"

Stella turned to leave. "I’ll get the doctor."

"Stella." He stopped her. "Don’t you have anything to ask me?"

Questions surged like a tide, but not a single word made it past her lips.

"I know you’re confused," he said quietly. "Then let me explain. That man is Vincent Atlante—my twin brother. Victor Lefèvre back then—"

"That’s not what I want to know," she interrupted.

Adrian waited in silence.

Finally, she approached the bed, her voice barely above a whisper. "Does it... still hurt?"
###Chapter 375 Because I Didn't Want You to Be Troubled

Adrian Roland frowned slightly, though a faint smile played on his lips. "A little dizzy."

"You promised to tell me the truth."

His Adam's apple bobbed as he let out a resigned chuckle. "Fine. It still hurts."

Stella Valentine sat by the hospital bed, her fingers unconsciously tightening around the edge of the blanket. "Where does it hurt?"

"Everywhere."

"Anything else?"

"I feel like crying." His lashes lowered, voice rough with emotion. "Pathetic, isn't it? A grown man wanting to cry."

Her nose stung. She adjusted his blanket. "When did you remember?"

"Last night."

She frowned. "But you said on the phone that the man was an imposter. Hadn't you recovered your memories then?"

He shook his head. "Julian Valois told me. I... had my suspicions. The flashbacks, your descriptions of Mr. Alistair... But I couldn't believe it. You said Mr. Alistair died four years ago, yet I was alive."

"So Julian confirmed it?"

"Yes."

"Then why did you deny it?"

Adrian took a deep breath, turmoil flickering in his eyes. "I didn't want you to be troubled."

"..."

"You loved Mr. Alistair and hated Adrian Roland. The truth would only hurt you. If someone was willing to play the role of Mr. Alistair... As long as he treated you well, I was content to stay silent forever."

Stella scoffed. "How do you know he wasn't after the Roland family's wealth?"

"All he wants is money or revenge. I can give him both."

"Even if you go bankrupt, he wouldn't treat me kindly."

"That's why I left a backup plan." His gaze sharpened. "I divided the assets equally among the children. As their guardian, you have the final say. If he dares mistreat you, he won't get a single cent."

A sly glint flashed in his eyes. "I'll watch over you from the shadows, just like before."

"And what about you?" Her voice trembled.

"Me?" He chuckled softly. "Just seeing you safe is enough."

Silence settled over the room.

From the neighboring room, the TV played Empresses in the Palace. The faint sound of the protagonist's lament drifted in: "That year, beneath the apricot blossoms in the drizzle, you claimed to be Prince Guo..."

"Fitting," Adrian murmured suddenly.

Stella understood and smiled faintly. "The day we met was a downpour."

"True." His gaze softened. "So where's your Prince Guo? Weren't you supposed to meet him today?"

"I'm not Zhen Huan." Her voice was quiet. "I'm not as strong as her."

Adrian suddenly asked, "Do you know when I fell in love with you?"

Stella froze.

In their school days, he had been the golden boy, while she saw him only as the boy next door. Until that unexpected first kiss...

"Why bring this up now?" Her ears burned.

"The first time I saw you, I thought you were like a proud little peacock." Amusement danced in his eyes. "But what really made me fall for you was when you stood up for Joy Fairsprene."

Stella wanted to disappear.

That had been her most cringe-worthy moment—her scrawny self blocking a group of bullies, chin raised as she hurled insults.

"...Don't bring up my embarrassing past."

"The way you cursed them out is something I'll never forget." He laughed. "A pretty little girl calling herself 'grandma' and pointing at them, yelling 'you brats'..."

"So you fell for me because I could swear?"

"I fell for you because you were terrified but still stood up for others." His gaze burned. "I wanted you to always be proud, without needing to raise your defenses."

"..."

"You were meant to be the brightest rising star in design." His voice grew quiet. "But... I destroyed all of that."
###Chapter 376: He's Just Secretly Romantic

"Let bygones be bygones." Stella Valentine sighed softly, her fingertips unconsciously tracing the rim of her coffee cup.

Adrian Roland's gaze lingered on her slightly trembling lashes. "You're braver than I imagined. The company wasn't your fault."

"But I couldn't even protect my father's business." She gave a bitter smile. "Mr. Xavier was right. I'm not cut out for the corporate world."

Suddenly, her eyes widened. "Wait! Mr. Xavier said he wanted an heir, not a romantic... So you were his choice from the beginning?"

Adrian nodded. "He needed an heir with no attachments."

"His legs..."

"Crushed in an accident orchestrated by the woman he loved most." Adrian's voice turned somber. "That's why he never trusts anyone."

"Then why does he trust you?"

After a pause, Adrian replied, "Perhaps because... with both parents gone, I pose no threat to him."

A phone ringtone shattered the moment.

Stella glanced at the unfamiliar number, lips quirking. "Another call for you?"

"My phone..." Adrian cleared his throat. "Got water damage."

"Water damage?" She arched an eyebrow.

"Answer it first." He averted his gaze.

Penny Anderson's frantic voice burst through the speaker: "Mrs. Roland! The boss has gone AWOL again!"

"Why did you change numbers?"

"I think he blocked me!" Penny whined. "All because of that overtime pay dispute..."

Stella stifled a laugh. "He has been a bit..."

"A bit?!" Penny lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Do you know how many floral sundresses he secretly bought? All in your size! And my handwriting—just because it resembles your calligraphic script..."

Stella's head snapped toward Adrian.

He mouthed in confusion: What's wrong?

Shaking her head, she continued listening as Penny spilled more secrets: "Last year, someone hung star lights in his office and got fired on the spot! Yet he'd stare at the stars all night..."

"Often?"

"Only improved after you returned." Penny suddenly hushed. "That Wendy Evans is thriving now, livestreaming daily using the boss's clout..."

Stella's fingers stilled. "Good for her."

"Good?!" Penny fumed. "She spread rumors about the boss cheating, playing the victim to gain followers..."

"Penny." Stella interrupted. "Let's have dinner this weekend."

"Really? Atlantis Seafood!"

"Deal."

"Can we... make it cash instead?" Penny's tone turned instantly sycophantic.

Stella chuckled. "No."

"Why not?!"

"Because..." She shot a glance at Adrian, who was pretending to review documents. "Someone needs to apologize in person."

Three seconds of silence preceded Penny's uproarious laughter: "Got it! Please come back soon, Mrs. Roland. Sure, the boss is icy, stingy, and workaholic... but he misses you terribly."

Hanging up, Stella met Adrian's questioning look.

"Penny mentioned..." She deliberately drew out the words. "Someone purchased three thousand floral sundresses?"

Adrian's ears turned scarlet.
###Chapter 377: The Unbreachable Wall

Penny counted Adrian's "crimes" on her fingers, her voice rising with indignation. When accusing him of stinginess, she nearly blurted out "miserly old scrooge."

Loud words always come with consequences.

The gentle female voice on the phone vanished, replaced by a chillingly deep male tone. "Heartless? Nitpicky? Stingy?"

Penny froze mid-rant, her complaints lodged in her throat. "B-Boss? What a coincidence! You're with Mrs. Roland?"

Adrian gave a dry chuckle. "What do you think?"

"I—I just remembered some urgent paperwork. Goodbye, Boss!"

The call ended abruptly. Beads of sweat formed on Penny's forehead.

Adrian handed the phone back to Stella, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "My secretary has quite the nerve."

Stella took the phone and guided him back to the hospital bed. "You have a leg fracture, yet you dared to get up?"

"Little Star."

"Hmm?"

"You scolded me just like this when I got injured playing soccer in college."

Stella shot him a glare. "The great Adrian Roland was too proud to go to the hospital, even when sweating from pain. Couldn't let the school heartthrob image crumble."

"Half the female student body was watching. I couldn’t let them see me limping." His eyes gleamed with mischief. "Unlike you, who received twice as many love letters as I did."

"Too bad a certain jealous someone intercepted them all."

Silence settled over the room.

Adrian leaned against the headboard, pale but intense. Stella's ears burned under his gaze. "Stop staring."

"Just thinking... those were good days." His voice was barely above a whisper. "How long has it been since we talked like this?"

Her heart clenched.

"Back then."

The phrase was a dull knife slowly sawing at her chest.

"Being scolded by you was a privilege," he said suddenly.

"Don't be ridiculous—"

"It’s true."

She turned away as he continued, "Two things you should know. One good, one bad."

"The good news first."

"I've recovered all of Mr. Alistair's memories."

Her fingers twitched. "And the bad?"

"Vincent lied to you." His voice turned heavy. "Our Samoyed... has been dead for years."

Stella's grip tightened on the bedsheet.

"The airline compensated us. I just remembered." His voice grew quieter. "And Celeste... I want to bring her home."

"Where is she buried?"

"Next to the old estate. We can visit every day." He gave a bitter smile. "Though I know you don’t want to live there anymore."

Her chest constricted.

The word "forgiveness" stuck in her throat, refusing to come out.

"Mr. Alistair was just a persona—"

"Enough!" She stood abruptly. "I need space."

Adrian nodded silently.

Stella fled the room. The night air hit her face as she hailed a cab. Just as she pulled the door open, a large hand clamped over her mouth and nose.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The hospital door creaked open.

"Daddy!" A tearful child's voice rang out.

Vincent carried Celeste with an apologetic look. "She insisted on seeing you."

Adrian opened his arms, and the little girl scrambled into them, her eyes red-rimmed. "Daddy, it hurts."

"Should Daddy kiss it better?"

"Secret first!" Celeste whispered conspiratorially. "Remember what I said before your surgery?"
###Chapter 378: I Know You're Not My Daddy

The little girl squirmed restlessly in his arms, her tiny hands climbing up his shoulders. She accidentally pressed against Adrian's injured left arm, making him suck in a sharp breath from the pain.

Charlie immediately stepped forward. "Celeste, don't—"

Adrian silenced him with a look, shaking his head slightly to indicate it was fine. After a brief hesitation, Charlie retreated from the hospital room.

Carefully supporting his left arm with his right hand, Adrian shifted it to rest on the pillow, making space for the little girl.

"What's this big secret?" he asked gently.

Unaware of his discomfort, Celeste leaned close to his ear, covering her mouth with one small hand. "Actually, I know... you're not my daddy."

Adrian froze.

The girl's face was still pale from surgery, but her eyes sparkled. "But I like you. I want you to be my daddy."

"Why me?"

"Because you're nice to Mommy," Celeste said seriously. "I like anyone who's nice to Mommy."

A faint smile touched Adrian's lips. "That's all?"

"There's also that doctor uncle who treated us to dinner. He's nice to Mommy too, but I can tell he doesn't really mean it." She wrinkled her nose. "I don't want him as my daddy."

Adrian immediately recalled the man from the dating show—the one whose profile bore an uncanny resemblance to his own.

"What about Uncle Hugo?" he asked softly.

Celeste tilted her head in thought. "Uncle Hugo is good. Big Brother said so too."

"Then why—"

"Because Mommy doesn't like Uncle Hugo!" The little girl suddenly grinned mischievously. "Mommy only likes you."

Adrian raised an eyebrow. "How do you know? We'd never met before."

"I'll tell you a secret," Celeste whispered conspiratorially. "Mommy has a little box with a blue checkered tie inside. Once the box fell, and the tie got dirty. Mommy cried so hard..."

A blue checkered tie.

Adrian's heart clenched.

He gently smoothed the girl's tousled hair. Stella always kept Celeste neatly dressed, but days in the hospital had left her hair messy and unkempt.

"You love Mommy very much."

"Mm! I love Mommy most!" Her voice suddenly dropped. "Daddy... I have another secret..."

"What is it?"

"I... I'm not Mommy's real daughter."

Adrian's arm tightened around her. "Who told you that?"

Celeste burrowed into his chest like a small bird. "My real daddy called yesterday... He said he's coming to take me away." Her voice trembled. "Daddy, please tell Mommy I'll be good. I won't eat snacks anymore. I can even eat less rice... Please don't let them send me away."

His heart ached as he held her closer. "Mommy would never do that."

"But—"

"As long as I'm here, no one can take you."

......

The hospital garden was deserted.

Stella wrenched herself free, her voice sharp. "Have you lost your mind?"

Vincent took a drag from his cigarette, backing her into a corner. "Ignoring my calls, blocking me—all to be with your ex?" He exhaled a cloud of smoke. "Don't hate him anymore?"

She scrubbed at her lips, the acrid smell clinging stubbornly.

Mr. Alistair would never do this. He carried only a faint trace of tobacco, and after meeting her, he'd quit entirely.

Now she could clearly tell the twins apart. Despite sharing identical features, Adrian never wore that same smirking arrogance, even at his angriest.

"Say something." Vincent reached to touch her face.

Stella jerked away.

His hand hovered mid-air before his expression softened unnaturally. "Are you mad? I was just worried—"

"Enough." Stella cut him off. "You want to return to the Roland family estate and claim your birthright, don't you?"

Vincent's lips curled. "Of course. I am Roland blood." He leaned closer, his breath hot against her ear. "Then we'll go see the crabapple blossoms. You'll see I wasn't lying."
###Chapter 379: Till Death Do Us Part

Stella Valentine's fingers trembled slightly.

She had intended to expose the impostor immediately but changed her mind at the last moment.

Adrian Roland once mentioned having a twin brother.

If this man truly shared Adrian's bloodline, she knew Adrian would willingly surrender his entire fortune without hesitation.

What unsettled her more was the timing.

Why reveal himself now?

Someone was pulling the strings behind the scenes.

Unless she uncovered the mastermind, the danger would never end.

"The crabapple tree can wait." She suppressed her rising emotions. "We'll visit another day."

Vincent Atlante narrowed his eyes. "Fine. Then let's head straight to the old mansion to see Grandfather."

"Wait." Stella tightened her grip on her purse strap. "I left something at the hotel."

"What could be so important?"

"I need it now."

Vincent suddenly leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. "Stella, are you afraid of me?"

Her spine stiffened. "You frightened me last night."

"What's wrong with intimacy between husband and wife?" His lips curled into a cold smile. "Or have you forgotten this marriage is just an act?"

"That's not—"

"Prove it then." He seized her wrist. "Once we secure the Roland fortune, we'll have children of our own."

Stella yanked her hand back. "Why were you at the hospital?"

"Just passing by."

"Really?" She met his gaze head-on. "Celeste was being discharged today."

A flicker of tension crossed his face before he chuckled. "Ah, so that's it. Let's go retrieve your belongings."

Inside the taxi, Stella pressed herself against the door.

"Houston Grand Hotel." Vincent gave the address, his fingers tracing idle circles on her knee.

Bile rose in her throat. At the hotel entrance, she spun around abruptly. "Wait here."

"Why can't I come up?"

"Five minutes." She pointed to the lobby. "There's only one exit."

After a tense pause, he relented. "Hurry."

The elevator doors barely closed before Stella dialed Vincent Astor. "Get Grandfather and the children out immediately!"

"What's wrong?"

"No time! Just go!"

She rushed down the hallway to Room 1231.

The fingerprint lock beeped—then a brutal shove sent her stumbling into darkness.

Hot breath grazed her neck.

"My dear wife," Vincent's voice slithered like a serpent, "who were you calling?"

He pinned her against the door.

"Let me go!"

"Patience." He yanked the curtain cord loose, binding her wrists. "We're making a special video."

"You're insane!"

"Let's see how Adrian's weak heart handles this." He aimed his phone's camera. "One video might not be enough..."

Her blood turned to ice.

"...until it kills him."

"They're your family!"

"Family?" Vincent exploded in rage. "The Rolands will pay in blood!"

Dragging her by the restraints, he hauled her toward the unmade bed.

"Guess what?" He tore off his tie. "This might finally push him to suicide."

Stella scrambled backward. "I'll give you anything!"

"I want him dead." His grip crushed her jaw. "I want the Roland line ended."

The camera's red light blinked coldly.

Suddenly, Stella smiled. "Did your puppet master forget to mention?"

"What?"

"This room has surveillance." She stared directly into the lens. "Every crime you've committed since entering is recorded."

Vincent's face twisted.

In that split second of distraction, Stella rammed her shoulder into the nightstand.

Sirens blared through the entire floor.
###Chapter 380: Mr. Alistair Would Never Be This Despicable!

Vincent Atlante's eyes gleamed with madness, his lips curling into a cruel smirk. "Be a good girl, Miss Valentine. Cooperate, and I promise not to hurt you."

Stella Valentine gasped as sharp pain shot through her wrist.

Never before had she felt the sheer disparity in strength between men and women so viscerally. His grip was like an iron vise, crushing her delicate bones.

"Does it hurt?" Vincent taunted, snapping photos of her pained expression with his phone. "The more you suffer, the more Adrian will ache for you."

"Just tell him what you want. He'll agree."

"Not necessarily." His laugh was icy. "The Roland fortune is far vaster than you imagine. You grew up pampered, Miss Valentine. You don't understand the value of money. To me, every cent is life itself—and I won't let anyone take what's rightfully mine!"

With sudden violence, he hurled her onto the bed.

Though the mattress softened the impact, the ropes had already scraped her wrists raw. Blood seeped through.

As he tightened the restraints, Vincent propped his phone on the dresser at the foot of the bed.

The camera angle captured the entire scene.

Stella's heart plummeted.

While he adjusted the phone, she inched toward the headboard.

She knew this bedroom well.

The sofa at the foot of the bed—just beside it was the house phone!

Vincent whirled around.

She lunged for the phone but was yanked back by the ropes, stumbling.

"Trying to call for help?" His sinister voice slithered behind her.

Gritting her teeth, she threw herself forward—her fingertips brushed the receiver.

"Room 1231! I'm being—"

CRASH!

Vincent ripped the phone from her grasp and smashed it against the floor.

Shards of plastic scattered.

Crouching, he seized her chin with freezing fingers. "Try that again, Miss Valentine, and I can't guarantee you'll leave here in one piece."

This face—identical to Adrian's—now filled her with terror.

Adrian's anger burned hot. But this man's gaze was glacial.

"Uncle Xavier was right," Vincent sneered, tightening his grip. "Women are born actresses. One moment, you're the devoted lover. The next, you betray without hesitation."

Stella choked as he forced her head back. "You...lied to me first..."

"So what?" His smirk was merciless. "The ends justify the means."

"Mr. Alistair would never be this vile!"

"Exactly why I'm not him." His fingers dug deeper. "Do you think Adrian is some saint? How many companies has he swallowed? How many families has he ruined? Compared to him, I've only deceived one person—you."

Tears streaked down her cheeks.

"Crying?" He released her, rubbing her tears between his fingers. "Perfect. Let Adrian see this."

DING-DONG.

The doorbell rang.

"Miss Valentine? Did you call for assistance?" A waiter's voice carried through the door.

Stella opened her mouth to scream—

Vincent clamped a hand over her lips. "Make a sound," he whispered against her ear, "and I'll strip you naked for the camera."

She froze.

She couldn't drag Adrian into this.

Those photos could never see the light of day.

"Scared?" Vincent smirked, releasing her. "Stay put."

He strode to the door.

"Mr. Roland?" The waiter blinked in surprise. "The front desk received a distress call from Miss Valentine—"

"We were playing a game." Vincent flashed a charming smile. "She lost. The penalty was faking a kidnapping."

Recognizing the face of Houston's most powerful tycoon, the waiter instantly relaxed. "Ah, I see. You two are quite the playful couple."

"Aren't we?"

"At the birthday gala last week, you and Miss Valentine looked absolutely made for each other!"

A shadow flickered in Vincent's eyes. "Thank you."

"Shall I have the phone repaired?"

"No need." His tone turned dismissive. "We'd prefer privacy."

"Of course. Enjoy your evening."

As the door clicked shut, Stella's hope shattered.

###Chapter 381 They Deserve It.

The door slammed shut with a heavy thud.

Vincent Atlante paced back with a cigarette dangling from his lips, the ember flickering in the dim room. He looked down at Stella Valentine curled on the floor and exhaled a smoke ring. "Heard everything clearly?"

Stella turned her face away, her long hair obscuring half of her cheek.

"This face sure comes in handy," he flicked the ash, "Even the hotel staff recognized you. Must've come here often for your little rendezvous."

Perhaps this unexpected episode improved Vincent's mood, his tone carrying an unusual casualness.

"You want to know?" Stella suddenly spoke.

Vincent raised an eyebrow and sat on the bed's edge, crossing his legs leisurely. "Entertain me."

She struggled to lift her bound hands. "Untie me first. My phone's broken, the staff's gone. I can't run."

Vincent narrowed his eyes, twirling the cigarette between his fingers.

"Twelfth floor," Stella said calmly. "A jump would be fatal."

"Heard you're a jewelry designer?" Vincent asked abruptly.

"Yes."

"Then these hands must be precious." His smile turned meaningful. "Should take good care of them."

He suddenly pressed the burning cigarette against the rope. The flame hissed as it caught.

The searing pain made Stella's entire body tense, but she didn't utter a sound.

When the rope burned through, she swiftly withdrew her hands. The blistering burns around her wrists looked horrifying.

"Quite the endurance," Vincent whistled. "Others would've been screaming bloody murder."

Stella gently touched her wounds. "Not even a tenth of what I've endured before."

"Childbirth?" Vincent scoffed. "Three kids for Adrian Roland. How devoted."

"The first was an accident." Her voice softened. "The night before our wedding, a car crash took my father and his parents."

"Serves them right." Vincent blew smoke rings.

"He believed my father's drunk driving killed his parents. My uncle Victor seized Roland Group. He hated me for it."

Vincent burst into laughter. "So he thought you were in on it too?"

"I fled overseas when pregnant. The baby went straight to ICU after birth. Stayed five years."

"That smart boy?" Vincent tapped his cigarette. "Spitting image of Adrian."

"To save him, I needed another child with Adrian for the cord blood."

"Hence the daughter." Vincent's eyes narrowed. "Heard you had lung cancer then?"

Stella nodded. "Nine months without treatment."

The room fell silent.

Vincent stubbed out his cigarette. "I respect your grit." He suddenly leaned closer. "But the Rolands will pay in blood."

Stella's pupils constricted.

"Relax," he grinned. "I settle scores clean. Your kids never wronged me. After dealing with Adrian and the old man, I'll give you money. Take them far away."

This twist stunned Stella.

"Now, time for my story." Vincent lit another cigarette. "Someone should remember I existed."

Through the swirling smoke, his voice drifted like distant echoes:

"Human traffickers bought me for fifty grand. Sold and resold countless times. Ended up in some backwater, nursing sickly foster parents."

"Stole, cheated, did everything. Nearly got beaten to death once. Until that day—" He suddenly chuckled. "Saw a face identical to mine on a street-side TV."

"All suited up, surrounded by admirers. They said it was the heir to Roland Group."
###Chapter 382: I Never Rely on Men to Survive

Vincent Atlante clenched a cigarette between his teeth, its crimson ember flickering in the dim bedroom.

Thick smoke stung Stella Valentine's throat. She covered her mouth, coughing twice as tears pricked her eyes.

"Almost forgot," Vincent exhaled a smoke ring. "Adrian Roland mentioned you have lung issues. Shouldn't smoke around you."

Instead of extinguishing it, he took a deep drag and blew the smoke directly at her. "Too bad I hate following his orders."

Stella suppressed another cough, steadying herself against the sofa as she stood.

"Running away?" Vincent grabbed her wrist.

"Opening a window." She winced as his calloused palm ground against her burn blisters. Pus seeped out, staining her sleeve.

Vincent studied his hand with amusement. "Not like the precious Mr. Roland's hands, are they? He grew up in luxury. I clawed my way through the dirt."

Suddenly Stella remembered Mr. Alistair's hands.

Those hands had always cradled her fingers gently, brushing her hair in the moonlight. Though slightly rough, they never caused her pain.

She should have realized sooner.

The forced handholding at the rose garden. The brutal way he'd tried to assault her. Beyond the identical face, Vincent shared nothing with Mr. Alistair.

Even his voice had changed—now hoarse with a strange regional lilt, unsettling as a snake's hiss.

"Let's end this." Vincent tossed her purse at her. "Call Adrian Roland."

"Using my name?"

"Naturally." His lips twisted. "Men don't need women as messengers. I keep my word—no matter the outcome, you walk free."

Stella gripped the purse strap. This madman clearly intended to drag Adrian down with him.

She had to stay calm.

Vincent wanted to exploit her influence over Adrian. But what if that influence didn't exist?

The Roland security system was impenetrable. If Adrian refused to see him, Vincent wouldn't get within ten feet.

"Hate him?" Vincent leaned in suddenly. "After what he did, why not help me destroy him?"

"He's my children's father." Stella's laugh was icy. "I won't seek revenge. Nor will I forgive."

"Such a saint."

"I just won't humiliate my kids." She lifted her chin. "When they're grown, Adrian and I will become strangers."

Vincent narrowed his eyes. "Still love him?"

"Love someone who nearly killed me?" Her voice shook. "Even Mr. Alistair was a lie. What's left to cling to?"

A phone notification chimed.

Vincent smiled as he saved the recording. "Perfect. This will make him walk willingly to his death."
###Chapter 383: Leave Stella Out of This - Come at Me

In the hospital room, Celeste slept soundly curled up in Adrian Roland's arms.

Charlie Macmillan burst through the door. "Boss, we've got trouble—"

Adrian shot him a sharp glare. "Lower your voice."

Charlie's face was pale, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Adrian slowly withdrew his arm, moving as delicately as if disarming a bomb. The pain from the fading anesthesia made his jaw clench, veins bulging at his temples.

"Help me outside," he ordered in a hushed tone.

In the hallway, Charlie brought a chair. "The doctor said your leg—"

"Get to the point." Adrian cut him off, knuckles rapping impatiently on the armrest.

"Vincent just called. Ms. Valentine instructed him to immediately relocate the old master and the children."

Adrian's pupils constricted. "When?"

"An hour ago. We can't reach her now."

"Track her location." Adrian stood abruptly, IV stand rattling violently. "Now!"

Charlie's eyes reddened with frustration. "She's not worth this! She admitted it herself—she was only with you for the money!"

"Give me my phone." Adrian's voice was glacial.

"Wake up! She wouldn't even look at you after learning the truth!"

Adrian's fist smashed into the wall, knuckles splitting. "Take Celeste home. That's an order."

Once Charlie left, he dialed Vincent.

"Find her last known coordinates." Each word sounded wrenched from between clenched teeth.

Hanging up, he made another call.

"Where did you take Stella?" No pleasantries.

Vincent Atlante's amused laughter crackled through. "I was just looking for you. Don't worry—just tied her hands, gave her a little cigarette souvenir..."

"You're dead!" Veins throbbed in Adrian's neck.

"Shouldn't twins share a psychic link?" Vincent lowered his voice mockingly. "The sounds she made earlier were quite... musical."

The glass window spiderwebbed under Adrian's crushing grip.

"Want a video? Her all trussed up like—" The laughter cut off abruptly as the line went dead.

Adrian stared at the darkened screen, eyes burning with murderous rage.
###Chapter 384: If It Were You, Could You Forgive Lily Savigny?

"What more do you want? I've given you everything I can!"

On the phone screen, the large bed stood out starkly in the dim light. It was Room 1231 at the Houston Grand Hotel—a place he knew all too well.

Stella Valentine was tied to the center of the bed, her wrists red from the ropes, her eyes filled with terror.

Adrian Roland felt blood rush to his head. Ignoring hospital rules, he roared into the phone, "Vincent Atlante, if you lay a finger on her, I'll make you wish you were dead!"

"Wish I were dead?" Vincent's laughter crackled through the receiver. "I'd love to see you try."

"What do you want...?" Adrian's voice suddenly softened. "Just tell me..."

"What if I want your life?"

"Fine!" he answered without hesitation. "Put Stella on the phone. I need to know she's safe."

Vincent tsked. "Did you hear that, Miss Valentine? He's willing to die for you. Doesn't that move your heart?"

Adrian held his breath, his fingers tightening around the phone.

Was she crying? In the video, she was trembling with fear.

She was strong, but she was still just a young woman. Kidnapped by a desperate man, forced to face the truth—how hopeless she must feel.

"Stella... little star? Can you hear me?"

"The speaker's on," Vincent said mockingly. "Miss Valentine, say something. Or he'll think I've hurt you."

"Haven't you?"

Stella's voice was unexpectedly calm, even tinged with impatience. "Why drag me into your family feud? I've done nothing to either of you!"

Vincent's tone turned icy. "Watch your mouth."

"Adrian Roland, Mr. Atlante—I want nothing more to do with the Roland family. It doesn't matter who 'Mr. Alistair' really was. I'll erase that memory completely."

"Erase...?" Adrian felt as if he'd been struck by lightning.

"What else should I do? The man I loved turned out to be the one who hurt me the most. If it were you, could you forgive Lily Savigny?"

Adrian's throat worked, but no words came out.

"Please, just let me go. You played the devoted husband in public, and now all of Houston knows I'm your weakness. Today it's Vincent. Tomorrow it could be anyone. I just want a quiet life—no more of your battles!"

Vincent's gaze grew dangerous.

Stella spoke faster. "Vincent lied to me, but he's still your brother. He's suffered for over thirty years. He deserves his share of the Roland fortune."

"...I know."

"He promised to give me and the children a settlement once he gets the assets. He hasn't hurt me. Don't provoke him."

"But he kidnapped you."

"It was a moment of anger. We've agreed—he'll release me soon."

"'We'?" Adrian's voice shook. "You and him—"

"Just don't challenge him. Give him what he wants."

"Then... let me come get you?"

"No!" she nearly shouted. "You got hurt trying to recover your memories. We're even now. Stay away from me."

Before he could respond, she lunged at Vincent, snatched the phone, and hurled it out the window.

Twelve floors below, glass shattered.

Vincent stared at his empty hand and smirked. "Women. Always lying."

Stella backed away, grabbing a lamp and pointing it at him. "Let him go. He's badly injured—he can't fight you anymore."

Vincent easily wrested the lamp from her and tossed it out the window. Another crash echoed up.

"Clever women are such trouble." His hand closed around her slender throat, tightening slowly. "I told you to lure him here, not crush his hopes. Miss Valentine, you've ruined everything."
###Chapter 385: Stella, I Think I'm Starting to Like You. What Should I Do?

His fingers suddenly tightened.

Stella felt the world spin violently as her throat was crushed, each breath becoming a luxury.

"You...kill me...you won't...escape either..."

Vincent's laughter exploded in her ears. "Forgotten? This face is my best shield. The police will only go after Adrian Roland."

Her heart plummeted to the depths.

So this was his plan all along!

With identical faces, who would believe Adrian had a twin brother?

Especially since Adrian was a public figure—security cameras would only capture "Adrian Roland committing murder."

Even the hotel staff could testify she'd entered Room 1231 with Adrian...

"Does it hurt?" Vincent wiped her tear with his thumb. "Pity. You could've lived if you'd just helped me seize the Roland fortune and replace Adrian."

The air grew thinner.

Stella kicked desperately but couldn't budge him.

"Now you'll pay for ruining everything."

Darkness crept into her vision.

Just before losing consciousness, Vincent suddenly released her.

She collapsed against the wall, coughing violently, gulping precious air.

Vincent crouched down, eyes venomous. "Listen well. Cross me again, and I won't just kill you. I'll use this face to commit every crime imaginable. Your children will grow up as a murderer's sons, trampled underfoot forever."

Stella gasped for air as her vision cleared.

Vincent's face hovered inches away.

Identical to Adrian's, yet utterly different in the eyes.

Adrian's gaze was always forthright, while Vincent's brimmed with darkness.

"Why are you smiling?" Vincent snarled.

Stella pointed weakly at the window. "Two falling objects in a row? Hotel security will be here soon."

"I have enough time to finish you."

"But you can't escape." Her lips curved. "Your fingerprints are on the phone and lamp. Faces can lie, not fingerprints. The Roland fortune will still be Adrian's. You get nothing."

Vincent seized her throat again. "You're dead!"

"I'm offering you a way out." She pried at his fingers. "Adrian promised you half the fortune. Take the money and leave Houston. Abandon your revenge."

Vincent suddenly laughed. "Stella Valentine, I think I'm starting to like you. Few women dare bargain with a wanted man."

"Because you're no fool." She met his gaze. "You know how to choose what benefits you most."

"Ha! Fascinating."

"Choose. A life on the run? Or wealth and peace? We'll keep your secret. You can live comfortably."

......

The phone rang abruptly.

Adrian answered. "Vincent."

"Sir! Mrs. Roland's phone is pinging at Houston Grand Hotel!"

"Understood."

"Should we alert the police? She might be in danger—"

"No police." Adrian's voice tightened. "I just spoke with Stella. She's safe for now."

"Then what—"

Adrian closed his eyes.

His chest ached dully.

He'd anticipated this outcome when the truth surfaced. Yet hearing her vow to erase all memories of Mr. Alistair still felt like a dull knife twisting in his heart.

One misstep led to this.

Even stolen moments as Mr. Alistair were just a mirage.

"Sir! There's trouble at Houston Grand Hotel!"

Adrian's eyes flew open. "What happened?"

"Falling objects hit a car. Owner called police. The location...directly below Room 1231."
###Chapter 386: I Told Her You're My Wife

Sirens wailed outside the Houston Grand Hotel as police barricades sealed off the entire building.

A surging crowd pressed against the perimeter, leaving no space uncovered.

"Boss, the road's completely blocked ahead." Charlie slammed the brakes, tires screeching against asphalt.

Adrian's gaze remained locked on the hotel entrance. "Get out."

"But your legs—"

"Shut up."

The car door flew open. With both legs in casts, standing was nearly impossible. He collapsed back onto the seat with a thud.

Vincent arrived just in time, pushing a wheelchair. "Got it here."

As they lifted him into the chair, Adrian's shirt was already drenched in cold sweat.

"Sir, your injuries..." Vincent's voice trembled.

"Where's Stella?" Adrian cut him off.

Vincent swallowed hard. "...She's missing."

"What do you mean missing?!"

"The hotel staff thought she was with you...so they let them leave."

Adrian's knuckles turned white. "They left together?"

"Yes."

"Was she hurt?"

Vincent avoided his gaze. "You...should see the footage."

The surveillance video showed Stella being led out by a man who looked identical to Adrian. The impostor held her tightly against his chest, her wrists clamped in his grasp.

"Damn it!" Charlie punched the car door. "She actually went with that fake—"

"The front desk said," Vincent added reluctantly, "Mrs. Roland had reported a kidnapping earlier, but the staff saw them...playing some kind of roleplay game."

Charlie exploded. "What kind of sick game is that?!"

"The room had ropes, cigarette burns..." Vincent's voice dropped. "The sheets were torn."

"That bitch!" Charlie turned to Adrian. "Boss, she's not worth—"

"Enough." Adrian stared at his phone screen. "She has every right to hate me."

"But now she's—"

"Take me to Room 1231." Adrian interrupted. "I need to see for myself."

Vincent hesitated. "The scene might be...disturbing."

"Could it be worse than this?" Adrian sneered. "Push me there."

......

Stella woke to searing pain.

The stench of mildew mixed with cooked food filled the cramped space. Faint sunlight seeped through cracks in the wooden shutters—the only light in the dingy ten-square-foot hut.

Weathered farming tools hung on crumbling walls. She lay on a pile of straw, her wrists bruised purple from restraints.

Her last memory was of the hotel—Vincent Atlante pressing a chemical-soaked cloth over her face.

The door creaked open.

A hunched peasant woman entered, carrying a chipped ceramic bowl. Her clouded eyes held kindness as she offered steaming rice with a gap-toothed smile.

"She can't speak."

Vincent Atlante kicked the door wider, dropping onto the squeaky bed. The old woman gestured frantically, her expression furious.

"She's cursing me out." Vincent snatched the bowl, shoveling food into his mouth. "I told her you're my wife. She killed her only laying hen for this soup."

Stella turned away. "I'm not hungry."

"Suit yourself." Vincent gulped loudly. "As a kid, I only smelled broth like this at New Year's."

The woman stomped her foot, her calloused hands signing faster.

"What's she saying?" Stella asked.

Vincent licked his lips. "That I don't know how to cherish my woman." He leaned in, his breath reeking of grease. "Should I tell her you're actually Mrs. Roland?"
###Chapter 387: His Weakness—Is You

"Adoptive mother?" Vincent Atlante sneered, downing the last gulp of chicken soup. "More accurately, my buyer. She paid fifty grand for me. If not for her, Victor Lefèvre wouldn't have sold me for quick cash. I should've been a Roland heir—living in luxury instead of suffering."

Stella Valentine remained silent.

"Think I'm ungrateful? She did raise me as her own."

Stella pressed her lips together before asking, "Is this your home?"

"Yeah." Vincent wiped his mouth. "Deep in the mountains. Hard to find. Even Adrian Roland's influence means nothing here."

"The police will come eventually."

"I know." A ruthless glint flashed in his eyes. "That's why we're on a tight schedule."

Her chest tightened. "The hotel proposal benefits everyone—"

"Half the Roland fortune would last me lifetimes, but I've changed my mind." His grin turned feral. "Stay put. Once I'm done, the cops will collect you."

"You still want revenge?"

"Obviously. Pity Adrian couldn't care less about money." He leaned in, venom dripping from his gaze. "His weakness—is you."

That look—like a viper's tongue flickering—made her skin crawl.

"Hurting you is the only way to break him."

She instinctively hugged herself. "What are you planning?"

"Scared? You played brave so well at the hotel." His laugh was icy. "No wonder Adrian developed dissociative identity disorder over you."

"...You won't kill me."

"Wanna bet?" He licked his lips. "Imagine his reaction seeing your severed limbs. Would he snap completely?" Mad laughter erupted from him. "Can't wait."

Stella's face drained of color.

This man had nothing left to lose.

"Eat up. Disgusting as it is, might be your last meal."

The door slammed behind him.

Only his frail adoptive mother remained, gesturing apologetically for her son's behavior.

Stella steadied herself against the wall, finally taking in the cramped space.

A single bed dominated the dirt-floored shack. Piled necessities left no room for personal touches—clearly Vincent's domain.

Across the way, a smaller room reeked of medicinal herbs.

A skeletal old woman coughed violently upon seeing her. "Vincent's wife?"

The adoptive mother nodded vigorously, giving a thumbs-up.

"Sweetheart, what's your name? Not many city girls come to these mountains."

"...Stella."

"Lovely!" The old woman's clouded eyes gleamed. "You weren't trafficked here, were you?"

"We...know each other."

"Good!" She exhaled in relief. "My boy's made it big in the city!"

Stella said nothing.

"We're on borrowed time. Just want to see him settled before—"

BANG!

The door flew open.

"Who said you could come in here?"
###Chapter 388 You Still Love Him

Stella Valentine's wrist trembled violently, nearly knocking over the water glass on the table. "Your mother brought me here."

Vincent Atlante's gaze swept over the elderly couple on the bed, irritation flashing in his eyes. "I didn't tie you up only because your wrist is injured. Stay put. I could find my way around these mountains blindfolded."

Stella pressed her lips together.

Though she had been unconscious during the journey, it had been noon when they left Houston Grand Hotel. Now the sun was setting—they must have traveled for at least five or six hours. Over two hundred kilometers of mountain roads made escape impossible.

"Vincent, don't be so harsh," the old man rasped. "With our family's situation, any girl willing to be with you is a blessing."

Vincent scoffed and pulled a tube of ointment from his pocket, tossing it to Stella. "Burn ointment. You'll need those hands for your designs."

Stella froze. "You—"

"Enough." He cut her off sharply, kicking open the rickety wooden door with a screech.

"Don't be afraid, dear. Vincent just has a sharp tongue," the old man coughed. "He's never been good with words."

The mute woman beside him nodded vigorously.

"Have you... seen a doctor?"

"We have." The old man smiled bitterly. "We've been everywhere—Houston, even the capital. Vincent spent every penny he earned, but this illness..." He shook his head. "It's a bottomless pit."

Stella's heart clenched.

Now she understood why Vincent had chosen this moment for revenge.

These two were his only tether to the world. With their time running out, he had nothing left to lose.

"Uncle Vincent..."

"My surname is Lee," the old man sighed. "Vincent knew he wasn't our biological son by the time he was five or six. That boy has always been too clever..."

Stella tightened her grip on the ointment. Finally, she recognized the source of the emptiness in Vincent's eyes—it wasn't hatred, but the void of being abandoned by the entire world.

Outside, Vincent chewed on a blade of grass, staring at the sky.

"I'll let you go," he said abruptly. "But not now."

"Why?"

He smirked. "Do all rich people ask stupid questions? I show mercy, and you demand reasons?"

Stella stepped beside him. "I thought you'd hate me more."

"Hate you?" He spat out the grass. "Rape you first, then kill you?"

"At least you wouldn't have specifically..." She waved the ointment.

"Told you I didn't buy it." Vincent narrowed his eyes. "Just picked it up along the way."

"Stole it?"

"The clerk chased me halfway down the street." He pointed to the black Lexus outside. "See that? Adrian Roland's car. This face has its perks—the hotel handed over the keys without a fuss."

License plate 0826—her birthday.

"Heard he had a garage full of Porsches?" Vincent asked suddenly.

"Sold them."

"For you?"

Stella's breath hitched.

Vincent laughed. "Stella, you've changed."

"What?"

"You still love him." He turned, his shadow engulfing her. "Or you wouldn't instinctively defend him. Women..."

The evening wind scattered dried leaves as Stella clenched the ointment in her hand.

The stolen burn cream burned her palm like fire.
###Chapter 389 Wait for Me

Stella Valentine bit her lower lip until it turned white, her fingertips trembling slightly.

"Pity. He won't live much longer." Vincent Atlante squinted at the dying sunset. "If you don't apply the ointment soon, the wound will scab over."

She silently twisted open the medicine jar, spreading the cool salve over her swollen wrist.

A sudden force yanked her backward.

Click—

A blinding camera flash erupted, then vanished just as quickly.

"Relax. Just keeping a memento." Vincent scrolled through his phone gallery with a smirk. "Beautiful women always photograph well."

Stella instantly understood. "You're using these photos to lure Adrian here."

"Too messy to make a move in the city. Easier to let him walk into the trap himself."

"Do you really have to kill him?"

"My entire life was destroyed. Someone has to pay." Venom dripped from his words. "His parents are dead. The old man's on his last breath. Adrian's the only one left to settle this debt."

"Uncle Roland and the others were deceived by Victor too!" she pleaded.

"Don't worry. None of them will escape."

"Vincent, isn't it better to let go and start fresh?"

"Start fresh?" He seized her chin, fingers digging in. "My life was shredded to pieces long ago!"

"But—"

"Shut up!" He flung her aside. "Don't think agreeing to release you gives you the right to lecture me. Remember your place, Miss Valentine—you're just bait."

A shrill ringtone shattered the tension.

"How prompt." Vincent whistled. "Seems Mr. Roland is in quite the hurry."

He answered with mocking cheer. "Like the photos? Sunset and beauty—such poetic composition."

Adrian's voice came through gritted teeth: "I'm coming. Don't you dare touch her."

"What if I already did?" Vincent taunted. "A hug? A kiss? What's the big deal?"

"Vincent! You're dead!"

"Sent you the coordinates." A lighter flickered in Vincent's grasp, flames dancing in his pupils. "Before dawn. We end this."

Stella grabbed his sleeve. "What are you planning?"

He pointed toward the ink-black mountains. "To make him disappear. Without a trace."

Her blood turned to ice.

"Say your goodbyes." Vincent shoved the phone at her and locked the door behind him.

"Stella?" Adrian's voice was achingly tender through the receiver.

Her tears splattered against the screen. "Adrian..."

"Don't cry. I'll be there soon." His whisper could shatter hearts. "No matter what happens, stay alive."

"You...don't mind?"

"Losing you is the only thing I can't survive." A bitter laugh. "Not like I have long anyway."

Paper rustled in the background.

"Listen carefully. Tomorrow when Vincent leaves, run east five hundred meters to the convenience store. Charlie will be waiting."

His words accelerated.

"Take care of Grandpa and the kids when you get back. If...if you meet someone..."

His voice fractured.

"Never mind. I take it back." Self-mocking humor laced his tone. "We married twice—once with papers but no ceremony, once with a wedding but no license. That counts as complete, right?"

The night wind carried away her stifled sobs.

"Stella, some things need saying before it's too late."

An engine roared to life.

"I've loved you. Always."
###Chapter 390: Almost Tempted to Let You Two Be

The moment she hung up, Stella Valentine's fingers trembled slightly.

She couldn't bear to imagine Adrian Roland's expression upon hearing those words.

With a violent motion, she flung her phone into the distant wasteland. It traced a silver arc under the moonlight.

The silence was suffocating, broken only by the rustling of dry grass in the wind.

Vincent Atlante was right—this truly was a place where no one would hear her screams.

The harsh glow from the cabin's windows pierced the darkness.

When she pushed the door open, Vincent lounged against the headboard, flipping through a garishly covered book.

The pink title "CEO's Runaway Bride" glared obnoxiously.

"Finished?" he asked without looking up.

Stella stared at the book, her brow furrowing involuntarily.

"What?" Vincent snapped it shut, smirking. "Think I shouldn't read this trash?"

She averted her gaze and perched on a small stool in the corner.

"Tossed your phone?" he suddenly asked.

Her fingers twisted together instinctively.

"Knew it." He snorted. "Would say anything to keep him away, wouldn't you? Hate him? Never forgive him?"

Her lips pressed into a bloodless line.

"Women." Vincent shook his head in mock admiration. "Hearts full of love, mouths full of venom."

"I just..." Stella hesitated. "...don't want the children to lose their father."

Vincent abruptly sat upright, eyes narrowing dangerously. "Not afraid I'll snap?"

"You said you don't hit women."

"Unless you cross me."

Her lashes lowered. "I am afraid."

"Then why—"

"But I'm more afraid something will happen to him."

Vincent studied her for a long moment before bursting into laughter. "Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!" He slapped his thigh. "Did you really tell him you'd fallen for me?"

She gave a slight nod.

"I knew it!" Rubbing his hands gleefully, he crowed, "Two idiots, made for each other."

......

Dawn's pale light crept across the sky when a shrill ringtone shattered the stillness.

Stella jolted awake.

Vincent leisurely retrieved another phone, his smirk triumphant.

"Here already?" he drawled into the receiver. "Fine, I'll bring her over... Hahaha, Adrian, your little star was quite... enthusiastic last night..."

She bit her lower lip until it bled.

"Impatient?" Vincent deliberately raised his voice. "Our tastes always did run similar..."

Hanging up, he stretched lazily. "Let's go meet your beloved."

His jeans pockets were conspicuously empty.

Stella exhaled silently in relief.

"Looking for something?" Vincent suddenly loomed over her. "A weapon?"

"Where is he?"

"Nearby hillside." His grin widened. "Specially asked me not to tell you."

Of course he'd come.

Vincent's arm snaked around her waist, reeking of tobacco.

"Almost moves me," he whispered against her ear. "Maybe I should... let you two be?"

Her body turned to stone. "Since when are you merciful?"

"Never." His laughter rang hollow. "Just thought of something funnier—making him wish he were dead."

"He's already—"

"Not enough!" Vincent's grip turned vicious. "This is nothing! I want him to taste every humiliation I endured!"

Stella struggled. "His mind is already broken!"

"Perfect." His smile turned feral. "Miss Valentine... ever done any acting?"
###Chapter 391: My Life for Your Forgiveness

"What do you mean by that?"

"You reminded me. There's no greater torment than watching the woman you love fall into another man's arms."

Stella Valentine's pupils constricted. "You— Ah!"

The arm around her waist tightened painfully, squeezing the breath from her lungs. "Let's go. If you perform well, I might leave his body intact."

Dragged forward against her will, she stumbled out of the courtyard.

Dawn had yet to break. Mountain mist swirled around them, veiling everything in haze.

Yet she recognized him instantly.

Adrian Roland clearly recognized her too.

Their eyes met—and he froze as if struck by lightning.

She felt his gaze trail slowly down her face before settling on her waist, where Vincent Atlante's hand gripped her possessively.

He hadn't driven here. The familiar MV Agusta Brutale stood nearby. His hospital gown hung loosely from his frame, the casts on his limbs gone. Empty sleeves fluttered in the wind, and hospital slippers remained on his feet.

His lips moved, forming silent words.

The howling wind drowned them out. Vincent sneered, "What did he say?"

Stella turned her face away. "Nothing."

"Your little secret?"

"...He congratulated me."

Vincent's grin widened. "Does it hurt?"

"Shut up..."

"Begging requires the right attitude. You should be weeping, pleading for me to spare him."

"Would it work?"

"How would you know unless you try?"

"Then I beg you—"

"Begging won't change anything." Vincent laughed cruelly. "You're so naive, little girl."

"The only man I've ever loved is Adrian Roland."

"First love? No wonder you can't let go."

Her voice trembled. "Can't you spare him?"

"No." His answer was absolute. "He dies today."

Stella closed her eyes in despair.

"Not going to keep begging?"

"You won't agree anyway."

Vincent pulled her closer, laughing. "Let's go. Your man's been watching us long enough—his heart must be bleeding by now."

He deliberately pressed Stella against him as they approached Adrian.

Adrian's gaze burned like a brand, but she couldn't meet it, turning her face away.

"Mr. Roland honors his word." Vincent stopped before him. "Didn't even bring a car."

Adrian finally tore his eyes from Stella. "I agreed to your terms. What now?"

Vincent pointed toward the distant cliff. "Little Star accidentally dropped my phone down there. Be a gentleman and fetch it."

Adrian's brow furrowed. "This is between us. Let's talk elsewhere."

Vincent considered it. "Fine."

"Wait!" Stella grabbed Vincent's arm. "I'm coming too."

He raised an eyebrow. "Afraid he'll hurt me? Mr. Roland isn't that kind of man."

"I don't trust this."

Vincent spread his hands at Adrian. "Women and their fears."

Adrian didn't look at her. "Let's go."

The three reached the cliff's edge.

A frigid wind howled. Stella shivered.

Adrian instinctively moved to remove his coat, then remembered he wore only a hospital gown. Still, his fingers went to the buttons.

"Don't." She stopped him.

Vincent tightened his hold. "This should keep you warm, yes?"

"...Yes."

She retreated half a step. Her peripheral vision caught Adrian's collar blowing open, revealing his bare chest.

He made no move to fix it, smiling bitterly instead. "If I die today... will you forgive me?"

Vincent scoffed. "Obviously."

"I was asking Stella." Adrian's gaze burned. "I nearly killed you years ago. Now I repay that debt with my life. Would that... earn your forgiveness?"

Vincent cut in, "Dead men don't need forgiveness."

"My conscience is clear—except regarding her." Adrian's voice roughened. "Not for this life. Only the next. Stella, let's start over in our next life."

Vincent sneered. "Next life? Who believes in that?"

"If I believe, it exists."

"Mr. Roland came prepared, I see."

Adrian's throat worked. He seemed to wrestle with words before addressing Vincent. "Grandfather hasn't long. I'll repay what the Rolands owe you. Victor Lefèvre is at my villa—do as you please with him. As for the assets—"

"Transferred to me?"

"No." Adrian met his gaze squarely. "They're divided among my three children. You may access the funds only if you treat Stella and them well. Otherwise, you get nothing."
###Chapter 392: The Madman

"The assets will be divided equally among the three children."

The words cut through Vincent Atlante's fake smile like a knife.

The mountain wind howled. Stella Valentine shivered involuntarily, wrapping her arms around herself. Her heart pounded so hard it threatened to burst from her chest.

Vincent's eyes darkened. "I knew you wouldn't give in so easily."

Adrian Roland's lips curved slightly. "Likewise. You claim not to care about the money, yet your true colors show when you can't get it."

"Twins are fascinating." Vincent's grin turned vicious. "You share memories but can't hide your greed."

Adrian glanced at the distant woods. "Is that the grave you picked for me?"

"Do you like it? Scenic, with a view of the stars." Vincent spread his arms theatrically. "Considerate of me, isn't it?"

"Nice spot. Just too remote."

"What, you'd prefer to die downtown?"

"Don't you want the world to know Vincent Atlante existed before you kill me?"

Vincent threw his head back in laughter. "Of course! But the scene might be too bloody for children."

Adrian only smiled faintly.

Suddenly, Vincent's expression shifted back to casual indifference. "Since you're here, stay for dinner." He yanked Stella to his side. "Make your brother-in-law a proper last meal."

Stella stood frozen.

"Daydreaming?" Vincent tightened his grip on her shoulder.

Adrian's low voice cut in. "Go ahead. Make something simple. Be careful not to burn yourself."

"You've been smoking." Stella's question came out abruptly.

Adrian sniffed his sleeve. "The wind should've blown the scent away by now."

"It's your voice..." She trailed off.

That rough yet tender tone—it sounded just like Mr. Alistair.

"Sorry. I promised I'd quit." His smile was bitter.

Stella remembered the cigarette butts under the streetlamp at the Roland estate. She knew Adrian too well. If he was sending her away, he had something important to discuss with Vincent.

But she worried about his injuries.

"It's fine." His gaze softened.

Vincent studied them with narrowed eyes. "Flirting right in front of me? Yesterday you claimed to love me. Changed your mind already?"

"My feelings for him died long ago." Stella's voice was ice. "Adrian, leave. I won't cook for you. I don't want to see you again."

"Do you really love him?" Adrian's voice trembled.

"Even if it's not him, it would never be you." She turned away. "Just give Vincent his share. The children only need yours."

Vincent hauled her against him roughly. "Not cooking for the CEO? At least make something for your man." He dragged her toward the cottage. "Wait here, Mr. Roland."

Back inside, Stella braced for violence—but Vincent pulled a coil of rope from the kitchen.

"Tying me up again?" She stepped back.

"Want Adrian to live?" Vincent's eyes gleamed.

Her chest tightened. "What do you mean?"

"You die. He lives." He toyed with the rope. "Nothing hurts more than losing the one you love. Your act earlier was decent, but not enough. Only your death will haunt him forever."

"You're insane."

"Insanely brilliant." Vincent began counting down. "Thirty seconds. Choose."

"That grove of trees..." Realization dawned. "You're going to burn him alive?"

"With his broken leg, he can't run." Vincent smirked. "Even if you call the police now, he'll be ashes before the fire trucks arrive."

Stella nodded slowly. "Same for me. Too late for help. He'll have to watch me die."

"Smart. But I'm democratic. If you refuse, I won't force—"

"I'll go."

Vincent blinked. "You're sure?"

Stella extended her wrists. "I'm a cancer patient. Relapse could happen anytime. Adrian's different. Thousands rely on him for their livelihoods. His grandfather is waiting."

"Last chance—"

"Tie me."
###Chapter 393: Farewell, Miss Stella

When Vincent Atlante dragged Stella Valentine deep into the woods, she finally understood his plan.

He had chosen this location deliberately.

The hill where Adrian Roland sat provided a clear view of the entire forest.

But with both legs broken, he could barely stand—let alone come to her rescue.

Vincent had even calculated the timing.

Even if Adrian called the police immediately, the distance from downtown Houston was too great. The maze of winding roads would delay any rescue until it was too late.

"How amusing you two are." Vincent bound her to a tree with rough rope, his lips curling in mockery. "He'd die for you, and you'd push him away to save him. How pathetic—"

"Jealousy doesn't suit you," Stella interrupted coldly.

"Ridiculous!" He yanked the rope tighter. "I'm just here to witness your stupidity."

"At least we have someone willing to die for us." She lifted her chin. "You'll never know that kind of love."

Vincent's eyes darkened. "So the obedient act is over?"

"Why pretend when I'm about to die?"

"Curse all you want." He stepped back to admire his handiwork. "Adrian's suffering brings me joy. I should thank you both for the inspiration."

Stella thrashed against the ropes, making the tree shudder, but the bindings held firm.

Her hope dwindled with each failed attempt.

"I hadn't planned to involve you." Vincent brushed dirt from his hands. "You walked into this yourself."

Retreating several paces, he flashed a cruel smile. "Farewell, Miss Stella."

...

When Vincent returned to the hill, Adrian still leaned against the same tree.

A yellowed paper trembled in his grip.

"What's that?" Vincent narrowed his eyes.

Adrian carefully unfolded it. "Stella's birthday wish list."

"What nonsense is this?"

"She wrote it years ago." His fingers traced the fragile page. "I promised to fulfill every item."

Vincent scoffed. "Rich people's games."

"Perhaps." Adrian's voice softened. "She wanted a dog. Sunflowers. To cook for me."

"How sentimental."

"I loved that about her." A bitter smile touched his lips. "When she changed... that was my fault."

Vincent suddenly remembered. "That Samoyed—"

"And seeing snow in Houston."

"It never snows there!"

"But I made it happen." Adrian gazed into the distance. "A mercy from heaven."

Vincent waved impatiently. "Any more absurdities?"

Adrian read the final item. "She wanted me to give her a star."

"...You didn't actually—"

"I named a minor planet after her." His voice broke. "Never got to tell her..."

Vincent burst into laughter. "Now you never will!"

He pointed toward the woods.

Flames had already reached the tree line, advancing in a deadly ring.

Adrian's face drained of color. "What have you done?!"

"Guess."

Adrian tried to stand but collapsed.

"Save your strength." Vincent looked down at him. "Enjoy the fireworks."

"Vincent!!!"

"Revenge tastes sweet."

"Take me instead! Spare her!"

"Only her death will destroy you!" Vincent sneered. "Blame your own love."

Adrian fumbled for his phone with shaking hands.

Vincent watched in amusement.

Just as predicted, the broken man couldn't even kneel.

"Why not crawl?" Vincent crouched beside him, malice dripping from every word. "Let's see who's faster—you or the fire."
###Chapter 394: I Can't Even Save Myself

The thick smoke stung her eyes shut.

Stella Valentine's throat burned with each breath, as if swallowing razor blades. She twisted her wrists violently against the coarse ropes, feeling them bite deeper into her flesh. Blood dripped from her fingertips.

A shard of glass sliced fresh wounds into her palm.

She'd stolen it when Vincent Atlante wasn't looking—shattering a liquor bottle and hiding the sharpest fragment in her sleeve. Now it was her only hope.

The inferno grew hotter.

Scorching waves seared her cheeks. She had to cut free before the flames consumed her—or the impending explosion tore them all apart.

Then she noticed something odd about the ground.

Dark tarps peeked through the dirt, arranged in a perfect circle around them. The realization hit like ice water.

Gunpowder.

That acrid scent from firecrackers after New Year's celebrations.

Vincent never intended to burn them alive. This was a bomb.

"Stella..."

A weak voice carried through the smoke.

She looked up to see Adrian Roland collapsed nearby, his body drenched in blood. He struggled to rise, his injured leg buckling with every movement. Beads of sweat rolled down his ashen face.

"Stay back!" she screamed. "You can't help me!"

Adrian gave a pained smile. "I know... I can't even save myself."

He fell again, then forced himself upright.

"I just wanted... to be with you."

Flames licked at his hospital gown, igniting the fabric. Stella turned away, unable to watch.

"Go." Her voice cracked. "I'd rather die alone."

He froze.

"Please..." Blood welled between her fingers as she clenched the glass shard. "Stay away."

The fire devoured nearby trees, heat blistering her skin. Time was running out. She had to escape before detonation—before everyone here perished.

Including the one person she never wanted to see again.
###Chapter 395: Give Me an Answer, Please

"What did you say?"

"I said, whether you live or die, I never want to see you again!" Stella Valentine's voice was hoarse, her teeth clenched. "Get out! Now!"

Adrian Roland's eyes darkened with unfathomable pain. "You and Vincent... I could tell it wasn't real."

"But it wasn't you either." Stella lifted her chin, her gaze icy. "Adrian, you nearly killed me, then deceived me by pretending to be Mr. Alistair. I will never forgive you."

"But—"

"No buts." She cut him off. "If you want to die, go ahead. Find Vincent or end it yourself—I don’t care. I just pray that in my next life, I stay far away from you. Even if I become a rock or a weed, I never want to meet you again!"

Flames devoured most of his hospital gown, licking hungrily at his back.

Stella turned her face away. "I’m begging you—stay away from me."

"..."

Adrian remained silent, but she couldn’t bring herself to meet his eyes.

He suddenly let out a low, bitter laugh. "Fine, I’ll go. But, little star, answer me one last question."

"Speak."

"Did you mean it when you said you loved Vincent?"

"..."

"I’m about to die. Give me an answer."

In the distance, sirens wailed, growing louder—police cars and fire trucks.

Firefighters?

Stella froze. If they could control the flames before the explosion...

"Anyone here?"
"Is there anyone inside?"

Rescue teams!

"Here! We're here!" she screamed.

"Stay down! Wait for help!"

Thick smoke began to fill the air as the temperature dropped. Jets of water sprayed from all directions.

A rescuer untied her restraints. "Can you walk?"

"I'm fine!" She pointed at Adrian. "He needs emergency care!"

"Don’t worry, the ambulance is right outside."

As Adrian was carried away on a stretcher, she stumbled after them.

"Be careful," she warned. "There are explosives in the woods."

"Explosives?"

"I smelled gunpowder."

"Understood. Let’s get you out first."

When they emerged from the trees, she saw Vincent Atlante restrained by police.

He tilted his head and grinned at her. "Impressive, Miss Valentine. When did you call the cops?"

Stella's voice was cold. "It's over."

"Over?" Vincent's smile twisted into something unsettling. "This is just the beginning."

Her chest tightened. "What do you mean?"

He patted his chest. "Take a guess?"

His jacket bulged unnaturally.

Unless...

A chill ran down Stella's spine. "What are you planning?"

"My brother asked why we shouldn’t go out with a bang." Vincent's eyes gleamed with madness. "So I thought—why not?"
###Chapter 396: She Would Never Mistake Her Husband

"Stop!" Stella Valentine's blood ran cold.

Vincent Atlante stood flanked by two officers, his lips curling into a sinister smirk no one noticed. All eyes were drawn to the roaring flames in the distance and Adrian Roland lying motionless in a pool of blood.

"If I'm going down, I'm taking others with me," Vincent sneered.

Stella stepped forward, voice barely above a whisper. "I can offer you a way out."

"You?" His eyes narrowed.

"Not a plea." She met his gaze. "A deal."

Before he could respond, a female officer rushed over. "Ms. Valentine? Are you alright?"

"I'm fine."

The officer exhaled in relief. "We need your help identifying them. The two Mr. Rolands look identical—"

Vincent suddenly slung an arm around Stella's shoulders. "Sweetheart, the kids are waiting for us."

Her body stiffened.

His fingers traced her back, pressing deliberately against the detonator concealed beneath her clothes.

"This is..." The officer hesitated. "Ms. Valentine, could you—?"

Every eye at the scene fixed on Stella. She clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

"How many years for arson and theft?" she asked abruptly.

The officer blinked. "At least twenty, combined. Why do you—"

"Just curious what my husband's brother will face."

Vincent tightened his grip, crushing her against him. Through the fabric, she felt the cold metal box pressing into her ribs.

"Don't be scared," he cooed, fingers applying dangerous pressure.

Stella shuddered.

"Oh! So you're the real Mr. Roland." The officer nodded in realization. "Then the other one is...?"

Vincent smiled politely. "My twin. Mentally unstable. Apologies for the trouble."

He forced Stella's face into his smoke-scented jacket. Her hand inched toward the device that could obliterate them all.

"We'll come by tomorrow for statements," Vincent told the police. "My wife's had quite a shock tonight."

The officer studied Stella uncertainly. "Ms. Valentine, are you sure—?"

Vincent's grip turned vicious.

"Yes..." Her voice trembled. "He's my husband."
###Chapter 397: Let Me See Him One Last Time

"That's my brother." Vincent Atlante's lips curved into a gentle smile, but his tone carried unshakable resolve. "We're identical twins, but he was sent away as a child. We only recently reunited. I never imagined he'd do something like this..."

The female officer's expression cleared with understanding. "No wonder you look exactly alike."

"Family matters should stay private. I'd appreciate your discretion." Vincent gave a slight nod, every movement exuding the authority of the Roland family's leader.

The officer hesitated. "But your brother's crimes are serious. I'm afraid—"

"How long is the sentence?" Vincent cut in.

"At least ten years."

The delicate figure in his arms trembled violently.

Vincent tightened his hold without a word, pressing a kiss to her hair. "Don't be afraid. Let's go home to the children. Officer, are we free to leave?"

"Miss Valentine needs to sign the paperwork." The officer extended the documents.

Vincent slid the papers toward Stella Valentine, his voice deceptively tender. "Sign it, little star."

Her tears splashed onto the page, blurring the ink.

Ten years.

With this signature, Adrian Roland would spend a decade behind bars.

But if she exposed Vincent now, with all these witnesses...

"Little star?" Vincent forced the pen into her shaking fingers, whispering against her ear. "Think of the children. Three... two..."

"I'll sign!"

She scrawled her name, the jagged letters mirroring her shattered heart.

"How considerate of Mr. Roland," murmured an envious voice in the crowd.

Vincent tucked away the documents with satisfaction, steering her toward the exit.

"Wait!" Stella suddenly clutched his sleeve, her voice breaking. "Let me see him... just once..."

Vincent's eyes turned glacial. "Remember your place."

"The papers are signed. What are you afraid of?" Her red-rimmed eyes pleaded. "He's going to prison..."

His only response was shoving her roughly into the car.

The door slammed shut.

"Vincent!" She pounded on the window.

"Quiet." He hit the accelerator. "I'll arrange a visit before he's transferred."

"You're pathetic."

Vincent chuckled. "I'm the CEO of Roland Group now. Pathetic?"

"Karma will find you."

"By the time Adrian gets out, the Rolands will be hollowed out." A thought struck him. "Ah, those assets transferred to the children..."

"Over my dead body!" Stella snapped.

"Then his time in prison..." Vincent drew out the words meaningfully. "I have many 'old friends' inside."

She shook with rage. "You're vile!"

"Blame yourself for being his weakness." His eyes crinkled in amusement. "Torturing you is more fun than killing him."

Before he finished, Stella lunged for his chest.

Tires screeched as Vincent seized her wrist. "Trying to die?"

"Hurt him," she hissed, "and we'll go down together."

"You?"

"Ten years is long enough to find my chance." Her gaze was razor-sharp. "Test me."

Vincent studied her for a long moment before laughing. "Drive."
###Chapter 398 Divine Intervention

Vincent Atlante lounged in the car seat with a lazy smirk. "Quite the temper you've got."

"Got a problem with that?"

"Wouldn't dare. Thanks to your cooperation today, Ms. Valentine. Feel free to snap at me all you want."

He carelessly undid the top two buttons of his shirt, revealing his collarbones.

Stella Valentine recoiled, her fingers already gripping the door handle.

Vincent seized her wrist. "Running away?"

"You—"

Following her terrified gaze downward, he snorted. "Overthinking it. Just wanted a smoke."

He pulled a crumpled cigarette pack from his inner pocket, expertly fishing one out with his teeth before tossing the pack onto the dashboard. The lighter's flame flared, illuminating his sinister features.

"See clearly now? You're not my type."

Stella trembled. "That's what you were hiding in your chest?"

"What else?" He exhaled a smoke ring, grinning maliciously. "A guy who can't even afford meds—where would I get money for explosives?"

"Then the black powder in the woods—"

"Coal dust mixed with firecracker residue. Convincing, right?" He stomped on the gas, steering with one hand while waving the cigarette in front of her face with the other. "Never said it was dynamite. That was all your imagination."

"Vincent Atlante!" Her voice turned hoarse. "You planned this from the start! Even if Adrian hadn't been swapped out, you'd have lured him into those woods—"

"Just wanted to scare him at first." His eyes narrowed. "Didn't expect a bonus. Now I don't even need to dispose of a body—he'll rot in prison for ten years. The heavens are on my side."

"I'll go to the police! I'll tell them the truth!"

"Be my guest." He flicked ash. "Don't forget the documents you signed today. I'm the mastermind, and you're my accomplice. As for your three kids... Ms. Valentine, think carefully before acting."

......

The hospital's fluorescent lights stabbed at Adrian Roland's eyes as he lay weakly on the bed, his uninjured hand cuffed to the railing.

"Name."

"Adrian Roland."

"Cut the crap. Identity theft is a felony."

"I am Adrian Roland."

"Still lying? Mr. and Mrs. Roland just gave their statements."

Adrian forced his eyes open. "Mrs. Roland?"

"Yeah, Ms. Stella Valentine personally confirmed Mr. Roland's identity. What's left to deny?"

"She... is she okay?"

"With Mr. Roland around, what could happen?"

A splitting headache hit him, his vision darkening at the edges.

"What's your real name?"

Who was he?

The shadow who only dared embrace her in the dead of night.

The pitiful creature forever banished from the light.

"I asked you a question!"

"Adrian... the Second."

"Which 'Second'?"

"'When wild geese return under the moonlit tower...'" His voice rasped. "That's what she named me."

"Age."

"Thirty-three."

"Occupation."

"Businessman."

"Relation to Adrian Roland?"

"I am Adrian Roland."

"You just said your name was Adrian the Second!"

"Both names are mine." He shut his eyes in agony. "I have bipolar disorder."

The officers exchanged glances.

"So he's mentally ill..."

"Mr. Roland mentioned this morning—it's his twin brother who was kidnapped as a kid."

"Tragic. Should've been a wealthy heir..."

"Heard he stole to pay for his paralyzed parents' medical bills..."

Their footsteps faded.

Silence reclaimed the room.

Adrian bolted upright.

Stella gave a statement with "Adrian Roland"?

If he was here... who was that "Adrian Roland"?

Impossible...

How could she not recognize him?
###Chapter 399: Truth and Choice

The hospital door creaked open with a soft knock.

A middle-aged doctor in gold-rimmed glasses entered, freezing when he recognized the figure on the bed. "Mr. Roland?"

Adrian looked up. "Dr. Lowell."

"How did you—" The doctor hurried closer, scanning the bandages covering Adrian's body. "Last week's financial news showed you and Ms. Valentine at a charity gala. It's only been days—"

"Which hospital is this?" Adrian interrupted.

"Psychiatric wing of Houston Central."

Adrian smirked. "No wonder it's familiar. Three years ago, I came here for therapy."

Dr. Lowell adjusted his glasses. "The police requested a psychiatric evaluation. They said the suspect might be mentally ill. Mr. Roland, has your condition... relapsed?"

"I just need to confirm something." Adrian turned to the window.

The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the silence.

Two hours later.

Dr. Lowell stared at the test results, brow furrowed.

"Well?" Adrian's voice was eerily calm.

"Professionally, I shouldn't say this..." The doctor took a deep breath. "But your results show no traces of bipolar disorder. Your mental state is more stable than an average person's."

Adrian chuckled. "So?"

"This means you'll face criminal charges—kidnapping, theft, and more." Dr. Lowell lowered his voice. "Minimum ten-year sentence."

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting fractured shadows across the bed.

Adrian suddenly remembered the night Luna moved back to the old house. For the first time in years, he'd slept through the night. The nightmares, the manic depression, the suicidal urges—all vanished as if by magic.

"Dr. Lowell, I remember everything now."

"What?"

"The other personality's memories." Adrian tapped the bedrail. "How I hurt her. And those three months."

The doctor shot to his feet. "That's impossible! The memory barrier between alters is—"

"The car crash." Adrian cut him off. "I recreated our worst accident. First attempt failed, so I tried again. And again..."

His gaze dropped to the cast on his right leg.

Dr. Lowell inhaled sharply. "These injuries..."

The room plunged into silence.

"Too bad remembering changes nothing." Adrian suddenly laughed. "She'd rather claim an imposter as her husband."

The doctor recalled the loving couple from the financial news. "But at the birthday banquet, you two seemed—"

"Convincing performance, wasn't it?" Adrian's eyes turned glacial. "The audience bought it."

A pen hovered over the diagnosis form.

"Should I... contact Ms. Valentine? Explain the truth?" Dr. Lowell ventured. "Prove you're really—"

"She knows." Adrian's voice cracked. "Fourteen years. Over two thousand days. How could she mistake me?"

Understanding dawned on the doctor. "So when she identified you as Adrian Roland, she meant to..."

"Let me take Vincent's place in prison." Adrian stared at the ceiling. "Fair enough. I owe her that."

The sunlight burned his eyes.

The girl who used to smile at him with dimples was truly gone.

The door burst open.

Vincent rushed in, nearly knocking over Dr. Lowell.

"Mr. Roland! I just got the police report—"

"Fingerprint analysis?" Adrian said calmly. "Don't bother."

Vincent's eyes reddened. "But the contract clearly has your—"

"She wants me locked up." Adrian whispered. "Let her have this."

Outside, plane tree leaves spiraled downward.

Just like years ago, when a ponytailed girl hopped through golden leaves.
###Chapter 400: She's Waiting for You to Come Home

"No need." Adrian's gaze lingered on the window, his voice low. "Are Grandpa and the children settled?"

Vincent answered promptly, "They're at your marital home—the villa in the suburbs."

"What reason did you give?"

"I said the old estate needed renovations."

Adrian gave a slight nod. "Well done. What about the police?"

Vincent hesitated. "Mrs. Roland took the impostor to withdraw the kidnapping charges this morning. The case has been dropped."

"Besides kidnapping, what else did he frame her for?"

"Petty theft—medicine, daily necessities, clothes..." Vincent paused. "The most expensive item was a wedding dress. The priciest one in the store."

Adrian shook his head. "He didn't steal that dress."

"Mrs. Roland did?"

"It was me."

Vincent's eyes widened. "You—"

"Have Charlie retrieve it from the hospital storage locker." Adrian cut him off.

Vincent nodded. "I'll contact him right away. That dress is worth a million. Returning it should settle everything else."

"No." Adrian's tone was firm. "Pay for it in full and bring the dress to me."

Vincent opened his mouth but chose to address the immediate task first. "I'll handle it immediately."

His eyes fell on the handcuff around Adrian's wrist, the other end chained to the hospital bed railing.

"Boss..." Vincent clenched his teeth. "I regret not convincing you to listen to Charlie. Those three months, he was by your and Mrs. Roland's side. He knew the situation best."

Adrian chuckled and waved him off.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Here to check if I'm dead yet?" Adrian glanced toward the entrance.

"Among other things." Grant Rubenstein entered with a cane, his gaze sweeping over Adrian's leg. "Now we match. Uncle Xavier would kill me if he knew."

Adrian smirked coldly. "Where did Vincent Atlante come from?"

"Don't blame Uncle Xavier." Grant shook his head. "Vincent sought him out. Uncle only wanted him to drive you two apart. He never expected Vincent to play him too. The man doesn't want money—he wants the entire Roland family."

"The Rolands are beyond his reach."

Grant raised an eyebrow. "Got a plan?"

"Handle with care."

"Understood." Grant nodded. "Having Mrs. Roland in his grasp does complicate things."

"Is our deal still on?"

"Of course." Grant narrowed his eyes. "What do you need? Lure Vincent out?"

"I'll deal with Vincent." Adrian met his gaze. "Your job is to protect Stella and her mother."

Before Grant could respond, Adrian continued, "Your informants dug up how much Uncle Xavier left me. Protecting two people shouldn't be hard."

Grant laughed. "Nothing gets past you."

"I don't care about what you want."

"Never thought we'd work together." Grant sighed.

"Mutual benefit."

......

Two days later.

An officer unlocked his handcuffs. "Mr. Adrian Roland II, the stolen goods have been compensated. The merchants are no longer pressing charges. You're free to go."

Adrian flexed his wrist with a quiet "Hmm."

"Also, we couldn't locate your household registration records. You'll need to complete the paperwork."

"Fine."

The officer took photos for documentation. "Where should we mail the ID once it's ready?"

"I'll collect it myself."

Penny Anderson helped him up, her eyes red. "Boss, I may have wished you'd get hit by a car, but I never meant for this..."

Adrian waved off her concern.

"Don't worry about the company," Penny whispered. "Mrs. Roland is managing everything. She's swamped."

"Vincent?"

"That impostor?" Penny gritted her teeth. "Playing mascot in your office every day, loving every minute of it."

"He hasn't interfered?"

"He obeys Mrs. Roland like a puppet." Penny frowned. "But he seems... content with it."

Adrian's eyes flickered.

Penny leaned closer. "Mrs. Roland asked me to tell you she has no choice. She'll explain everything when you come home. She'll consult you on company matters..." She hesitated. "She and the children are waiting for you."
###Chapter 401: I'm Here to Surrender

"Home?"

Penny Anderson froze. "Sir, which home are you referring to?"

Adrian Roland's gaze darkened.

Penny hesitated before speaking carefully. "Mrs. Roland was worried Vincent might harm the old master and the children, so she's been staying in Room 1231 at the Houston Grand Hotel."

"Is Vincent at the hotel too?"

"No. She had me rent him an apartment near the company." Penny hesitated again. "Sir, what should we do now—"

"To the police station."

Penny's eyes widened. "You're filing a report?"

The man in the wheelchair rasped, "I'm here to surrender."

New Frontier Group CEO's Office.

Stella Valentine stared at her computer screen, fingers tapping the keyboard.

Penny entered with a cup of warm milk. "Ma'am, you should rest."

"He still refuses to see anyone?"

"The boss has locked himself in prison. Even Vincent can't get through to him." Penny sighed. "It's been six months..."

Stella massaged her temples.

"The company can't be left unattended. I won't give Vincent any openings." She took a sip of milk. "Thankfully, we have Vincent and Julian helping..."

The office door burst open.

Joy Fairsprene rushed in, her face pale. "Stella!"

"What's wrong?"

"Mr. Roland..." Joy's voice trembled. "He found out about Vincent and collapsed on the spot. The doctors say..."

Stella shot to her feet—only to sway as darkness clouded her vision.

Penny steadied her.

"The old master wants to see Vincent," Joy said, near tears. "But if that lunatic says something reckless—"

"Joy, find Julian." Stella forced composure. "Have him take men to the estate. If Vincent steps out of line, restrain him."

"Got it!"

"Penny, try the prison again." Stella clenched her fists. "Grandfather Edward is his last living relative..."

"And you?"

"I'll deal with Vincent."

In the adjacent lounge, Vincent lounged on the couch, playing with his phone.

"No." He didn't bother looking up.

Stella's voice turned icy. "Name your terms."

Vincent grinned. "Fifty percent of the shares."

"Forty-nine. I keep controlling interest."

"Deal." He stood. "Let's not keep the old man waiting."

An ambulance idled outside the Roland estate.

Joy hurried over. "Grandfather Edward's condition is worsening..."

"Where's Adrian?"

"No word yet." Julian Valois's voice was grim. "I've stationed men. If Vincent acts up, they'll intervene."

Stella stared down the empty road, biting her lip.

The bedroom smelled of sandalwood incense.

Benjamin Langley's eyes were red-rimmed. "The old master has been holding on..."

Grandfather Edward weakly opened his eyes. "Leave us..."

The moment the door closed, Vincent's smirk vanished.

Five minutes later, a dull thud echoed through the room.

Vincent pulled the door open. "You can come in now."

By the time medical staff rushed in, the heart monitor had flatlined.

No one noticed the wheelchair-bound figure at the gates, his knuckles white as he gripped the armrests.

"Sir..."

"Take me back."

"Aren't you going to see the old master one last time?"

Adrian closed his eyes, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Go."
###Chapter 402: The Forbidden Name

The night was ink-black, enveloping the Roland family estate in deep silence.

Benjamin Langley stood outside the study door, his fingers hovering uncertainly before finally tapping lightly. "Master Adrian, may I have a word?"

The sound of wheelchair wheels approached, and Adrian Roland opened the door himself. His gaunt face looked ghostly pale under the lamplight, though his eyes remained piercingly clear. "What is it, Benjamin?"

Since the old master's passing and Adrian's imprisonment, the loyal butler had aged a decade overnight. He swallowed hard as he regarded the boy he'd raised. "Master Adrian, the three children... I'm afraid these old bones can't keep up anymore."

Adrian's fingers trembled slightly. Having been released from prison barely two weeks prior, still recovering from leg injuries and reeling from Stella's betrayal, he'd failed to notice Benjamin's exhaustion.

"Hire two reliable nannies," he said quietly. "Top market rates."

Relief flickered across Benjamin's face, but concern quickly resurfaced. "The current staff aren't suited for childcare, especially with young Luna and Celeste—"

He cut himself off abruptly. That forbidden name had nearly slipped out again.

Adrian's expression darkened as he wheeled toward the nursery. "Let the children choose."

In the playroom, Ethan was helping his sisters build block towers. At the knock, he bounded to the door while Luna and Celeste remained engrossed in their dollhouse.

"Dad!" Ethan's face lit up. The boy was his father's mirror image—except for those eyes. They always made Adrian's breath catch.

The girls abandoned their toys to cling to his arms, their lashes fluttering like butterflies. "Daddy, when is Mommy coming home?"

The air turned to ice.

Benjamin watched Adrian anxiously. The man's spine went rigid as he avoided their hopeful gazes. "Mommy... is very busy overseas."

Celeste's lower lip quivered, tears pooling. "But we miss her so much..."

Adrian's throat worked as he stroked her hair. "How about the carousel this weekend? We could—"

He broke off abruptly. Every happy memory was intertwined with her. Even after her betrayal, her ghost haunted him relentlessly.

By the block castle, three small heads huddled together. Adrian studied them, voice barely audible. "Grandpa Benjamin needs rest. Would you like a new nanny to play with?"

Three faces fell in unison.

"No!" The protest came in perfect harmony.
###Chapter 403: I Won't Humiliate Myself Again

Adrian Roland tapped his fingers lightly on the wheelchair armrest under the hopeful gazes of his three children.

"The new nanny will paint with you," he softened his voice. "She'll also make your favorite strawberry cake."

Celeste suddenly threw her teddy bear on the floor, her eyes instantly reddening. "I don't want cake! I want Mommy!"

Ethan immediately picked up the teddy and tucked it back into his sister's arms before turning to his father. "Dad, when is Mommy coming home?"

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed.

He remembered the phone call Julian Valois had relayed three days ago. Stella Valentine had asked to see the children—without mentioning him once.

Luna timidly tugged his sleeve. "Daddy...did we do something wrong? Is that why Mommy won't come back?"

The words stabbed through Adrian's heart. He lifted his youngest daughter onto his lap but couldn't find an answer.

Benjamin Langley entered the nursery with warm milk and sighed at the scene. "Young master, children need their mother."

"What they need is a home that won't abandon them again," Adrian said coldly.

Ethan suddenly stepped in front of his sisters. "Dad, if you and Mommy had a fight, I can talk to her."

Seeing his son's stubborn expression, Adrian glimpsed his younger self. He reached out to ruffle Ethan's hair, but the boy dodged.

"Young master," Benjamin lowered his voice, "Stella genuinely wants to return this time."

The electric wheelchair hummed softly as Adrian turned toward the door. "Benjamin, take them to wash up."

The hallway sconces stretched his shadow long across the wall. As the study door closed, Celeste's muffled sobs followed him: "I want Mommy..."

The computer screen illuminated a family photo on the desktop—Stella holding Luna and Celeste, her smile radiant.

His phone vibrated. An unknown number:
[Tomorrow, 3 PM. Our usual place.]

Adrian's grip tightened. That café was where they'd had their first date.

Benjamin entered quietly, finding him staring at the phone. "Young master?"

"Tell the children," Adrian powered off the phone, "I'm taking them to the amusement park tomorrow."

"What about the new nanny—"

"Postpone it." His gaze drifted to the dark window. "Let's wait a little longer."

Benjamin hesitated but finally nodded. At the door, he heard Adrian murmur:

"One last time."

In the nursery, Ethan was reading to his sisters when Luna suddenly looked up. "Will Mommy come tomorrow?"

Closing the book, Ethan ruffled her hair like their father would. "If we keep waiting, Mommy will come back."

Outside, a shooting star streaked across the night sky.
###Chapter 404: Strictly Business

Benjamin worked swiftly. Within five days, he had shortlisted a group of nanny candidates. He placed a neatly stacked pile of resumes on Adrian Roland's desk.

Adrian's slender fingers flipped through the top resume. The master's degree in education made him raise an eyebrow. "Have all their backgrounds been thoroughly vetted?"

Benjamin stood respectfully nearby. "Rest assured, young master. We contacted only the top domestic service agencies this time. When they heard it was for the Roland children, they took it very seriously."

He paused before adding, "Each candidate has undergone three rounds of background checks."

Adrian's gaze shifted between the documents and resumes. Finally, he closed the folder. "Narrow it down to the five most suitable. I'll make the final decision."

Benjamin exhaled silently, his hidden hands finally relaxing. He discreetly wiped his sweaty palms. "Understood. I'll handle it immediately."

Leaving the study, Benjamin pulled one resume from the stack. The woman in the photo had delicate features—it was Stella Valentine.

"Little Star, now it's up to fate," Benjamin murmured with a sigh.

Stella had exhausted herself applying to every domestic service agency in the city. When she submitted her resume, the HR manager eyed her skeptically. "Ms. Valentine, with your qualifications... as a nanny?"

Only when someone recognized her as Adrian's ex-wife did the company reluctantly accept her application. But her resume was immediately rejected in the first round—no one dared risk angering Adrian.

"Benjamin, please," Stella stood at the entrance of the Roland estate, her eyes slightly red. "Just give me one more chance."

Seeing her gaunt face, Benjamin's heart softened. "I can only include your resume. The rest is..."

"I understand," Stella interrupted. "Whatever the outcome, I'll always be grateful to you."

Fate seemed to side with Stella. Adrian was preoccupied with a corporate crisis and didn't scrutinize every resume. Stella's educational background and childcare experience secured her a spot in the final interview round.

On interview day, five candidates sat in the Roland living room. Stella clenched the hem of her dress, her heart pounding.

The sound of wheelchair wheels approached.

Adrian's gaze froze the moment he saw her. The air turned thick with tension.

"Why is she here?" His voice was icy.

The other four candidates exchanged glances, all eyes shifting to Stella.

"I applied through proper channels," Stella met his gaze steadily, her voice calm.

Adrian studied her briefly before turning to the others. "Let's begin the interviews."

He picked up a resume at random. "Ms. Emily, please introduce yourself first."

Emily stood confidently, detailing her studies in Europe. But Adrian's attention kept drifting to the corner.

Stella sat quietly, until suddenly, she looked up.

Their eyes locked.

Time seemed to stand still.
###Chapter 405 Mr. Roland and Ms. Valentine

The interviews with the other four candidates concluded quickly.

Adrian Roland found his gaze drawn back to Stella Valentine.

She stood before the projector, posture straight as bamboo. Her calm voice detailed parenting philosophies with measured grace. Even hearing those familiar virtues from her lips still stirred something within him.

Unlike the other candidates reciting textbook answers, she spoke of intimate details from their children's lives. The bedtime stories Luna requested, strategies for Celeste's picky eating, Ethan's study habits—each observation revealed a mother's devotion.

Adrian noticed she'd grown thinner. The delicate wrists he remembered now showed prominent bones. Yet her eyes still sparkled like stars, transporting him back to their first meeting years ago.

He snapped the folder shut.

"Benjamin," he murmured, "escort everyone to the lounge."

The others followed the butler out, leaving Stella alone. Her fingertips traced the familiar contours of the sofa arm as she surveyed the unchanged living room.

Benjamin cracked open the nursery door.

"Children," he whispered, "your mother is here."

Celeste leapt up first, toys clattering to the floor. "Really? Mama's really back?"

Ethan feigned composure though his ears flushed red. "Come on," he said, grasping both sisters' hands. Three small figures barreled into the living room like a whirlwind.

The sudden impact nearly knocked Stella off balance as three koala-like children clung to her.

"Mama, I missed you so much," Celeste muffled into her neck. "I thought you left us forever."

Stella knelt, gathering them close. Strawberry shampoo from Celeste's hair, crayon wax on Luna's dress, sunshine clinging to Ethan's collar—she inhaled their scents like oxygen.

"How could I ever leave you?" Her voice trembled.

Luna tilted her face upward. "Mama, stay this time? Please?"

Stella's lips parted. Her gaze traveled over their heads to Adrian in his wheelchair.

"Ms. Valentine," his voice cut like ice, "you weren't selected."

The words cleaved through the tender moment. Adrian turned away, Adam's apple bobbing. "You need to leave."

She felt Ethan's grip tighten on her blouse.

"Mr. Roland," she met his gaze squarely, "I'm their mother. I have visitation rights."

"That's all you are."

"Then tell me," she stepped forward, "why am I unqualified as their nanny? Beyond academic credentials, how do those women surpass me?"

She knew him too well. The minute his brows furrowed, she anticipated every syllable before it left his lips.

The man in the wheelchair finally turned. When their eyes locked, Stella saw storms raging in his gaze.

Luna and Celeste had already swarmed their father, each clinging to an arm.

"Daddy," Luna cupped his face with small hands, "don't be mad at Mama, okay?"

Celeste climbed into his lap like a kitten nestling close. "You're the best daddy. Let Mama stay?"

Adrian sighed helplessly under their assault. When he looked up, Stella was whispering to Ethan, her gentle expression unchanged from years past.

The sight constricted his chest.

"Children," he massaged his temples, "some matters aren't as simple as you think."

Celeste pouted. "Then let Ethan explain! He's the smartest!"

Ethan clung to Stella's hand, small face set in stubborn determination.

As Stella smoothed her son's hair, her eyes remained locked with Adrian's across the room. An invisible wire stretched taut between them, vibrating with unspoken tension.
###Chapter 406: I Will Rise Again

Ethan had a sudden idea. He grabbed Stella Valentine's hand and pulled her toward the bedroom.

"Mommy, we want to sleep with you tonight!" He deliberately raised his voice so Adrian Roland would hear.

Luna and Celeste immediately caught on, fluttering around Adrian like little butterflies.

Adrian's wheelchair remained still. His fingers tapped absently on the armrests.

Stella was swept into the bedroom by the children. As she closed the door, she couldn't help glancing back.

In the living room, Adrian's silhouette looked unbearably lonely.

"Daddy's the best!" Luna and Celeste cheered before scampering away.

Adrian forced a smile and wheeled himself out of the living room.

He didn't see Stella watching him through the crack in the door, her gaze lingering.

"Mommy, what are you looking at?" Ethan tugged at her sleeve.

Stella turned away. "Nothing."

She bent to pick up Celeste, while Luna immediately clung to her leg.

"Mommy, you're not leaving again, are you?" Ethan looked up at her.

Celeste buried her face in Stella's neck. "I don't want presents. Just you."

"I want a princess story!" Luna blinked her big eyes. "Ethan only tells monster-fighting ones. Not romantic at all."

Stella laughed, pinching her daughter's cheek. "Alright, tonight it's Sleeping Beauty."

The three children cheered like a flock of happy sparrows.

Benjamin Langley stood at the hallway corner, watching the scene with quiet satisfaction.

He turned toward the sitting room where the four candidates waited. "Thank you for your time. The decision has been made."

Emily sighed. "It was always going to be her. Mr. Roland didn't even look at her, but he was wound tighter than a bowstring."

In the study, Adrian stared blankly out the window.

"Master, it was my presumption." Benjamin entered. "Punish me if you must."

Adrian turned his wheelchair. "The candidates are gone?"

At Benjamin's nod, his entire body visibly relaxed.

"Master, you look unwell." Benjamin frowned with concern.

"It's nothing." Adrian rubbed his temples. "Tell Ms. Valentine her only duty is caring for the children. She may use any resource in the house."

Benjamin hesitated. "Master, there are things—"

"Enough." Adrian cut him off. "What happened six months ago proved everything. She chose to lie for someone else. That ended us."

Benjamin's eyes grew moist. "The late master worried most about you."

Adrian's hands clenched the wheelchair arms, knuckles whitening.

"I'll recover." His voice was rough. "The company. The children. These legs... I'll make it all right again."

Outside, dusk deepened.
###Chapter 407: Because His Legs Are Short!

Benjamin stood at the study door, holding a freshly brewed cup of Longjing tea. The steam curled in the air as he hesitated, watching Adrian's silhouette.

"Young Master, Stella has changed quite a bit lately," Benjamin ventured carefully. "She seems more like her old cheerful self again."

Adrian's pen stilled on the document. The sunset through the floor-to-ceiling windows gilded his profile in gold.

He remembered sixteen-year-old Stella—her pale blue school dress, standing on tiptoe to pop a strawberry into his mouth. Sunlight had filtered through her hair, scattering flecks of light between them.

"Benjamin," Adrian set down the fountain pen. "There's still the merger case to handle."

The old butler sighed softly and closed the door. The mahogany hinges creaked faintly, like an unfinished sigh.

As night deepened, children's laughter spilled from the next room. Adrian wheeled himself onto the balcony, where the evening breeze carried the scent of magnolias past his brow.

"Mommy!" Luna's voice rang clear. "After the Little Mermaid turns to foam, will the prince miss her?"

Stella's reply was gentle as moonlight: "The prince will live happily ever after with the princess."

"That's so unfair for the mermaid!" Ethan protested. "If it were me, I'd steal the sea witch's potion!"

Celeste suddenly giggled. "We could get the mermaid a wheelchair! Like Daddy—"

Adrian's fingers tightened on the armrests. He heard Stella's sharp intake of breath.

"Because..." Her voice trembled slightly. "A mermaid's tail is too long for a wheelchair."

"I know!" Ethan shouted triumphantly. "Daddy uses a wheelchair because his legs are short!"

A fountain pen clattered to the floor.

Celeste bounced excitedly on the bed. "Then if my legs are short now, will I grow taller than Daddy?"

"Don't be silly," Stella's voice held amused exasperation. "Your father was on the varsity basketball team..."

She broke off abruptly. Adrian could almost see her biting her lip—that little habit when she was flustered.

"Mommy's blushing!" Luna announced. "Mommy, are you thinking about Daddy?"

The night breeze turned stifling. Adrian loosened his tie as pillow fight noises erupted next door. Amid Stella's flustered scolding, the children's laughter chimed like silver bells.

He bent to retrieve the pen, thumb brushing its cool metal clip. At sixteen, Stella had fumbled just as clumsily pinning his track meet number to his waist. Her fingers had grazed his side, and both their ears had burned red.

The merger documents still lay open on the desk, but suddenly all the dense figures transformed into the shape of her smiling eyes.
###Chapter 408: Daddy, Is It Because You Have Short Legs That You Use a Wheelchair?

Adrian Roland sat in his wheelchair, fingers absently tapping the armrest.

The playful noises from the next room gradually faded, allowing his tense nerves to finally relax. Only the rustling of turning pages and the soft ticking of the clock remained in the study.

He reached for the bone china cup on the desk, only to find it empty.

"Tsk." His brow furrowed.

Caffeine was his only lifeline now. Yet the wheelchair confined his movements, making even refilling a cup an impossible task.

Just as he was about to call for Benjamin Langley, a soft knock sounded at the door.

"Come in," he said without looking up. "Benjamin, could you please—"

His words cut off abruptly.

It wasn't Benjamin standing at the door, but little Luna Roland clutching a cartoon-patterned coaster. Steam rose from the freshly brewed coffee resting on it. The girl looked up at him with sparkling eyes.

"Daddy, Mommy said you need this."

Adrian's fingers trembled slightly as he accepted the cup. The familiar aroma instantly told him this was Stella Valentine's handiwork.

"Mommy worked hard in the kitchen," Luna blinked. "She said Blue Mountain Coffee is your favorite."

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"And she said you forget to drink water when you're working," Luna counted on her fingers. "Even worse than us kids."

A chuckle escaped him despite himself.

"Daddy should thank Mommy," Luna suddenly whispered conspiratorially, leaning closer.

Adrian ruffled his daughter's hair without responding.

"Daddy," Luna climbed onto his lap without warning, "when will you and Mommy make up?"

The question pierced his heart like a needle. He took a sip of coffee, letting the bitterness spread across his tongue.

"Want to go out this weekend?" He deflected. "We could fly kites."

"I want both Mommy and Daddy!" Luna pouted, her eyes growing moist. "Mommy clearly cares about you..."

Flustered, Adrian wiped the tears from his daughter's eyes. "Daddy will think about it, okay?"

Luna sniffled but quickly regained her cheer. She launched into an animated retelling of a fairy tale before suddenly dropping her voice:

"Daddy, is it because you have short legs that you use a wheelchair?"

Adrian nearly choked on his coffee.

"I promise not to tell Ethan and Celeste!" Luna raised a tiny finger solemnly.

"Little glutton," he pinched her nose playfully, "trying to scam chocolate again?"

Luna stuck out her tongue, but her gaze remained fixed on the coffee cup. "Daddy's coffee smells so good! I want some!"

"It's very bitter," he warned.

"I'm not scared!" She puffed out her chest like a brave little soldier.

Adrian shook his head in resignation but handed her the cup nonetheless.
###Chapter 409 The Moment of Falling in Love

"Daddy always keeps his promises!" Luna's eyes curved into crescents as she giggled, only for her whole face to scrunch up after tasting the coffee in Adrian's hand. "So bitter! Didn't Mommy add sugar for you?"

Adrian gazed at his daughter's eyes—so strikingly similar to Stella's—and for a moment, it felt like traveling through time. "Because Daddy's all grown up now."

He hadn't always been this composed and steady. In those youthful, carefree days, traces of Stella were everywhere. The memories were so beautiful they almost hurt to revisit.

Exhausted from playing, Luna curled up in his arms and drifted into a deep sleep. Mimicking how Stella used to soothe their children, Adrian gently patted her back. Only when he was certain she was sound asleep did he carefully cradle her closer.

Of their three children, Luna resembled Stella the most—her bright eyes, long lashes, even the slight upward curve of her lips as she slept, all mirroring the Stella he remembered.

Adrian set aside his work completely. Memories surged like a tide—riding through campus with Stella, counting stars under the willow trees by the moat. She loved resting her head on his lap, pointing at the night sky and claiming a star bore her name.

Almost unconsciously, he pulled open the drawer to his right and retrieved an old leather-bound journal. The moment the clasp snapped open, Stella's delicate handwriting greeted him.

This was her diary from her teenage years. He'd only skimmed it before, vaguely recalling a bucket list inside. Tonight, though, he felt an inexplicable urge to read it properly.

January 29, 2016 - Sunny

New diary debut! Ran into Adrian at the stationery store—he was actually watching me pick out notebooks! Ugh, I hadn’t even washed my hair after gym class. What was there to look at? Those popular guys are the worst, especially with their fan clubs nearly shoving me out the door!

The words brimmed with a teenage girl's frustration. Back then, Stella hadn’t realized her own feelings but was already jealous of the attention Adrian received. It reminded him of that afternoon.

After P.E., he hadn’t planned to stop by the snack bar. But when he saw Stella walk in, his feet moved on their own. Too bad she never turned around, missing his chance to strike up a conversation.

His lips curved unconsciously as he flipped further. Teenage Stella was lively and whimsical, her diary filled with wild imaginings.

February 3, 2016 - Rainy

Got caught in the rain without an umbrella. Just as I was about to use my backpack as cover, Adrian showed up. That umbrella had to be a gift from some girl—it had cartoon prints! Okay, fine, he’s good-looking, gets straight A’s, and plays soccer well, but the way girls fawn over him is ridiculous!

This passage had been lightly crossed out but remained legible. That umbrella had actually been a deliberate purchase—he thought she’d like the cartoon design, only to realize it backfired.

Fate had a funny way of twisting things. With a wry smile, he kept reading until, dozens of pages later, he found the turning point.

May 5, 2016 - Sunny

Shocking! Adrian actually confessed to me! If the sun weren’t still up, I’d think he’d been struck by lightning. But... my heart’s racing so fast. If there really were a deer in my chest, it’d be dead from crashing around by now.

He remembered that day clearly. After countless failed attempts to win her over, he’d resorted to a direct confession. Stella’s face had turned tomato-red. Though she hadn’t agreed immediately, her diary betrayed her flustered heart.

From then on, his presence filled her entries. She didn’t just write about him—she sketched his profile, simple yet uncannily lifelike.

To let Luna sleep more soundly, he turned off the main light, leaving only the soft glow of a desk lamp. Reading these words in the dim light felt like stepping back into his youth.

A third of the way in, he finally found the pivotal date.

May 13, 2016 - Rainy

Rain again, no umbrella again, Adrian again. This time, he didn’t have one either. Said he’d walk with me in the rain, then took off his jacket to shield me. Ended up drenched himself. Suddenly, having a boyfriend like him doesn’t seem so bad.

May 17, 2016 - Sunny

First date today. Wearing that floral sundress he likes. Hope he says I look pretty.

May 20, 2016 - Cloudy

Riding on the back of Adrian’s bike is amazing. Worked up the courage to hold his waist. Next time, I’ll hold tighter... and maybe measure his waistline while I’m at it.
###Chapter 410 I'm a Little Worried

The diary entries grew shorter toward the end. Some pages contained only simple heart and smiley face doodles, yet they conveyed Stella Valentine's joy more vividly than any words. Adrian Roland's fingertips lightly traced the yellowed pages, as if he could still feel the warmth of those long-ago moments.

The final page held just one line: Adrian gave me a new diary. How wonderful.

He stared at those words for a long time. So she had truly loved him once.

Since that day, though they lived under the same roof, they moved like parallel lines—never intersecting. Meal times were deliberately staggered, and even the children's carefully orchestrated attempts to leave them alone together only resulted in polite, empty exchanges.

"Mommy, it's your turn to tell Daddy to go to bed," Luna said, counting on her chubby fingers. "Ethan went the day before yesterday, I went yesterday, and Celeste went today."

All three children gazed at her with hopeful eyes.

Stella stroked her daughter's hair. "Mommy can't right now—"

"You're lying!" Luna's eyes suddenly welled up. "You stand outside Daddy's door every night!"

Stella's heart clenched.

She was still hesitating, hand raised mid-knock, when the study door swung open. Adrian's wheelchair stopped at the threshold, the light casting shadows across his sharply defined features.

"Did you need something?" His voice was flat.

"The children said you weren't asleep yet..." Stella twisted the hem of her shirt. "I was a little worried."

Adrian's gaze dropped to her whitened knuckles. "I was making arrangements for Grandfather's funeral."

The words landed like a stone in water. Stella's throat tightened. "I'm sorry."

"Go get some rest." He turned his wheelchair. "The days ahead will be busy."

The door closed softly, but the sound cut like a knife.

The funeral was scheduled for the weekend. The memorial was set up in the old estate's garden, white drapes fluttering in the breeze. Ethan ran off to help Benjamin Langley arrange flowers, while Luna and Celeste stayed with their mother to review the guest list.

"The master loved hearing the young misses recite poetry," Benjamin murmured, wiping his eyes.

Stella's pen stilled, leaving a small ink blot on the paper. She remembered Edward Roland's trembling grip as he lay dying, his whispered plea: "Take care of Adrian for me."

She had nodded through tears that day—and failed to keep her promise.

"Mommy?" Celeste tugged her sleeve. "How do you pronounce this character?"

Stella blinked, realizing her daughter was pointing at the name of Edward's dearest friend. It struck her then—this funeral wasn't just a farewell. It was a witness to the chasm between her and Adrian.
###Chapter 411: Becoming Stars

Luna tiptoed to help Stella Valentine organize items, then tilted her head. "Mommy, why does everyone talk about Great-Grandpa, but he never visits us? Why are all these papers black and white?"

Her tiny finger pointed at the portrait of Mr. Edward Roland at the center of the memorial hall. The elderly man in the photo looked spirited, his dignified brows hinting at his youthful vigor.

Stella's fingers trembled slightly. "Tomorrow is Great-Grandpa's farewell ceremony. Everyone is coming to say goodbye."

"What does 'goodbye' mean?" Luna blinked. "Is Great-Grandpa going somewhere far away?"

Celeste immediately tugged Stella's sleeve. "Mommy, can we go find Great-Grandpa?"

Stella knelt and pulled both girls into her arms. "Great-Grandpa went to a beautiful place. We can't see him anymore, but we'll always remember him."

Luna's lips quivered, tears welling in her eyes. Just then, Ethan approached and gently touched his sisters' hair. "Great-Grandpa became a star. We can see him every night now."

Stella noticed the redness in her son's eyes, reminding her of Adrian Roland in his younger days. She softly added, "Yes, he'll be the brightest star watching over you."

"Can we go see the stars now?" Luna pleaded, looking up.

Celeste tugged Stella's sleeve again. "Mommy, I miss Great-Grandpa."

"After tomorrow's ceremony, I'll take you to the rooftop to see the stars," Stella promised quietly. "Great-Grandpa will be looking down, so be good tomorrow, okay?"

The next morning, the funeral proceeded as planned. The memorial hall was arranged simply yet solemnly, with a steady stream of mourners arriving.

Ethan handed out white boutonnieres, while Luna and Celeste stayed close to Stella, offering each guest a pot of vibrant green plants.

"What's this?" A guest hesitated upon receiving the plant.

Stella lightly brushed a leaf. "This was his favorite. Mr. Roland wanted everyone to remember him full of life."

Following her gaze, the guest saw Adrian in his wheelchair, solemnly lighting incense at the altar. The ceremony was understated, filled only with Mr. Roland's favorite melody drifting through the hall.

During the tribute, Stella bowed deeply before the portrait of the kind-faced old man, her eyes stinging with memories of his warmth.

After the funeral, Adrian retreated to his study alone. Respecting his space, Stella kept her promise and took the children to the rooftop.

"Wow!" All three gasped in unison, never having noticed this stargazing spot at home before.

Stella lifted Celeste, pointing skyward. "Look, so many stars."

Luna suddenly pulled chocolates from her pocket, raising them high. Ethan steadied her. "Careful."

"I want to give Great-Grandpa chocolate," Luna said, voice trembling. "Stars must be cold. He'd want something sweet."

Stella hugged her with one arm. "He'd be so happy knowing you thought of him."

Luna's tears finally spilled as she buried her face in Ethan's chest. "I won't eat chocolate ever again if Great-Grandpa comes back!"

The night breeze whispered, and the stars twinkled tenderly above them.
###Chapter 412: I Am Their Biological Father

Celeste curled up in Stella's arms, her tiny fingers clutching the hem of Stella's shirt. Too young to understand the concept of farewell, she only sensed the sorrow hanging in the air.

"Mommy, where did Grandpa go?" Luna looked up with confusion swimming in her eyes.

Stella's throat tightened. She didn’t know how to explain death. Instead, she pulled all three children closer, offering silent comfort through her warmth.

Night deepened, and a cold draft seeped through the terrace cracks. Stella removed her coat to wrap around Ethan, then cradled her daughters in her arms. Exhausted from crying, they drifted off one by one.

She hesitated, debating whether to wake them and return to their rooms, when the sound of wheels rolling across the floor startled her.

"Let me take them."

That familiar voice sent a jolt through her. She turned to see Adrian appearing behind her, his pale features silvered by moonlight.

"How did you get up here?" Her voice trembled as her gaze dropped to his cast-bound legs. The villa had no elevator, and the steep stairs must have been torture for him.

Adrian didn’t answer. He simply reached out and gathered Luna and Celeste into his arms. The children nuzzled against him, settling back into sleep almost instantly.

Stella noticed the fine beads of sweat on his forehead, the subtle tremble in his grip on the wheelchair handles. Instinctively, she moved to steady him—but withdrew her hand at the last second.

"Where's Benjamin?" she whispered.

"Asleep." Adrian adjusted the children with surprising gentleness. "You should rest."

She shook her head. "You can't handle all three alone. I—"

"I'm their father." His voice was low but firm. "This much is nothing."

Moonlight carved sharp shadows along his jawline. Stella realized how much weight he’d lost—his hospital gown hung loosely over his shoulders, the confident aura he once carried now vanished.

Her heart clenched. She opened her mouth, but all that came out was, "Call me if you need anything."

As she turned to leave, Celeste murmured in her sleep: "Daddy..."

Adrian froze. He stared down at his daughter’s face, emotions churning in his eyes. Stella quickened her steps, unable to bear the sight.

At the end of the hallway, she stopped a passing maid. "When did Benjamin return?"

"He retired right after dinner," the maid replied, puzzled. "Said his back was hurting badly."

Stella’s breath caught. So Adrian had dragged himself up those stairs alone? She spun around toward the terrace—but only darkness stared back.

Back in her room, sleep eluded her. Tree shadows danced mockingly outside her window, taunting her cowardice. Finally, she slipped out of bed, heated a glass of milk, and headed for Adrian’s room.

A sliver of light bled from beneath his door. She raised her hand to knock—then heard muffled coughing from inside.

Her fingers hovered midair, never quite touching the wood.
###Chapter 413: Starlight Hidden in the Heart

She hesitated for a moment before tiptoeing toward the bedroom. The habit was ingrained in her bones, unshaken even after all this time apart.

The door opened without a sound. Though she knew the room was empty, Stella instinctively moved with quiet care, as if afraid to disturb something.

The bedside lamp cast a soft glow. She reached to turn it off but accidentally knocked over a photograph on the nightstand.

The unframed picture fluttered downward. Stella caught it just in time, her fingers brushing the surface—her heart skipped a beat.

"Close call..." she murmured, but her gaze lingered on the image.

It was a Polaroid. Against the backdrop of an amusement park, three children grinned with crescent-moon eyes. She and Adrian stood hand in hand in the center, their smiles brighter than sunlight.

Their happiest days.

Her fingertips traced the photo as if she could touch those irretrievable moments. If she could turn back time, she'd tell her younger self how deeply this man had loved her.

She studied the picture for a long while before reluctantly preparing to return it. As she flipped it over, an elegant cursive inscription caught her eye.

"My stars..."

Her voice trembled slightly.

So he'd never forgotten.

Stella slipped the photo into her pocket. That night, she slept soundly, dreaming of Adrian as a teenager promising to show her the stars.

Even without a future, she still had these memories to cherish.

Morning commotion startled her awake. Benjamin's frantic voice came through the door: "Mrs. Roland! The children and Mr. Roland are missing!"

She bolted upright, then threw on a coat and rushed out. "Follow me!"

On the rooftop terrace, dawn light bathed the slumbering family of five. Adrian sat in his wheelchair, their daughters nestled in his arms. Ethan, wrapped in Adrian's jacket, slept soundly on the bench.

Benjamin exhaled in relief. "You scared me half to death..."

Stella gently touched Ethan's shoulder and noticed the jacket's collar had been knotted. The small detail warmed her heart.

"Let's get the children back inside first," she said, reaching for the girls.

Just then, Adrian opened his eyes. In the morning light, he gazed at Stella with a dazed smile. "Little star..."

His voice was as tender as it had been ten years ago.

Stella froze.

"Don't wear such thin clothes," he murmured sleepily. "You'll catch cold on the bike."

The words unlocked a flood of memories—teenage Adrian waiting for her every morning on his bicycle, rain or shine.

Her eyes burned. Softly, she replied, "I know."

Adrian's expression cleared. Realizing what he'd said, his face tightened. "You heard nothing."

The morning breeze carried away his dreamlike whisper. But Stella knew some things remained etched in the heart—like the handwriting on the back of that photograph.
###Chapter 414: None of Your Concern

Benjamin stood to the side, his gaze shifting between Adrian and Stella with a knowing smile playing on his lips.

Luna and Celeste stretched in Adrian's arms, rubbing their sleepy eyes.

Stella took Celeste from him, gently holding her small hand. "Don't rub your eyes." She looked directly at Adrian. "How did you get up here last night?"

"What?" Benjamin's eyes widened in shock. "Didn't you come up together, Master Adrian?"

Stella shook her head. "I thought you helped him."

Adrian remained silent, his focus solely on protecting Luna in his arms.

"Mom! Dad!" Ethan sat up, rubbing his eyes before brightening at the sight before him. "Are you back together?"

They both turned away simultaneously. "Breakfast first."

The moment the words left their mouths, they froze.

Stella took a deep breath, her eyes glistening. "Last night, you wouldn't let me ask... Was it because... you walked up here yourself? With the wheelchair?"

She could almost picture him dragging his injured leg, struggling to carry the heavy wheelchair.

"No." Adrian denied firmly. "This has nothing to do with you."

The sight of her reddened eyes softened his heart, and his tone unconsciously gentled. "Take the kids down for breakfast."

In the morning light, he stared into the distance, lost in thought.

Benjamin finally snapped out of his daze, stomping his foot in frustration. "Master Adrian! The doctor said you mustn’t put weight on your leg!"

"I'm fine." Adrian replied calmly. "Tell everyone to stop searching."

Benjamin hesitated, then sighed and headed downstairs.

Only the family of five remained on the rooftop.

"I won’t leave until you explain." Stella stood her ground stubbornly.

"Suit yourself." Adrian turned away, though the tips of his ears reddened slightly.

"Dad can fly!" Ethan suddenly jumped up, waving his arms excitedly. "Mom said Dad is a superhero!"

Luna and Celeste immediately believed him, gazing at Adrian with admiration.

"Is Daddy’s wheelchair a flying machine?" Celeste blinked her big eyes.

Adrian sighed and ruffled her hair. "...Yes."

Stella smiled wryly as she carried Celeste closer, letting the children see the heavy wheelchair for themselves.

Downstairs, Benjamin hurriedly instructed the staff before rushing back up. At the stairwell, he nearly tripped.

"What's this..." He steadied himself against the wall, noticing a trace of ash in the corner.

Following the mark, he spotted a cigarette butt lying on the steps below.

Benjamin looked up toward the rooftop, as if seeing Adrian standing there alone the night before. He had known Stella would bring the children to see the stars—so he had waited there in advance.
###Chapter 415 I Have a Way

Adrian Roland gazed at the starry sky, lost in thought.

The innocent chatter of his three children echoed in his ears. He couldn't help but wonder—how wonderful it would be if one of those stars really was Grandpa watching over them. The cigarette between his fingers had burned down to the filter, the sudden sting snapping him back to reality.

"Daddy's smoking again!" Ethan's voice rang out.

Adrian hastily crushed the cigarette and turned to see Stella holding their three children. Luna and Celeste were already asleep, but Ethan stared at him with wide, alert eyes.

"Sorry," he murmured, wheeling himself backward to leave.

Stella stopped him. "Benjamin told me everything."

Adrian froze. That old butler could never keep his mouth shut.

"Go to the hospital for a checkup," Stella said softly, yet firmly. "Do it for the kids."

He instinctively wanted to refuse, but the hopeful looks on their faces choked his words.

"Master Adrian, the car is ready," Benjamin appeared at the staircase, his face lined with concern.

Adrian rubbed his aching knee. The old injury from last night's rain had flared up worse than usual, but he had more pressing matters to attend to.

"Another time," he said flatly.

Stella suddenly knelt to meet his eye level. "Do you know what the kids look forward to most?"

Without waiting for an answer, she continued, "They're waiting to see their dad become a superhero."

Ethan piped up, "Superheroes always check their gear regularly!"

Luna stirred awake, rubbing her eyes before clinging to his leg. "If Daddy doesn't go to the hospital, I'll cry."

Adrian was torn between laughter and exasperation. These three little troublemakers were impossible to resist.

"Fine," he finally relented. "But just a basic checkup."

A victorious smile curved Stella's lips as she helped him up. Her warm, steady grip reminded him of their mountain-climbing days years ago.

"Slowly," she whispered.

As he rose, a sharp pain shot through his knee. He gritted his teeth, but beads of sweat still formed at his temples.

"Daddy, does it hurt?" Celeste stretched on tiptoes to wipe his forehead.

He forced a smile. "No pain. Daddy's Iron Man."

The children cheered, clamoring to help him downstairs. Stella lingered behind, watching the scene with unreadable emotions.

Benjamin sidled up to her. "Madam Stella always knows how to handle him."

She gazed at Adrian's stubbornly straight back and murmured, "Because he never says no to the kids."

The engine roared to life below. Stella took a deep breath and hurried after them.

This battle of wills with the most stubborn man was only just beginning.
###Chapter 416: Taking the Initiative Isn't So Bad

Stella Valentine helped Adrian Roland descend from the rooftop. They walked in silence, yet their years of relationship allowed their steps to fall into perfect synchrony, as if connected by an unspoken understanding.

Only when Adrian was safely seated did Stella's worry ease. She instructed their three children to look after their father before turning to fetch his wheelchair from the maid. Though exhausted, a quiet warmth bloomed in her chest at being able to care for him.

"Miss Valentine." Adrian's voice stopped her, his gaze fixed on the table. "Rest first. We'll leave after breakfast."

The children immediately perked up at the shift in their parents' dynamic, but Stella swiftly hushed their excitement. She guided each to wash up, pausing to cast one last lingering glance at Adrian—words trembling on her tongue yet left unspoken.

Their history was too complicated. The past stood between them like an invisible wall, making it impossible to return to being strangers yet equally difficult to pretend nothing had happened.

After breakfast, the car arranged by Benjamin Langley waited at the entrance. The elderly steward secured the wheelchair with a relieved smile. "Little Star, I'll entrust the young master to you. Someone needs to mind the house, so I won't accompany you."

Stella settled Ethan beside her, double-checking the girls' safety seats before responding, "Don't worry."

She hadn't planned to bring the children, but their insistence forced additional preparations. Pressed against the car windows, they chorused, "Goodbye, Grandpa Benjamin!"

Their innocent voices drew laughter from the steward and softened even Adrian's stern features.

Navigating the hospital proved challenging. Pushing the wheelchair, Stella reminded Ethan to watch his sisters. Following Benjamin's medical records, they located the orthopedic department.

The attending physician was a seasoned specialist who frowned upon examining Adrian's leg. "Didn't we advise against weight-bearing? The bones have shifted again."

Stella paled. "Is it serious?"

"Requires realignment. Strange—this level of pain usually can't be ignored." The doctor's eyes darted between them before lighting with realization.

He cleared his throat. "Young people, I understand. But moderation is key—you already have three children."

Adrian massaged his temples, unprepared for the respected specialist's sudden八卦.

Stella's ears burned crimson. "You've misunderstood—"

"I'm no prude." The doctor winked. "Wait until the leg heals. If you really can't resist—"

"Doctor!" Adrian cut in. "It was my own carelessness."

This only cemented the physician's assumptions. While the children looked on curiously—Ethan nodding sagely, the girls bewildered—Celeste tugged Stella's hand. "Mommy, why can't you hug Daddy?"

"Adult matters," the doctor chuckled, offering candy before turning to Stella. "My granddaughter idolizes you two—calls it 'celestial romance' or such."

He referenced the viral photo from old Mr. Roland's birthday banquet years prior, where Adrian had carried Stella in his arms—an image that once dominated headlines.

Stella hadn't expected the memory to resurface here. A smile tugged her lips unbidden. "That was us."

Adrian remained silent, but his gaze gentled.

The doctor continued唠叨, "Couples like you often push limits. Last week, a lad reinjured himself because his girlfriend got overeager—"

Flushing, Stella nodded hastily, desperate to avoid further inappropriate commentary.

Predictably, the man lowered his voice. "Honestly, you could take the initiative—"

The room plunged into silence. Adrian's expression cycled through shock, embarrassment, and disbelief while Stella turned scarlet.

Luna blinked up innocently. "Mommy, what do you and Daddy need that's so troubling?"
###Chapter 417: Tricking the Kids!

The examination room smelled strongly of antiseptic.

Stella Valentine sat on a bench in the corner, her fingers tightly gripping the strap of her purse. Ethan and Celeste leaned against her on either side while Luna perched on her lap.

"Mommy, what did the doctor say about Daddy?" Luna tilted her little face upward, blinking her large eyes.

Stella's hands trembled slightly. She forced a smile. "The doctor said... Daddy's leg needs lots of rest."

"Then why were you whispering?" Ethan's sharp ears caught the lie. "I heard the doctor say Daddy's leg needs to be reset."

Celeste immediately jumped up from the bench. "What? Daddy's leg is broken?"

Stella quickly covered her youngest daughter's mouth. "Shh—"

Adrian Roland sat pale as paper in his wheelchair. He gave the children a weak smile. "It's nothing serious. Just like when Lego pieces don't fit right—you take them apart and rebuild."

"That's a lie!" Ethan's eyes reddened suddenly. "Legos don't hurt!"

Silence fell over the examination room.

Stella felt her throat tighten. She knelt to meet the children's eyes. "Daddy got hurt protecting us. Now the doctor needs to help him. Can you all be good?"

Luna burst into tears. "I don't want Daddy to hurt!"

Adrian wheeled himself closer. He wiped Luna's tears away. "Daddy promises to take you all to Disneyland when my leg gets better, okay?"

"Really?" Celeste sniffled.

"Of course." Adrian ruffled her hair. "When has Daddy ever lied to you?"

Stella turned her face away, afraid the children would see her reddening eyes.

The doctor entered with a clipboard. "Family member needs to sign some forms."

Stella stood up gratefully. "I'll be right back."

She practically fled the room.

The cool hallway air helped calm her. Her hands still shook as she signed the forms.

"The reduction will be painful." The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Your husband insists on no anesthesia."

Stella looked up sharply. "Why?"

"Says he doesn't want the children to see him weak." The doctor sighed. "Stubborn man."

Stella's heart clenched. She took a deep breath. "What can I do?"

"Just wait outside." The doctor turned to leave. "Oh, and the children shouldn't be present."

Back at the examination room door, Stella heard Adrian's voice inside. "Ethan, take your sisters to wait for Mommy outside."

"Daddy..."

"Be good."

The door opened. Three red-eyed children emerged. Stella knelt down. "How about the nurse takes you for ice cream?"

Once they were gone, she reentered.

Adrian now lay on the treatment table, his shirt soaked through with sweat.

"Begin," he told the doctor.

Stella stood in the corner, nails digging into her palms.

The first crack of bone realignment made Adrian's back arch violently. His fingers turned white as they gripped the sheets.

Stella covered her mouth.

"Bear with it." The doctor's forehead beaded with sweat. "Almost done."

A strangled groan escaped Adrian's throat. Veins stood out on his temples, his entire body drenched as if pulled from water.

When Stella saw the doctor push the displaced bone back into place, her tears finally overflowed.

"Done." The doctor exhaled in relief. "Now for the cast."

Adrian managed a weak smile. "Thank you."

Only then did Stella realize her cheeks were wet. She hastily wiped her face, but heard Adrian say, "Don't cry... It didn't hurt."

That shattered her completely.

She remembered the boy who'd once shielded her from everything, now this man who'd rather bite through his teeth than show weakness before his children.

After the doctor left, only the two of them remained.

Stella approached the bed and gently took Adrian's hand. His palm was clammy.

"Was it worth it?" she whispered.

Adrian looked at her, his gaze tender yet resolute. "For you all, anything is worth it."
###Chapter 418: A Dignity More Painful Than Death

Stella Valentine stood outside the examination room, her fingernails unconsciously digging into her palms. Only when the nurse's voice reached her ears did she snap back to reality.

"Mrs. Roland?" The nurse looked at her with concern.

Stella took two hurried steps back, afraid of disturbing the person inside. She forced a smile. "Sorry, I was lost in thought."

The nurse lowered her voice sympathetically. "The reduction process is painful. Family members can accompany the patient."

The word "family" froze Stella's smile.

Noticing her reaction, the nurse said gently, "I can see how worried you are about Mr. Roland."

Stella lowered her lashes. Of course she wanted to go in, but she knew Adrian Roland too well.

That man, proud to his core, would rather die than let her see him in such a vulnerable state.

People moved through the corridor, each patient accompanied by someone. Stella suddenly remembered a post she'd read in college—the highest level of loneliness was undergoing surgery alone.

Back then, she'd lain on the campus lawn, her head resting on Adrian's lap, and asked, "If I ever skip class to drag you to a concert, would you come?"

The boy had looked down at her, sunlight dancing on his eyelashes. "I'd follow you to the ends of the earth."

Who could have guessed that casual joke would now feel like cruel irony?

"He has strong pride," Stella explained to the nurse. "Please don’t tell him I’m here."

The nurse nodded in understanding. "Don’t worry."

"By the way, have you seen the children?"

"They're at the nurses' station," the nurse said with a smile. "Your eldest is so responsible—he’s taking great care of his sisters."

Stella managed another faint smile. Happiness? This family had already shattered long ago.

Once the nurse left, Stella returned to her spot by the door. She heard the doctor’s deliberately light chatter, the rustle of bandages being wrapped, until finally, the doctor exhaled in relief. "Done."

She didn’t enter immediately.

Only when she estimated Adrian had composed himself did she deliberately step heavily and knock.

"Come in."

Pushing the door open, Stella waved the medicine bag in her hand. "The line was so long."

The doctor gave her a knowing look but didn’t expose her.

Adrian’s face was pale, his forehead damp with sweat, yet his expression remained detached. "The kids are at the nurses' station."

"I know." Stella pretended this was news to her, her gaze flickering over his white-knuckled grip on the sheets.

The doctor warned, "One more dislocation, and this leg will be beyond repair."

Stella’s chest tightened. "I’ll make sure he’s careful."

"And the wound must stay dry..."

She noted each instruction carefully, unaware of the man on the bed watching her with eyes as turbulent as a stormy sea.
###Chapter 419: Cowards All Around

The doctor rambled on with numerous instructions. Stella Valentine listened attentively, while Adrian Roland's expression grew increasingly tense.

"I'll handle these matters. We have staff at home," he suddenly interjected.

He avoided Stella's gaze instinctively. Letting her help him bathe? Absolutely not. That secret—he'd rather die than let her discover it.

The examination room was eerily silent, the rustling of the assistant gathering bandages unnervingly clear. The doctor glanced between the young couple, baffled by how the atmosphere had turned so awkward in the brief time it took to retrieve medication.

"Did you two argue on the way here?" the doctor ventured.

"No," they answered in unison.

The doctor chuckled. "That level of coordination and you claim there was no argument? I get it—married couples bicker. What's fought at the head of the bed is made up at the foot."

Stella smiled bitterly. If only it were just a simple quarrel. She stole a glance at Adrian and found his brow deeply furrowed.

Unaware, the doctor continued, "Men should be more magnanimous. What's wrong with indulging your wife? You didn't even flinch during bone realignment, yet you're picking fights with her?"

Adrian lowered his eyes without responding.

Those dark days were memories he refused to revisit. Stella, misunderstanding his silence as lingering resentment, pretended not to hear and focused on asking the doctor for detailed care instructions.

Whether he forgave her or not was his choice. Her only concern was fulfilling her duty to ensure he suffered no unnecessary pain.

"Just explain everything to me," Stella said decisively. "He can't move right now anyway, so bathing arrangements are my call."

"What kind of logic is that?" Adrian blurted out, momentarily transported back to their old bantering dynamic.

They both froze.

The doctor mediated with a laugh, "Listen to me—family assistance is mandatory for bathing. Even the most familiar male attendant is still an outsider. Two grown men bathing naked together? That's hardly proper."

Adrian opened his mouth to retort when sudden giggles erupted from the nurses. They stole glances at the strikingly handsome man, their imaginations running wild as they doubled over in laughter.

Stella suppressed her own amusement and earnestly consulted the doctor. As she bent to take notes, her serene profile radiated quiet focus—so reminiscent of the bright, quick-witted girl she'd been at twenty.

Adrian stared at her hungrily. What fault was there in her seeking revenge? Six months in prison paled in comparison to the suffering she'd endured. Vincent Atlante's crimes were insignificant next to her pain.

When Julian Valois had asked about his plans after release, what could he say? He couldn't let go, but her love for him had long since faded. Their current relationship—awkward and distant—was a tangled knot they both chose to avoid.

At least in this, they were perfectly synchronized.

Cowards all around.

"I've noted everything down," Stella said, tucking away her phone with a smile.

The doctor nodded approvingly. "With your care, your husband will recover splendidly. Last time, a patient secretly drank soy milk before his examination—drove me mad!"

Stella stifled a laugh. "I promise not to bathe him in soy milk."

"Once he's healed, you can bathe him however you like!" The doctor guffawed.

The door swung open abruptly. A nurse returned with three children, reluctant to part with them. "Your babies are absolutely adorable. I didn't want to give them back."

Ethan puffed out his chest. "Mom, I watched over the girls the whole time!"

Stella patted his shoulder. "Ethan, you're so dependable."

The nurse waved at the twins. "They've made me want daughters of my own—little angels!"

The doctor teased, "Should I transfer you to pediatrics? Plenty of children there." The nurse fled in mock terror.

The children clustered around the wheelchair. Luna produced her treasured chocolate. "Daddy, does it hurt?"

Adrian accepted it gently. "Not at all."

Celeste puffed her cheeks and blew on his injury. "Blow the pain away!"

Ethan declared proudly, "Daddy's a superhero! Teach me later!"

Adrian ruffled his hair. "Being yourself is heroic enough. But remember—" His voice dropped. "Never betray those who love you. No matter how shocking the truth seems, believe in them. Otherwise... you'll regret it forever."
###Chapter 420: The Debt Remains

Stella Valentine glanced at her wristwatch. The hour hand pointed to four in the afternoon. Not wanting to delay the doctor's work, she quickly gathered her three children and bid Adrian Roland farewell.

The driver had already been notified. A black sedan waited silently at the hospital entrance.

Without Benjamin Langley's assistance, the return trip felt chaotic. Fortunately, Ethan Valentine helped look after his younger sisters, and the driver worked efficiently to secure the little ones in their child safety seats. Stella wiped the sweat from her temple before turning to steady Adrian.

"No need." His voice was cold as he refused, his bangs damp with sweat, clinging to his pale skin.

Stella studied his tense jawline and sighed softly. "Then take it slow."

Adrian stumbled the moment he took a step, nearly falling backward. Stella caught him swiftly, her palm meeting the icy chill of his back.

"Sir!" The driver rushed over in alarm.

The three children pressed against the car window. Little Luna covered her eyes in fright.

"How's your leg?" Stella's voice trembled. "Should we go back for a check-up? The doctor said another dislocation would be serious—"

"I'm fine." He gritted his teeth, cutting her off, the tips of his ears flushing red.

Stella bit back a smile. Even after all these years, this man's pride hadn't changed.

Silently, she offered her arm. After a brief hesitation, Adrian finally rested his hand on her shoulder. His touch was scorching, yet carefully avoiding direct contact.

"Careful!"

The car jolted, and Stella instinctively reached to steady him, her fingers brushing over the back of his hand. Both froze. Adrian recoiled as if burned, nearly tumbling back into the car.

Without another thought, Stella pushed him into the seat with all her strength. She folded the wheelchair with practiced ease, leaving the driver wide-eyed.

Adrian watched her slender figure, his Adam's apple bobbing. The girl who once struggled with bottle caps could now lift a folding wheelchair single-handedly. The memory of her raising their children alone overseas for four years weighed on his chest like a stone.

In the end, he owed her.

"What are you looking at?" Stella turned, meeting his conflicted gaze.

Adrian jerked his face away, pressing himself against the opposite door, leaving only his rigid back facing her.

The car fell so silent that the sound of Luna playing with her fingers was audible. Only when they arrived home and saw Benjamin did the quiet finally break.

"The doctor said the recovery is going well," Adrian said dismissively.

Stella nodded in agreement. "Just needs proper rest."

Benjamin exhaled in relief, calling the housekeeper to take the children for their baths. The living room emptied in moments, leaving only the two of them. Stella noticed his dress shirt soaked through, clinging to his spine.

"You're sweating," she murmured.

"I'll shower." He braced against the armrests to stand.

"No!" Stella blocked his path. "The wound can't get wet."

Adrian lifted his gaze. "What's our relationship? Since when do you get to decide?"

The words stabbed through Stella's heart. She drew a slow breath. "Let's just say we're roommates. Okay?"

He scoffed and limped toward the bathroom without looking back, leaning on his cane. Stella chased after him—only to hear a heavy thud from inside.
###Chapter 421 Can't I Even Help?

Stella Valentine sighed. "I understand what you're saying, but—"

"No buts." Adrian Roland cut her off. "I was too stubborn before, insisting on keeping you by my side. Don't worry, that won't happen again. Whether you want to start a new life or find a new partner, I'll respect your choice. But as your ex-husband, I must warn you—Vincent Atlante isn't the right man for you. If you're serious about moving on, consider your options carefully."

"What about you?"

"Me?"

Stella pressed her lips together. "If I leave, what will you do? Find a stepmother for the children?"

"You don't need to worry about that." Adrian's voice remained calm. "I'll never remarry."

Stella ventured another question. "Can't I at least help you?"

"Fine." Surprisingly, Adrian relented, though he stubbornly turned his face away. "You can move a chair into the bathroom, under the shower. I'll handle the rest myself. Don't interfere. Let this be the last time."

He avoided meeting her eyes, afraid one look at those bright orbs would soften his resolve.

Stella nodded helplessly. "Alright, I won't interfere. Rest here while I prepare the bathroom."

Since Adrian's return, Benjamin Langley had been tirelessly accommodating his mobility limitations. He'd cleared obstacles from Adrian's room and specially arranged a first-floor bathroom. Though less luxurious than the ensuite, it was more spacious.

Stella brought a comfortable chair from the dining room, carefully positioning it to avoid water splashes. She tested the showerhead and laid out fresh clothes before returning to the living room.

"Everything's ready," she said softly. "Let me help you there. Tell me if anything's inconvenient."

Adrian nodded silently and wheeled himself into the bathroom. Without the children present, he finally stopped pretending, slowly transferring himself to the chair with difficulty, bracing against the sink and bathtub.

Stella clenched her fists to stop herself from reaching out.

Once he was settled, she couldn't resist asking, "Should I adjust the water temperature first? It'll be hard to change later."

The distance from the chair to the temperature controls was considerable.

"No need." Adrian refused coldly. "Just move the wheelchair to the doorway. Getting it wet would be worse." He began unbuttoning his jacket, clearly dismissing her.

His movements were slow. When he reached the first shirt button and saw Stella still hadn't left in the mirror, he asked sharply, "Something else?"

"Your leg needs waterproofing." Stella held up a roll of plastic wrap she'd grabbed from the kitchen on impulse.

Adrian paused, silently marveling at her quirky solution. Suppressing the urge to smile, he kept his expression stern. "I'll do it myself."

Probably his most repeated phrase today.

Stella didn't insist. After ensuring he was stable, she turned to leave—though her worries lingered. Adrian's leg injury remained a thorn in her heart, yet she'd never gotten a proper look at the wound.

She lingered outside the bathroom door, ready to assist. With his stubbornness, waiting for him to ask for help was hopeless.

Five minutes passed. Then ten. No sound of running water came from inside.

Frowning, Stella pressed her ear to the door. Fifteen minutes later, the silence felt ominous.

"Are you alright? Do you need help?" She finally knocked.

Adrian, struggling with the plastic wrap, startled at the sound. "I'm fine! No help needed!" Annoyed he hadn't locked the door, he raised his voice when he couldn't stand. "Leave me alone!"

His uncharacteristic tone worried Stella more. "Just one look, okay?"

"No!" The words hissed through clenched teeth. "I told you to stay out!"

His hoarse, urgent voice sounded like he was in pain.

"If you don't let me in, I'm calling Benjamin!" Stella's hand gripped the doorknob.

Adrian warned sharply, "Don't you dare come in! This has nothing to do with you!"

His obstinacy only confirmed her suspicions. She took a deep breath. "Last chance. If you don't tell me the truth, I'm coming in!"
###Chapter 422 My Stars

Stella Valentine took a deep breath and pushed open the bathroom door abruptly.

Adrian Roland was struggling to put on his shirt when the noise made him look up. Their eyes locked.

The ornate tattoo on his chest—"my stars"—glared under the light.

"Get out!" he snapped, yanking the shirt to cover the ink.

Stella didn't move. Her eyes reddened instantly. "When did you get that?"

"Can't remember." His fingers trembled as he fumbled with the buttons.

"You never had this tattoo before." Her voice shook.

Adrian stood abruptly, his shirt still untucked. "I said get out!"

His voice was loud but carried a hint of unease.

Instead of leaving, Stella stepped forward. "My English name. Our children. And you say it's none of my business?"

He turned his face away. "Star tattoos are common."

"Really?" She gave a hollow laugh. "Then why the plural?"

His Adam's apple bobbed before he muttered, "Just a reminder of past mistakes."

"Wearing wet clothes counts as 'fine' now?" Stella suddenly began tying up her hair.

Adrian frowned. "I need to shower."

"The doctor said your wound can't get wet." She rolled up her sleeves briskly. "Hand me the plastic wrap."

"I'll do it myself."

Stella reached for his buttons directly. The soaked shirt soon landed in the laundry basket.

"Seen enough?" His voice was hoarse.

"Not even close." Her fingertips traced the tattoo lightly. "I want a better look."

Adrian's breath hitched.

When her hand moved toward his belt, he grabbed her wrist roughly. "That's enough!"

She broke free and suddenly dashed out.

As Adrian moved to lock the door, she returned holding scissors.

"What are you doing?" His eyes widened.

"Cutting it off." She waved the scissors. "You have plenty of clothes anyway."

"Stella!" He gritted his teeth. "Since when did you become so—"

"So what?" She tilted her head. "Like Vincent?"

Adrian's face darkened instantly.
###Chapter 423: How Could I Not Love You!?

Stella knew him too well.

The pain hidden in those deep eyes was crystal clear to her.

"Vincent Atlante means nothing to me." She stepped forward, her voice soft yet firm. "About identifying you at the police station—I can explain—"

"Don't bother." He turned his head away, jaw clenched tight.

"You need to hear this." Stella crouched down to meet his gaze. "Adrian Roland, haven't we had enough misunderstandings between us? You taught Ethan to trust the ones he loves. Why can't you do the same?"

Her words struck like a knife, piercing his weakest spot.

"Not love you?" Adrian whipped his head back, dark fire burning in his eyes. "Stella Valentine, how dare you—"

The words died on his lips as they both froze.

Only their breathing echoed in the bathroom.

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed before he finally relented. "Talk."

Stella exhaled in relief, fingers unconsciously gripping her shirt hem. "Vincent lied about having a bomb. With so many people in the hospital, I had to play along—"

"Enough." He cut her off. "I apologize. Now can you leave?"

"You still don't believe me?"

"I do."

"Then why push me away?"

Adrian faltered, eyes fixed on the tiles behind her rather than meeting her gaze.

"Why?" she pressed.

"No reason." His voice turned hoarse. "I need to shower."

Without hesitation, Stella grabbed scissors and went straight for the hem of his shirt.

"You—!" Adrian braced against the armrests to rise, but she shoved him back down.

"Don't take your injuries lightly."

"I'm not." The reply came too quick.

Stella leaned against the wall. "Fine. I'll wait until you change your mind."

An eerie silence fell over the bathroom.

Five minutes later, beads of sweat formed at Adrian's temple. "Aren't you tired?"

"Not at all." She didn't budge.

He scoffed, yet his gaze kept drifting toward her. The simple white tee, jeans, and high ponytail made her look just like she did in their school days.

Another ten minutes passed before Adrian finally surrendered, sinking into the chair with resignation.

Stella exhaled quietly, carefully maneuvering the scissors around his leg cast. "Stay still."

Adrian closed his eyes, only for his other senses to heighten. The scent of jasmine filled his nose. Her warm breath ghosted over his skin.

"Tell me if it hurts." Her whisper was featherlight.

When the scissors snipped, his lashes fluttered.

As Stella knelt to tend to his pant leg, Adrian couldn't help but look. From this angle, he saw the tiny whirl at her crown and the slight press of her lips.

Her touch was as gentle as handling fragile glass.

"I'll do the front myself." His voice was ragged when the towel brushed his chest.

Stella ignored him, her fingers accidentally grazing the tattoo over his heart.

Bang—

They both froze.

Her palm now rested directly over his pounding heartbeat.
###Chapter 424: A Future as Fragile as Cicada Wings

Their proximity allowed them to hear each other's heartbeats.

The scent of jasmine enveloped Adrian Roland, effortlessly dismantling every defense he had built.

"Why?" His voice was hoarse.

Stella Valentine's hand stilled slightly.

She had waited too long for this question.

Since that day, she had wanted to explain countless times but never found the chance. Gradually, her urgency hardened into obsession—just seeing him one more time would be enough.

Adrian suddenly gripped her wrist.

"Why are you kind to me now?" Bloodshot veins threaded his eyes. "Have you forgotten how I hurt you?"

Her breath hitched.

"You should hate me." His voice was terrifyingly calm. "Why didn't you let me die there?"

Her fingers trembled.

"I—"

"Get out."

He released her. Six months in prison had extinguished every hope he once held. Those illusions had shattered over time, leaving only despair.

"I had no choice." Stella's eyes reddened. "I couldn't watch you die."

Vincent Atlante had already lost his mind by then. She would rather die herself than see him in danger.

"Too late." Adrian shook his head. "I can't trust anymore."

He had once believed so deeply in her promises of forever.

Now, that same belief terrified him.

"You're free." His voice was hollow. "As you wished—never see each other again."

Stella bit her lip.

Steam fogged the bathroom. She reached for the showerhead. "Let's finish washing up first."

"No." He snatched it away. "We settle this today."

He feared his own weakness.

Feared that fragile hope crumbling once more.

"You still don't trust me." Her whisper was barely audible.

"Please. Stop."

The words stabbed Stella's heart. She remembered the proud, radiant Adrian she had once known—now destroyed by her own hands.

"I'll leave once you recover." She surrendered.

Adrian closed his eyes in silence.

Stella reclaimed the showerhead. Under the rushing water, she murmured, "Close your eyes."

His hair tangled between her fingers. Soap bubbles slid away with the stream, carrying the last remnants of warmth.
###Chapter 425: Brother Adrian

Adrian Roland's spine stiffened instantly.

Stella Valentine sighed softly. "Let's do this. I'll return what you owe me, and we'll be even. A fresh start, okay?"

Memories from age twelve flooded back. In seventh grade, she'd worn a white blouse with a plaid skirt uniform, her hair in a high ponytail. Her amethyst eyes sparkled with mischief.

"Adrian, this is your sister," his mother had introduced.

He'd scoffed at the memory. From that very first glance, he'd never seen her as a sister.

Teenage Stella had been a radiant sunbeam, impossible to look away from.

"Brother Adrian." Her voice rang clear and bright, utterly unselfconscious.

Brother Adrian...

The term felt like it belonged to another lifetime.

Adrian squeezed his eyes shut, forcing down the surge of emotion. He had no response.

Stella seemed unfazed. She focused on wrapping a towel around his dripping hair, then carefully wiped his legs. Avoiding the wounds, she dabbed only the edges.

"Does it hurt?" she asked.

Adrian remained statue-still. Stella pressed her lips together and kept working. No reaction meant no pain, she reasoned.

"Master Adrian! Are you alright? The doctor said no water on the wounds!" Benjamin Langley's frantic knocking startled them.

Stella scrambled to wipe water splashes from her clothes. "Don't worry, Benjamin. I've got this."

The old man's relieved chuckle came through the door. "Good, good. With our little star here, I can rest easy. The children are asleep, so I'll turn in too."

He'd always known—if Stella returned, the young master could endure anything. Their biggest mistake these past six months was not bringing her back sooner.

As Benjamin's footsteps faded, Adrian opened his mouth to speak. Stella beat him to it. "This is my towel. Yours is hanging over there. And...you haven't finished washing."

The air froze.

Both adults, former lovers—the implication needed no explanation.

Yet strangely, after the initial awkwardness, the tension between them eased slightly.

"Like this towel? It's yours." Stella waved the pink star-patterned towel playfully.

Adrian's mouth twitched. "Pass."

He grabbed his own towel and briskly dried off. Certain areas required privacy.

"Done," he said curtly.

"Kicking me out again?" Stella understood perfectly. Steam had flushed her cheeks pink, her damp eyes making it impossible to stay harsh.

Adrian covered his eyes with one hand. "I'm tired."

These useless legs reminded him constantly—Stella's affection was fleeting. To her, he'd always been just a plaything.

She bit her lip until it paled. "I'll leave after getting you to bed. Doctor's orders—no unnecessary standing."

She removed the plastic wrap from his legs, patted him dry with a bath towel, then helped him up like moving heavy furniture.

Adrian swayed, gripping her slender shoulders for balance. Those delicate shoulders supported him steadily as they inched forward.

"Good thing we didn't bring the wheelchair in. The electronics would've gotten wet," Stella chattered nervously, eyeing the sophisticated mobility device.

Adrian stayed silent. He'd almost fallen into their old rhythm of banter. Just in time, he caught himself.

Back in the bedroom, he didn't turn around. "Satisfied now?"

Stella studied his dry skin. "Finish what you start. I'll go after you're settled."

Instantly, she regretted her tone—it sounded like obligatory duty. Thankfully Adrian didn't seem to notice, his gaze fixed on the nightstand—
###Chapter 426: Nowhere to Hide

The Polaroid photo that had been lying quietly in the drawer last night was now gone.

It was the only solace he had carried with him for years, the thing that had gotten him through countless dark moments.

In the entire Roland household, only two people could freely enter this study—himself and her.

Adrian Roland slowly lifted his gaze, his piercing eyes locking onto Stella Valentine standing at the door.

She instinctively clenched the hem of her shirt, afraid he would demand the photo back. Preemptively, she asked, "Do you need my help?"

"No."

After knowing each other for over a decade, he could read every micro-expression of hers.

Her forced composure was utterly transparent to him.

But he didn’t want her to know he still kept memories of her, either. He moved to the bed with deliberate slowness, his movements painfully sluggish.

Stella held her breath as she carefully supported his cast-bound leg, terrified of causing further injury. Only when she was sure he was settled did she exhale. "Rest first. I’ll go take a shower."

"Go be with the kids." He deliberately lowered his voice, trying to sound cold. But half-propped against the headboard, he only looked fragile.

Her shirt was still dripping, yet she stubbornly shook her head. "They’re already asleep."

"There are plenty of guest rooms."

"I’m afraid of the dark."

The excuse made Adrian’s breath hitch. If only she had said those words on their wedding night.

He suddenly met her eyes, his voice rough. "Do you know what that means?"

"I’ve always been afraid of the dark. You know that." She held his gaze, refusing to back down.

A silent standoff ended when Stella leaned over to tuck him in. As she turned to leave, she heard the faint sound of fabric tearing—his fingers were clenched tightly around the sheets.

In the children’s room, the three little ones slept soundly. Stella quietly fetched her pajamas, her heart aching as she looked at their innocent faces. If she couldn’t fix things this time…

The shower stopped soon after. When she returned to the bedroom, Adrian was already asleep. His thick lashes cast shadows under the bedside lamp, his breathing steady like a child’s.

She slipped into the empty half of the bed. This contradictory man—harsh words on his lips, yet he’d left the covers ready for her.

Moonlight filtered through the sheer curtains, outlining his gaunt frame. Unable to resist, Stella turned onto her side, studying the face that was both familiar and foreign. Prison had hollowed his cheeks and drained the color from his lips.

Her fingers hovered over his brow before gently smoothing out the crease there. "I’m sorry."

The man who should have been deep asleep opened his eyes in the dark.

He had wanted to say those words for so long. But between them lay too much blood and too many tears—even an apology couldn’t find the right moment.

The scent of jasmine lingered in the air as he wearily closed his eyes again.

In a daze, he dreamed of standing in the foyer in his school uniform. His grandfather sipped tea while reminding him to be careful, his mother stuffing star candies into his backpack. "Give these to little Stella."

Even his usually stern father smiled and said, "Don’t make her cry again."
###Chapter 427: Little Star, You're Finally Here

The dream street felt achingly familiar.

Adrian Roland pedaled that vintage bicycle, its chain clicking in the well-known rhythm. He pumped the pedals desperately, yet the destination he yearned for remained just out of reach.

A featherlight touch brushed his forehead.

His hand shot up instinctively, fingers closing around empty air—yet it felt like he'd grasped something priceless.

"Little Star, you're finally here." His voice came out rough with emotion.

In his memories, that perpetually late girl would always come bounding up to hop onto the rear seat, forcing him to pedal furiously to make their morning classes.

Stella Valentine froze mid-motion at his call.

"Yes, I'm here," she whispered back.

The corners of Adrian's lips lifted slightly as his breathing evened out. Clearly, his dream had given him the answer he sought.

Under the dim glow of the bedside lamp, Stella took in the dark circles beneath his eyes. His once healthy tan had faded to a concerning pallor, making his exhaustion even more pronounced.

She thought of the study light that had burned through countless nights.

So he hadn't been avoiding her.

Those mountains of documents, those endless midnight meetings—they were all to protect the Roland legacy. To protect her.

Stella rose carefully.

The study was strewn with open files. On top lay the jewelry design department's quarterly proposal, densely annotated in red.

Her phone screen lit up abruptly.

Vincent Astor's message blinked: Need design approval ASAP. Client demands morning meeting.

Glancing toward the bedroom, Stella powered on the computer.

Her heart clenched at the sight—the desktop still showed that starry sky wallpaper, the password unchanged from their anniversary date.

In the design software, a half-finished sketch waited patiently. It was a commemorative emblem for an international competition, requiring seasonal elements within strict budget constraints.

She texted Vincent back.

The callback came instantly.

"Mr. Roland, the client insists on seeing you personally—"

"He can't make it." Stella cut in. "Send me the draft sketches and sample photos."

After hanging up, she rummaged through drawers for reference materials. Her fingers brushed against familiar leather—that diary she thought was lost forever.

Stella drew a steadying breath before picking up the files.

At 3 AM, she added the final stroke. A delicate vine curling around the earring transformed the entire design.

Adrian's breathing remained undisturbed when she returned.

"Goodnight," she murmured before surrendering to sleep.

The alarm's vibration startled her awake.

Fumbling to silence it, Stella turned—

The sheets lay perfectly smooth beside her. Already cold.
###Chapter 428: Was He Pretending to Sleep?

Morning light filtered through the curtains as Stella Valentine jolted upright in bed.

She massaged her temples, the exhaustion from last night's design revisions still lingering. Her fingers brushed against the cold, empty sheets beside her, and she froze for a moment.

Splashing cold water on her face, she forced herself to focus. Grabbing a beige blazer, she rushed out without even applying eyeliner.

"Director Valentine!" Penny Anderson intercepted her at the elevator, forehead glistening with sweat. "The clients are furious in the conference room. They said they'll leave in ten minutes."

Stella checked her watch—9:15 AM.

"Tell them I brought a new proposal."

When she pushed open the glass doors, three clients were drumming impatient fingers on the table. The middle-aged man at the head scoffed, "Can't New Frontier Group even be punctual anymore?"

"Mr. Ellison." Stella set her laptop down. "My apologies for the delay. But this will make your wait worthwhile."

The clients' expressions froze as the screen illuminated.

Three designs unfolded sequentially—a rosebud unfurling at dawn, lilies basking in midday sun, and a withering night-blooming cereus embracing moonlight. Every petal's vein was meticulously rendered.

"Is this..." Mr. Ellison's hand hovered midair. "A rendering with South African diamonds?"

"No." Stella clicked to the next slide. "Synthetic crystals."

The room fell silent. Seeing the awe in their eyes, she exhaled slightly.

After signing contracts and seeing the clients out, Stella locked her office door. With trembling fingers, she opened the original design files—the cereus had been closed when she saved it last night.

Now it bloomed with heartbreaking intensity.

Her phone vibrated. Penny's message appeared: «Legal says the deposit cleared.»

Stella stared at the altered cereus. Only one person could access her encrypted files.

The sound of wheelchair wheels seemed to echo in her ears. She recalled someone tucking her in during her half-asleep haze last night.

The phone rang abruptly. The receptionist's panicked voice came through: "Director Valentine! There's a man claiming to be your husband—"

The glass door burst open. Penny's shriek and security's shouts blended together.

Stella looked up to see a suited man leaning on a cane in the doorway. The diamond tie pin on his silk tie refracted blinding sunlight.

It was her Stellaris Collection design from ten years ago.
###Chapter 429: Guilty Conscience

Stella Valentine was organizing meeting materials when the office door burst open.

Her head snapped up, fingers already hovering over the speed dial button.

Vincent Atlante swaggered in, his tailored suit failing to conceal his inherent vulgarity. He loosened his tie with a careless flick, smirking. "My dear sister-in-law, all alone? Where's my crippled brother?"

She set down her pen, gaze glacial. "You're not welcome here."

"Tsk, so cold." Vincent dropped into the chair opposite her, dress shoes propped on the conference table. "I came specially to visit my brother. Heard his legs..." He deliberately drew out the pause, "...are useless now?"

Stella shot to her feet, sending documents scattering across the floor.

"Get out." Her quiet voice carried steel.

Vincent spread his hands theatrically. "No need for hysterics. Actually, I should thank you. If you hadn't sent Adrian to prison, I wouldn't be enjoying this lifestyle." He leaned closer. "Everything that should've been mine from the start."

Stella's stomach churned at his features—identical to Adrian's yet repulsive.

"You're unworthy." Her laugh was brittle. "Grandfather gave you chances. You destroyed them yourself."

Vincent's face darkened. He slammed both palms on the table. "Spare me the sanctimony! The Rolands owe me, and I'll collect every last cent!" His expression shifted to leering. "Since Adrian's broken goods now, why not switch to me? We look the same. I don't mind being an instant father."

Stella hurled her coffee at him.

Brown liquid dripped down his expensive suit. Wiping his face, he chuckled. "Spicy. I like that."

"What do you want?" Stella clenched her fists. "Money? Shares? Or just to watch Adrian suffer?"

Vincent adjusted his cuffs with deliberate slowness. "Simple—everything." His eyes narrowed. "Including what the old man confessed before dying."

Stella's breath hitched.

That secret had haunted her. Vincent alone had been present during Edward Roland's final moments. While others dismissed the patriarch's ramblings, she'd always suspected Vincent withheld something.

"Name your price." She met his gaze squarely. "Tell me Grandfather's last words, and I'll meet any condition."

Vincent threw back his head in laughter that echoed through the empty room. Suddenly he seized her wrist, grip painfully tight.

"The old man said..." His breath scorched her ear, "...to give me the Roland empire. And you—"

"Lies!" Stella shoved him away violently.

Staggering back, Vincent smirked. "Don't believe me? Ask him yourself." He straightened his collar. "Oh wait—corpses can't talk."

As Stella glared, she noticed his pupils dilating.

"You're afraid." She advanced step by step. "Vincent Atlante, you've got a guilty conscience."

The air thickened.

Vincent's smirk faded. Lighting a cigarette, his trembling fingers betrayed him through the smoke.

"Three days." He exhaled sharply. "Bring me 20% of New Frontier Group's shares, and I'll reveal the old man's final words."

Stella scoffed. "You expect me to trust you?"

"Suit yourself." Vincent turned toward the door, pausing midstride. "But miss this chance, and you'll never know... how you really killed the old man."

The door clicked shut. Stella's legs buckled, hands braced against the table.

She would uncover the truth.
###Chapter 430: I Am the Real Adrian Roland

"How is that impossible?" Vincent's fingers tapped an irritating rhythm on the table. "Didn't you all swear to compensate me? Changing your minds already?"

His gaze slithered over Stella like a venomous snake.

Penny stepped between them. "Someone like you doesn't deserve compensation! What does the Roland family owe you? Should they be responsible forever for what your mother did?"

Vincent slammed the table, making the ashtray jump.

"Then what about my suffering?" He bared his teeth in a grin. "Since you're showing no mercy, don't blame me for what happens next. I will attend that memorial service."

Stella's fingers clenched beneath the table.

She knew exactly what Vincent intended. If he showed up at the memorial, Adrian's reputation would be ruined.

"Over my dead body," she said, her voice icy.

Vincent leaned in, his breath hot against her face. "Don't forget—right now, I'm 'Adrian Roland.' What if I suddenly appeared at a nightclub with some girls on my arms? Front page news—"

"Enough!" Stella shot to her feet. "You can go. But you will behave."

Vincent smirked in victory. As he turned to leave, he deliberately knocked over a vase on the coffee table.

Amid the shattering glass, he walked out without looking back.

"Stella..." Penny looked at her with concern.

Stella watched Vincent's retreating figure through the window. "Have him watched. On the day of the service, don't let him near the cemetery."

The memorial day arrived swiftly.

Stella stood by the window, watching her three children sitting properly dressed on the sofa.

"Mommy, will Great-Grandpa become the brightest star?" her youngest daughter asked, tilting her head up.

Stella knelt to adjust her collar. "Yes. He'll always watch over us."

As she stood, she noticed Ethan's worried gaze.

"Is Daddy okay?" the boy whispered.

Stella ruffled his hair. "I'll check on him."

In the next room, Adrian sat alone in his wheelchair. Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting fractured shadows across his pale face.

"Everything's arranged," he said without turning. "Vincent—"

"He's contained," Stella said softly. "You... take care of yourself."

Adrian's shoulders trembled almost imperceptibly.

Just then, Benjamin knocked urgently. "Stella, Ms. Fairsprene is here."

In the children's room, Joy pulled Stella into a fierce hug.

"You idiot!" She pounded Stella's back with tear-filled eyes. "How could you not tell me something this big happened?"

Stella finally let her tears fall.

She clung to her best friend like the only lifeline in a storm.
###Chapter 431: United in Grief

Stella Valentine's eyes were red-rimmed the moment Joy Fairsprene walked in. Joy stomped her foot in frustration. "Why must you be so stubborn? Raising three kids alone isn't enough? You had to handle this massive funeral too? If I hadn't come, would you have worked yourself to collapse?"

The children cheered at the sight of Joy. Luna rushed over and hugged her leg, looking up with wide eyes. "Don't worry, Mommy. We'll be good for Aunt Joy."

Ethan straightened his posture like a little gentleman. "I'll watch over my sisters."

Celeste quietly adjusted her small star-patterned backpack and stood beside her siblings. Inside were the thermos and hat Stella had packed, ensuring she wouldn’t catch a chill.

Stella's eyes welled up again at the sight of her thoughtful children and devoted friend. "Thank you. I’ll leave them to you."

"Since when do we stand on ceremony?" Joy waved her off. "Go change." She wanted to ask about Adrian Roland but swallowed the question when she saw Stella's downcast expression, settling for a tight hug instead.

Stella retreated to the guest room and slipped into a black dress suit. After a moment’s hesitation, she pinned a star brooch beside the white funeral flower. It was a statement—her duty as the Roland family’s matriarch.

Passing Adrian’s room, her steps slowed instinctively. The door stood ajar, revealing an empty space with curtains drawn tight.

"Looking for me?"

His voice behind her made her jump. She turned to find Adrian already dressed in a black suit, a white flower pinned to his lapel.

"It’s time to go." His tone was as casual as if discussing the weather.

Stella opened her mouth but only nodded silently. As she brushed past him, a faint trace of gardenia lingered in the air.

In the nursery, Joy had dressed the children. Luna and Celeste wore black dresses, while Ethan looked like a miniature version of Adrian in his tiny suit.

Stella’s breath caught at the resemblance. Kneeling, she adjusted their collars. "Let’s go."

Reporters swarmed outside the funeral home. Benjamin Langley wrung his hands. "Miss Stella, these journalists—"

"Let them take their pictures." Stella’s voice was steady. "Better to face them openly than hide." She turned to Joy. "The children are in your care."

The moment the car door opened, camera flashes erupted. A reporter shouted, "Mrs. Roland, why isn’t your husband attending his grandfather’s funeral? Rumors suggest—"

"Today is about honoring Grandpa." Stella’s calm gaze swept the crowd. "My husband and I are united in grief. Who attends makes no difference. Show some respect for the departed."

She moved through the throng with grace, the hem of her black dress swaying elegantly. The unspoken authority in her demeanor silenced the restless press.

Inside, an elderly man placed flowers before the portrait and sighed. "I was supposed to play chess with Old Mr. Roland..."

Stella handed him a handkerchief. "Grandpa wouldn’t hold it against you."

"You’re both good kids." He patted her hand. "Tell Adrian not to grieve too deeply. The Rolands still need him..."

Her fingers trembled slightly, but she maintained her smile. "I’ll pass that along."

In the corners, business elites had already shifted from mourning to networking. Unnoticed in the shadows, Adrian stood by the window, watching his grandfather’s portrait and Stella’s composed figure. His Adam’s apple bobbed with suppressed emotion.
###Chapter 432: Everything But Love

The white chrysanthemums in the funeral parlor were wilting. Adrian Roland gazed at the plane tree leaves drifting past the window, his fingers absently tracing the armrests of his wheelchair. His grandfather's final words—"Take care of yourself"—still echoed in his ears, yet here he was, pushing away the love of his life.

"Master Adrian has returned," Benjamin Langley pressed a glass of warm water into Stella Valentine's hands. "He doesn't look well."

Her fingers trembled around the glass. Adrian hadn't glanced at her once since the eulogy. The cup clinked sharply against the coffee table as she grabbed her coat and rushed out.

The master bedroom door stood ajar, the setting sun stretching the wheelchair-bound silhouette into a long shadow. Stella froze at the threshold, suddenly afraid to approach. His back looked frailer than three years ago, yet more resolute than ever.

"Does your leg still hurt?" She gently touched his shoulder.

He brushed her hand away. "The funeral's over."

Five icicle-sharp words stabbed her heart. Stella stared at her suspended hand, remembering how his Adam's apple had bobbed when she'd tied his tie that morning. Back then, his eyes still held warmth.

"The children start school next week. Their tutor arrives tomorrow." Adrian turned his wheelchair to face her. "You should leave."

A plane tree leaf spiraled onto the windowsill. Stella focused on that dead leaf as she heard herself say, "I was hired as a live-in nanny."

"Triple the severance pay."

"Adrian!" Her hands clenched the wheelchair arms. "Your grandfather's body isn't even cold yet, and you're throwing me out?"

The wheelchair jerked back half a meter. Adrian pressed pale knuckles to his forehead. "I'll assign someone to manage Shi's Jewelry. The Eastside villa is already under your name." When he looked up, his eyes were glacial. "Don't make me repeat myself."

Stella stumbled backward into a wardrobe. The metal handle dug into her spine, but the pain was nothing compared to his words. Not even during their divorce trial had he looked at her like this.

"What if I refuse?"

"Then we'll settle it in court." Adrian tossed a folder onto the bed. "The evidence of your unauthorized company fund transfers is enough for criminal charges."

Papers scattered across the floor. As Stella bent to gather them, she noticed every document bore his signature. He'd prepared this long ago—while she'd stayed up nights compiling his reports, while she'd massaged his legs during rehab.

"The children need their mother." Her grip turned the papers translucent.

"And what do I need?" Adrian suddenly lurched forward, the wheelchair screeching. "Stella, when you testified for Vincent, when you brawled for Joy, even when you paid some stranger's medical bills—" He slammed a fist against his paralyzed legs. "Why am I only worth your pity?"

Clouds swallowed the sunlight. Stella watched his trembling hands in the shadows, remembering how he'd whispered her name last night through pain-induced delirium. Now those same hands were shredding their future.

"We could start—"

"Enough!" Adrian hurled a bedside photo frame against the wall. Glass shattered as their wedding portrait split down the middle. "You won't even lie to me."

Shards skittered to Stella's feet. As she reached for the broken glass, a sliver sliced her finger. Blood dripped onto Adrian's smiling face in the photograph just as the wheelchair's motor whirred to life.

"Move out tomorrow." He paused at the door. "Or I'll call security now."

The click of the closing door finally broke her. Stella bit her lip bloody to silence her sobs, just as she'd done countless nights when he'd endured agony without complaint.

The cruelest revenge wasn't hatred—it was withholding even that.
###Chapter 433: Stella, Do You Even Understand?

Adrian's voice cut through the silence of the room like shattered glass.

He rarely spoke this much, but tonight it felt like he was pouring out years of pent-up emotions. Each word sliced through her carefully constructed defenses like a razor blade.

Did she still love him?

Stella's hand instinctively pressed against her chest, where her heart throbbed painfully.

She had loved Adrian. She had loved Mr. Alistair. Two heartbeats for the same man, both all-consuming passions.

Yet the bone-deep anguish felt just as real.

The endless nights waiting alone in that empty mansion. The words that had pierced her heart like daggers. All branded permanently into her memory.

"Forget it, little star." Adrian's voice suddenly dropped low. "Consider it granting me mercy."

Stella's head snapped up, meeting his hollow gaze.

"The children—"

"I'll handle it." He cut her off. "The new nanny is excellent."

"They're not me."

The words escaped before she could stop them, startling even herself.

Adrian's expression froze momentarily before hardening again. "You don't get to choose."

He knew her too well. Any more pleading and he might weaken.

Seeing the tension in Adrian's profile, Stella assumed he was still grieving his grandfather. She softened her tone. "About Grandfather Edward's matter, I promise—"

"Enough." His knuckles whitened on the wheelchair arms. "Just move out."

"It's late." Stella abruptly turned toward the bathroom. "I need to shower."

Her movements were crisp and efficient, as if their conversation never happened.

Adrian remained frozen until the sound of running water snapped him back to reality. With a frustrated jerk, he wheeled himself to the study.

When Stella entered the bedroom later wearing a face mask, Adrian had just finished reviewing documents.

"You—" His Adam's apple bobbed. "What exactly do you want?"

She calmly applied skincare products. "My work isn't done."

"You're fired."

"Termination notice?" She arched an eyebrow. "Without official documentation, I remain the Roland family nanny."

Adrian fell silent.

The room grew so quiet their breathing became audible.

"Thank you for that night." Stella spoke suddenly.

Adrian stiffened. "What?"

"The design revisions." She met his gaze directly. "They were perfect."

He turned away. "Don't know what you're talking about."

After packing her things, Stella paused at the doorway. "Goodnight."

The door clicked shut softly.

Adrian stared at the closed door, memories of that night flooding back.

Truth was, he'd woken when she left the bed.

He'd watched her work through the night until dawn.

When she turned, he'd shut his eyes hastily—pretending to sleep.

Too afraid to let her see his vulnerability.

Longing was a floodgate—once opened, there would be no stopping the deluge.
###Chapter 434: The Mark of Selfishness

At three in the morning, Adrian Roland jolted awake from another nightmare.

His hand instinctively reached for the other side of the bed, only to find cold emptiness.

Since Stella Valentine had moved back in, he’d grown accustomed to her warmth in the hazy space between sleep and wakefulness. Tonight, she wasn’t there.

A sliver of light seeped from under the study door.

Pushing his wheelchair silently closer, he found Stella slumped over her desk, asleep. The design on her screen remained unfinished, her lashes casting delicate shadows under the lamplight.

The cruel words he’d spat at her earlier resurfaced.

"We ended long ago."

"Stop deluding yourself."

Each syllable had been a blade—piercing her heart, and carving his own in the process.

The screen dimmed, reflecting his pallid face. As he moved to drape his jacket over her shoulders, her fingers suddenly closed around his wrist.

"You came." Her voice was thick with sleep, but her eyes burned bright.

Adrian recoiled as if scalded. "Just passing by."

"With my jacket?" She lifted the fallen garment with a faint smirk. "Since when did Mr. Roland learn to lie?"

He turned to leave, but she held his wheelchair in place.

"I can’t fix this design." She gestured at the screen. "The client needs it by tomorrow."

Adrian glanced at it. "Your color ratios are off."

"I know." She sighed. "But how do I adjust them?"

After a weighted pause, he wheeled closer. His fingers flew across the keyboard, and the design instantly transformed with vibrant precision.

Stella watched, mesmerized. "You always know how to perfect a piece."

"Commerce requires balance with art." His tone remained icy. "You’re too idealistic."

"So that’s why you forced me to practice calligraphy?" The sudden question stilled his hands. "To master that script?"

Dawn’s first light spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, etching his sharp profile in gold.

"Yes." The admission came quietly. "Pure selfishness."

He’d wanted to leave his mark on her. To ensure she’d never forget him.

Even if they became strangers, every stroke of her pen would carry his influence.

Stella laughed softly. "And now?"

"What?"

"Still selfish?"

Adrian’s throat tightened as he met her smiling eyes. In the morning glow, he saw his own reflection—the man who could never truly let go.

"About Penny Anderson..." She shifted topics. "Should I handle it as you suggested?"

"Yes." He looked away. "Let her choose."

Just as he was choosing now.

He could have walked away. Instead, he stayed beside her, refining this shared creation.

Selfishness be damned.

Somewhere along the way, Stella Valentine had become his inescapable fate.
###Chapter 435: The Wicked Meet Their Match

The air froze for several seconds.

How long had it been since they last talked about the past so calmly?

This moment felt too precious to ruin.

Adrian broke the silence first. "I never blamed you for what happened to Grandfather. Going to prison was my own choice."

Stella's smile faded slightly. "I know you compensated for everything Vincent stole—and more. You didn't have to go in."

"Yeah."

"Then why..." She bit her lip. "Was it because of me?"

"Partly."

"To atone?"

"Not entirely." His gaze dropped. "No matter what I do, I can't undo the harm I caused you. You almost died, and I..."

Her heart clenched.

"I was useless." He gave a self-deprecating laugh. "Seeing you with Vincent, I just..."

"Adrian..."

When he looked up, his eyes held a quiet light. "Pathetic, right? And... not all those things were stolen by Vincent."

"What?"

"The wedding dress." His voice softened. "That night, when my memories returned, I rushed to find you. I passed a bridal shop and saw a gown that looked like it was woven from stars..."

Stella's pupils contracted.

"The store was closed, but I couldn't wait..." His voice trailed off. "So I smashed the display window."

Her breath caught.

He'd regained all his memories?

"When?"

"The night Vincent took you."

A chill ran through her. "You were at the hotel?"

"I had the dress..." His smile turned bitter. "Then I saw you with Vincent—"

"Nothing happened!" she cut in urgently. "He's a madman!"

"I know..."

"You really remember everything?"

"Yeah."

"How?"

He avoided her eyes. "It just... came back."

"That's all?"

"That's all."

Stella studied him. "What about your leg?"

"Motorcycle accident."

"Liar." Her eyes reddened. "Mr. Alistair did the same thing. First said he hurt his arm on a rock, then admitted it was from the crash."

Adrian suddenly met her gaze. "I only lied to you about one thing."

"..."

"When I said I stopped loving you."

......

"Is that a confession?" Joy poked at her lemon slice. "What do you think?"

Stella stirred her coffee silently.

Adrian was home today, attending a video conference—and adamant she shouldn't stay up late.

"Honestly," Joy sighed, "after how he treated you for Lily, he deserves to rot. But knowing he's Mr. Alistair makes it..."

"Let it unfold naturally."

"Oh!" Joy suddenly slammed the table. "Lily got her sentence reduced!"

"What?"

"Vincent withdrew the lawsuit in Adrian's name!" Joy gritted her teeth. "He did it on purpose!"

Stella tightened her grip on the cup. "What about Victor?"

"Ha. Vincent won't let him off easy." Joy smirked. "The wicked meet their match."

Just as Stella relaxed slightly, her phone rang.

"Ms. Valentine!" The receptionist sounded panicked. "A woman with a baby is here causing a scene—accusing you of being the other woman! The press is everywhere!"
###Chapter 436: The Spectacle of the Century

The plaza before Brilliant Star Group headquarters swarmed with people.

Stella Valentine's car was trapped a hundred meters away, unable to move an inch. Camera flashes erupted like lightning, illuminating the entire street.

"Oh my god!" Joy Fairsprene pressed against the car window. "Is this a press conference?"

Stella's lips pressed into a thin line.

She didn't need to guess who was behind this. Brilliant Star Group had always maintained a low profile. Since her father's death, that spineless Victor Lefèvre wouldn't dare offend even a street thug. Only one relentless enemy could orchestrate such a spectacle.

"Joy, stay in the car."

"No way! That lunatic Lily Savigny is capable of anything!"

Stella unbuckled her seatbelt. "She's here for me."

The back entrance stood empty.

The receptionist paced anxiously. "Ms. Valentine! That woman is kneeling at the main entrance with a child, claiming you're trying to drive them to ruin—"

"How long?"

"Nearly two hours. More reporters keep arriving. We can't stop them."

Stella removed her coat. "Bring a chair to the entrance."

"Pardon?"

"One with a backrest."

Camera flashes descended like torrential rain.

Squinting against the glare, Stella strode toward the prepared chair. She sat gracefully, crossing her legs as she surveyed the farce unfolding below the steps.

Lily Savigny knelt with disheveled hair, her white dress stained with dirt. Beside her, a gaunt boy stared vacantly like a wooden puppet.

"Stella Valentine!" Lily suddenly lunged forward. "Are you satisfied after reducing us to this?"

The boy stumbled as she yanked his arm.

"How old is he?" Stella asked abruptly.

Lily faltered. "Th-three and a half! He's Adrian Roland's flesh and blood! The Roland family must acknowledge him!"

Reporters erupted in murmurs.

Stella smiled faintly. "Does Adrian know about this?"

"Of course! He promised at the funeral!" Lily shrieked. "Even beasts care for their young! Don't think you can deny it!"

Flashbulbs exploded in frenzy.

"Mrs. Roland, what are your thoughts on your husband's illegitimate child?"
"Is it true you framed this woman and sent her to prison?"
"Will the child be brought into the Roland household?"

Questions flooded like tidal waves.

Beneath the trees, Vincent Astor gripped the wheelchair handles. "Sir, Madam is—"

Adrian Roland raised a hand to silence him. His gaze remained fixed on the straight-backed figure at the center of the storm, dark currents swirling in his eyes.

"Let her handle it."
###Chapter 437: She Was Never Weak

Whispers surged through the crowd like waves.

"Rich people's marriages are all for show. Lovey-dovey on TV, but playing around behind the scenes."

"A man like Adrian Roland would never settle for just one woman."

"That poor kid. They can't just ignore Roland family blood, can they?"

"Can't you see? This couple teamed up to send that mother and child to prison! Look how filthy the boy is—does it seem like he's been cared for?"

"Women can be so cruel. Even targeting a child..."

The murmurs rose and fell.

Vincent clenched his fists. "Boss, I'll—"

Before he could finish, Stella's cool voice came through the microphone.

Her figure was blocked by reporters, but her composed tone carried clearly. "Since Adrian agreed, I have no objections. But I'm curious—if he truly consented, why didn't he send someone to bring you back to the Roland estate? Why let you cause a scene here at Shi's Jewelry?"

The crowd fell silent instantly.

Adrian was now the head of the Roland family. If he'd really approved, why would this mother and son need to make a spectacle?

Lily Savigny hastily defended, "He's too busy. He'll come for us soon."

"Fine. Then we'll wait together." Stella chuckled. "I'd love to ask him what he means by this."

Lily froze.

How could Stella dare to wait when she knew about Vincent Atlante's existence?

"Prepare refreshments for the reporters," Stella instructed the receptionist. "They've worked hard. Who knows how long this will take."

Though confused, the receptionist complied.

"And bring a chair for the child," Stella added. "Adults can kneel all they want, but children's bones are still soft."

Snacks were quickly distributed.

As the little boy reached for a pastry, Stella stopped him. "Wait."

Lily immediately shrieked, "Won't even spare a snack?"

"His hands are dirty. Clean them first." Stella personally wiped the child's hands with a wet wipe, speaking gently. "Now you can eat."

The boy happily devoured the treat.

"Mrs. Roland is so attentive to the child..."

"Meanwhile, his real mother only cares about arguing..."

The whispers turned Lily's face livid. She slapped the pastry from the boy's hands. "Don't eat that! Who knows if it's poisoned!"

The child rolled his eyes and swung his legs idly.

"Miss Savigny," Stella's voice turned icy. "Take your anger out on me. What kind of person bullies a child?"

"Stop pretending!"

"At least I wouldn't humiliate a child in front of the media." Stella met Lily's gaze. "What will his classmates think? You brought him here just to pressure me. He's been kneeling for an hour—hungry and exhausted—while you only care about venting?"

Lily had no retort.

"Also," Stella continued, "you claim we sent you to prison. Which prison? What was your cell number? How long were you there?"

"Houston Women's Prison! Four years—"

Stella crouched to the boy's level. "How old are you?"

He held up four fingers.

"Four years old." She stood. "So you were pregnant when you entered prison?"

"Yes! You didn't even spare a pregnant woman—"

Stella smirked. "If we really wanted to silence you, would we have let you give birth? Without this child, your accusations would be baseless. How could you cause such a scene?"

Lily gritted her teeth. "You'll see when Adrian gets here!"

"Fine." Stella suddenly raised her voice. "If he acknowledges you, I'll surrender my children's inheritance rights to your son."

From the shadows, Adrian's lips curved. "Seems we don't need to intervene."

Vincent had an epiphany. "Mrs. Roland's move is brilliant."

Vincent Atlante coveted the Roland fortune most of all. Now, how could he possibly admit this mother and son? Such a juicy prize—he'd want it all for himself.

"Mrs. Roland is too clever," Vincent marveled.

Adrian's gaze softened. "She was never weak."
###Chapter 438: The Unfathomable Human Heart

"Vincent, prepare the car."

Vincent hesitated. "Sir, leaving now? What if Vincent Atlante shows up—"

Adrian Roland ran his fingers along the wheelchair armrest. "Vincent is nothing but a clown. It's time to reel in the real catch."

Vincent's breath hitched.

Mr. Xavier Atlante had been silent for too long. Since Vincent Atlante's appearance, the once-powerful old man had vanished without a trace. Not even Edward Roland's death or Adrian's imprisonment had drawn him out.

This was beyond unusual.

"Should we mobilize additional personnel?"

"Unnecessary."

"Understood."

The seaside villa basked in the midday sun. Mr. Xavier sat motionless on the wicker chair in the courtyard, his back to the entrance—a statue frozen in time.

The crunch of tires on gravel alerted the servants.

"Mr. Roland." A servant bowed.

Adrian glanced up. "Has Uncle Xavier had lunch?"

"Yes, sir. He's sunbathing now."

"Dismissed."

The servant retreated without a sound.

Salty sea air rushed past them. Adrian's gaze landed on the old man's bare wrists.

"Where are your prayer beads and walnuts, Uncle?"

Xavier kept his eyes on the horizon. "Pointless. All just lies."

"The Buddha would disapprove."

Xavier scoffed. "I burned the first incense every New Year. Donated millions. And what did it get me? Two ungrateful snakes."

Two snakes.

Grant Rubenstein. Adrian Roland.

Vincent wheeled Adrian forward until they sat side by side.

"Uncle, the gods are watching."

"Indeed." Xavier suddenly turned. "Adrian, how have I treated you?"

"You once said you saw me as your own."

"I gave you everything. Did I not know Grant's ambitions? But I chose you." The old man's bony fingers clenched the armrests. "Where did I fail you?"

"Nowhere."

"How many times did I warn you? Women bring ruin. Yet you threw yourself into Stella Valentine's fire. Look at you now—confined to a wheelchair in your prime!"

Adrian narrowed his eyes against the glittering sea. "My failure, not yours."

"Had you listened, none of this would've happened."

"And had you not hinted for Lily Savigny to tamper with my parents' car, you're right—it wouldn't have."

Xavier's eyes bulged. "What nonsense! The investigation proved—"

"Still acting?" Adrian's voice remained calm. "I don't trust Lily. But I'm not blind. She couldn't have hidden those wrecked Land Rovers for five years alone."

"Slander!"

"I had doubts when we found the vehicles. I just didn't want to believe them."

Xavier burst into laughter. "Proof? I saved you twice! Is this your gratitude?"

"Three lives. How will you repay that debt?"

"You have no evidence!" Xavier rasped. "Even if you did, how many years would abetment get me? At my age, medical parole would be effortless."

"Flawless calculations." Adrian smiled faintly. "Let Lily take the fall while you walk free."

"That's called securing an exit! Adrian, let this be your final lesson—never gamble your life for a woman!"

"Stella and I are none of your concern." Adrian's gaze turned glacial. "I repaid your 'kindness' with this arm. But blood debts—"

"What can you do? Call the police?" Xavier sneered. "This villa is filled with my men!"

"Times have changed."

A crisp clap echoed. The servant reappeared.

"Mr. Roland."

"Give the chef leave. Everyone else stays." Adrian's tone was indifferent. "Ensure Uncle Xavier takes his medication—every single dose."

"Understood. The old master's dementia causes him to refuse meals. We'll do our best."

Xavier trembled. "You bribed my staff? To starve me?"

"You calculated everything—how my parents' deaths would turn Stella against me, how threatening my life would drive her away, how greed would corrupt Lily and her mother." Adrian signaled Vincent to wheel him out. "But you never accounted for betrayal from those closest to you. That's human nature."
###Chapter 439: Everyone Only Lives Once

Vincent helped Adrian into the car, his fingers trembling slightly.

In the rearview mirror, his boss's gaze was icy cold.

Even during the most demanding work situations, Adrian had never worn such an expression.

"Do I scare you?" Adrian suddenly spoke.

Vincent shook his head vigorously and quickly started the engine.

"Vincent."

"Yes, sir?"

"Do you think I was too cruel to an old man?"

Vincent's grip on the steering wheel tightened.

Adrian stared out the window. "Stella and I lost nine years. A full nine years."

His voice was soft, but sharp as a blade.

"How many lives has Uncle Xavier ruined? My parents, Stella's father..." Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "They should have watched Ethan and Luna grow up."

The car fell into an oppressive silence.

"If Uncle Xavier were twenty years younger," Adrian sneered, "I would have made him pay a hundredfold."

Vincent held his breath.

"In five days, go to the beach house," Adrian abruptly ordered.

"Yes, sir."

"Bring Damian with you."

"Understood."

——

Outside the Shi's Jewelry building, Lily knelt until her knees went numb.

Stella sat under a parasol, calmly revising a design sketch. A little boy devoured pastries beside her.

The reporters grew restless.

"Miss Savigny, is Mr. Roland coming or not?"

"Be patient!" Lily gritted her teeth. "He'll be here any minute!"

"You must have some proof, right?"

The crowd suddenly stirred.

"Mr. Roland is here!"

Stella closed her laptop and approached the approaching Vincent Atlante.

"Your son is well taken care of," she said with a smile.

Vincent's eyes darkened. "You've been very attentive, Mrs. Roland."

"It's my pleasure." Her smile deepened. "Just acknowledge them, and I'll transfer all three children's inheritance to your son immediately."

Lily rushed forward and clung to Vincent's arm. "Adrian!"

"Get off me!" Vincent shoved her away. "I don't know this woman!"

Lily's face turned deathly pale. "But you said—"

"Everyone, disperse!" Vincent barked. "This woman is mentally unstable!"
###Chapter 440: Blood Demands Blood

Adrian Roland's icy voice cut through the air, bringing the farce to an end.

The journalists whispered among themselves as they dispersed, their gazes shifting from pity to contempt when they glanced at Lily Savigny.

Lily's face turned ghostly pale. Trembling, she clutched Vincent Atlante's sleeve. "You were the one who told me to do this!"

"Shut up!" Vincent shoved her away. "Get out of here."

A flash of venom crossed Lily's eyes. "You're cutting the rope after crossing the river—"

"Adrian," Stella Valentine suddenly spoke, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Miss Savigny has been kneeling outside with her child for so long. Let her come in and rest."

Vincent narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "Have you lost your mind?"

"A mother can't bear to see a child suffer." Stella gently touched her slightly rounded belly.

"Spare me the act," Vincent sneered. "Since when did you become so hypocritical?"

Stella's smile deepened. "I learned from the best. No wonder Miss Savigny enjoys this game so much."

Vincent's expression darkened. "Did Adrian teach you this?"

"What?"

"Using the shares to threaten me?" Vincent gritted his teeth. "He's really pulling out all the stops to keep me from getting the Roland family's assets."

Stella's smile vanished. "You already took half of the Roland fortune. Your greed knows no bounds."

"That was what I deserved! The Rolands owe me far more than that!"

Ignoring him, Stella crouched down and spoke softly to the little boy. "Would you like to come inside for some snacks?"

The boy nodded timidly.

Stella took his hand and led him into the building. She turned to the receptionist. "Take care of this child. As for the woman outside..." She paused. "Escort her to the conference room."

Inside the conference room, Lily fidgeted nervously.

When Stella entered, Lily shot to her feet. "What do you want?"

"To talk." Stella sat across from her. "About the four lives you helped destroy."

Lily's face drained of color. "I don't know what you're talking about..."

"Don't you?" Stella pulled a file from her bag. "Bank transfers to Vincent. Recordings of your schemes."

Lily trembled. "How... how did you get these?"

"Did you really think Vincent trusted you?" Stella's laugh was cold. "He had insurance from the start."

In the office, Penny Anderson handed Stella a list. "Miss Valentine, Mr. Roland sent these gemstones."

Stella skimmed through it. "Tell him I'll settle the payment as soon as possible."

"He said there's no rush—"

"Business is business." Stella cut her off. "I don't want to owe him favors."

Penny hesitated. "He's actually very worried about you—"

A knock interrupted her.

The receptionist hurried in. "Miss Valentine, a client is here to collect a debt. It's an unpaid order from Mr. Sun."

Stella rubbed her temples. "Take him to the VIP lounge."

"Is Vincent still outside?"

"He left. Lily is still in the conference room."

Stella nodded. "Send her some refreshments."

Penny frowned. "Why show her kindness?"

Stella's eyes turned glacial. "Four lives demand repayment in blood. Death is too merciful. I want her to suffer."
###Chapter 441: SOS, Come Quick!

The sharp click of high heels echoed through the corridor.

Stella Valentine strode toward the VIP lounge, already hearing the shrill female voice inside.

"Shi's Jewelry is a scam! You took my money but won't deliver! I'm reporting you to the Consumer Council!"

Penny Anderson clutched her phone, typing frantically: [SOS, come quick!]

"Give me that." Stella plucked the phone from her hands. "I'll handle this."

"But Stella—"

"Time to face things myself." She took a deep breath and pushed open the lounge door.

A crystal ashtray came flying at her face.

Stella sidestepped just in time. The ashtray shattered against the wall, spraying glass shards.

"Watch out!" Penny gasped.

At the room's center stood a middle-aged woman caked in makeup, dripping with jewelry, her overpowering perfume filling the air.

"Well, if it isn't Mrs. Roland finally gracing us with her presence?" The woman sneered. "Marrying into money really changes people, doesn't it?"

Stella remained composed. "Mrs. Blanchet, please have a seat."

"Save it!" Jessica Blanchet slammed the table. "Deliver my order or pay up! The contract clearly states tenfold compensation!"

She waved a hand glittering with rings in Stella's face.

Penny muttered, "Her fingers might snap under all that weight..."

Stella cleared her throat in warning.

"Mrs. Blanchet, we'll deliver within three days with additional compensation. Would that suffice?"

"Too late!" Jessica scoffed. "Who wears four-year-old designs nowadays? I'd be embarrassed to regift them!"

"What compensation would you prefer then?"

"A public apology! Emotional damages! Reputation damages!" Jessica jabbed a finger at her. "Don't think your marriage license makes you untouchable!"

Penny flushed with anger, but Stella gripped her wrist.

A phone buzzed. Adrian's message appeared: [Hugo's mistress is a jewelry designer. Your age.]

Stella's eyes flickered.

Another message followed: [Every client's anger has a root cause. Find it.]

Understanding dawned.

"Mrs. Blanchet," Stella smiled, "I heard Vogue's circulation has been declining?"

Jessica's face twisted. "None of your business!"

"I have unreleased designs for a new collection." Stella remained calm. "Featured in Vogue, they might reverse your fortunes."

"You?" Jessica sneered.

"If successful, you revive your magazine. If not, you still get compensation." Stella held her gaze. "A no-lose proposition. Care to consider?"

Silence fell over the lounge.
###Chapter 442: Not as Pretty or Cultured as You

Mrs. Blanchet absently twisted the massive diamond on her ring finger, her lips curling into a sneer. "Who said anything about divorce? My husband and I are perfectly happy. Don't go spreading rumors!"

Stella Valentine simply smiled without responding.

"You there!" Mrs. Blanchet suddenly turned her attention to Penny. "Are you Mrs. Roland's assistant?"

Penny, who had been seething with anger, immediately straightened. "Yes. Is there a problem?"

Mrs. Blanchet frowned. "Mrs. Roland, where did you find this assistant? She has no manners! You're the ones who owe me money. Don't you know how to behave?"

"Mrs. Blanchet, please calm down—"

"I'm perfectly calm," Mrs. Blanchet scoffed. "But keeping such an insolent assistant will only cause trouble. Fire her and find someone more obedient. Otherwise, who would dare work with you?"

Penny turned away, fuming.

Stella's eyes flickered. She turned to Penny and said softly, "Go check on Lily Savigny."

"Isn't security already handling her? I should stay here with you."

"Mrs. Blanchet is a cultured woman. What could possibly happen?" Stella gave a meaningful smile. "I'd feel better if you went."

Understanding the hint, Penny nodded. "Call me if you need anything, Mrs. Roland."

Once Penny was out of earshot, Mrs. Blanchet lowered her voice. "Why does she call you 'Mrs. Roland'? Shouldn't it be 'Ms. Valentine'?"

Stella realized the slip but remained composed. "She used to be Adrian's secretary. She was recently reassigned to assist me."

Mrs. Blanchet looked skeptical. "A young girl becoming Mr. Roland's secretary? She must be quite cunning. Mrs. Roland, I'm only saying this because I like you—be careful."

Stella couldn't help but laugh. "You're overthinking it. She and I get along quite well."

Mrs. Blanchet's expression darkened. "Mark my words, you'll regret it. By the way, you two have three children together, yet you still call him by his full name?"

"We've been..."

"Fighting?" Mrs. Blanchet nodded knowingly. "Marital disputes leave the door wide open for other women. My Hugo once argued with me, and some little vixen swooped right in."

After a few exchanges, Stella had Mrs. Blanchet figured out.

She was blunt and sharp-tongued but not malicious. She and Hugo had been married for decades without major issues—her abrasive personality and a mistress's sweet talk had likely led to his momentary lapse in judgment.

Mrs. Blanchet abruptly changed the subject. "That woman making a scene earlier—Lily Savigny?"

"Yes."

"Not as pretty as you, and her demeanor is lacking."

Stella smiled. "Thank you."

"But men are superficial," Mrs. Blanchet said coldly. "No matter how accomplished a woman is, she can't compete with a seductress's sweet whispers."

Stella chose her words carefully. "Mrs. Blanchet, what are your plans moving forward?"

Noticing the shift in the other woman's expression, Stella tactfully changed the subject. "To be honest, Shi's Jewelry has struggled in recent years and owes quite a few debts. But I want to revive my father's legacy, so I've designed a collection inspired by classical aesthetics. I was hoping to collaborate with your magazine."

Her tone was sincere, her explanation clear and thorough, demonstrating genuine commitment.

Mrs. Blanchet's expression softened slightly. "Young lady, it's not as simple as you think—"

Before she could finish, the VIP room door burst open.

Lily barged in, dragging a crying child behind her. Spotting Mrs. Blanchet, she immediately cried out, "Madam, you're here to collect a debt too, right? We're on the same side!"

Mrs. Blanchet recoiled in disgust. "Who's on your side?"

"I'm Adrian Roland's woman!" Lily shoved the child forward. "This is his son! Stella Valentine went back on her word and won't let father and son reunite. You tell me—is that fair?"
###Chapter 443: Can't You Tell? I'm Talking About You

Stella Valentine arched an eyebrow at Penny Anderson.

Penny shrugged helplessly, gesturing that she couldn't stop what was happening.

"Mr. Roland publicly denied the rumors in the press," Jessica Blanchet interjected sharply.

Lily Savigny's voice turned shrill. "Adrian only said that to protect the company's reputation! He loves me! Stella will be thrown out soon—don't you dare collaborate with her!"

Penny stomped her foot in frustration. "Have you no shame, Lily? After Stella took you and your son in, this is how you repay her?"

Stella watched the scene unfold with icy detachment.

Jessica let out a derisive laugh. "So you're just a cheap mistress. If you're so bold, go make a scene at New Frontier Group. Bullying the legal wife only proves how pathetic you are."

Lily's face twisted. She yanked her son forward. "Why should my child be treated as less than Stella's?"

"Your son is crying because you're hurting him," Jessica retorted, rolling her eyes.

The boy wrenched free and hid behind Penny.

"Get back here!" Lily shrieked.

Penny shielded him. "Do you even deserve to be called a mother? Forcing your child to kneel in public—have you considered his feelings?"

"I'm fighting for what's rightfully ours!"

Jessica's voice turned glacial. "A mistress has no right to speak of what's 'rightful.' Selling your body for money makes you no better than a prostitute."

Stella tugged lightly at Jessica's sleeve.

"Don't stop me," Jessica snapped, shaking her off. "Miss Valentine, I've decided to work with you. Send me your designs—they'll grace the cover of our next issue."

Stella's eyes lit up. "Thank you."

"Call me Editor Blanchet," Jessica said, lifting her chin. "I'll make sure the entire fashion industry remembers Stella Valentine."

Penny beamed. "Editor Blanchet, you're a true heroine!"

"Aren't you afraid of being fired?" Jessica arched a brow.

"Who needs a scumbag boss?" Penny thumped her chest. "I'm sticking with Stella to do great things!"

Jessica nodded approvingly before hurrying off with a final instruction: "Send the designs by afternoon. Double our sales, and we'll call it even."

As Jessica left, Penny circled Lily mockingly. "Thanks to you, we secured the deal so quickly."

"You—"

"Filthy little cockroach~" Penny hummed cheerfully.

Lily screeched. "Who are you calling that?!"

Stella smiled faintly. "Can't you tell?"

Her voice was soft but razor-sharp.

"I'm talking about you."
###Chapter 444 I Don't Want to See This

"Did you lock me in here just to humiliate me?" Lily Savigny's face turned ashen.

Stella Valentine calmly straightened the documents on her desk. "No. I just wanted you to experience how it feels to be publicly exposed."

"You—"

"You've been acting for years. It's my turn now." Stella lifted her gaze. "Did you really think this farce could hurt me?"

Lily sneered. "If not this time, then next time. Stella Valentine, just you wait."

"Unnecessary." Stella's voice remained steady. "The evidence of your three murders is irrefutable. You got lucky last time. Not this time."

"Hahaha!" Lily suddenly burst into laughter. "You think the law can touch me? Vincent Atlante set me free! As long as he says the word, I walk out anytime!"

Stella's fingers paused briefly before continuing to arrange the desk ornaments. "Do you know why Vincent let you out?"

"Of course." Lily tilted her chin up triumphantly. "He wants to torment you. But I don't mind—as long as it makes you suffer."

Penny Anderson stormed forward. "You're insane! Aren't you afraid of karma?"

"Karma?" Lily shot her a disdainful glance. "I don't even care about my life. What do I care about karma?"

"You had a child just to evade justice?"

Lily turned back to Stella. "Is this your new secretary? Quite the sharp tongue."

"None of your damn business!" Penny glared. "Get out! Don't dirty our office!"

"Don't worry, I'm leaving." Lily reached the door and turned with a venomous smile. "Stella Valentine, just wait. Thinking you can rebuild the Shi empire? Dream on!"

The door slammed shut behind her.

Penny stomped her foot in frustration. "Stella! You just let her go?"

"The press is swarming outside." Stella rubbed her temples. "If she walks out injured, tomorrow's headline will be about me abusing a pregnant woman."

"But what if she keeps coming back to harass us—"

"Focus on Editor Blanchet's order first." Stella opened her laptop. "Notify the tech department. I'll send the designs tonight."

Penny trudged out reluctantly. "The heavens must be blind..."

Silence reclaimed the office.

Stella stared at the screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard. Vincent's move was ruthless—releasing Lily to torment her while he lurked in the shadows.

All of this stemmed from the identity she'd once given him.

Amid the rhythmic tapping of keys, she forced herself to concentrate. The fate of Shi's Jewelry hinged on this deal.

......

Outside the company, Lily spat viciously on the ground.

Noticing the little boy still eating the pastry, she slapped it from his hands. "Disgusting brat! How dare you eat her food?"

The pastry rolled into the flowerbed, coated in dirt.

The boy lowered his head silently.

"What are you staring at? Everything she gives is—"

Before she could finish, a grimy hand suddenly snatched the pastry and wolfed it down.

"Filthy beggar! Get lost!"

The beggar looked up with clouded eyes. "Lily..."

She recoiled two steps. "Who the hell are you?"

"It's me... your father!"

Victor Lefèvre lunged to grab her. "Sweetheart, I'm so hungry..."

"Don't touch me!" Lily shrieked, shaking him off. "Stay away!"

"You used to call me Daddy..."

Lily scoffed. "Back when you had money. Now?" Her contemptuous gaze swept over his tattered clothes. "You're not even worth a stray dog!"
###Chapter 445: Four Extra Years Were a Gift

Victor Lefèvre's stomach growled. He lunged at Lily Savigny like a starving wolf. "Money... give me money... I'm starving..."

Lily dodged with disgust, her red lips curling into a venomous sneer. "Good! Starve to death! My mother must have been blind to think you were reliable! Go beg your precious niece for money—she's right inside!"

Victor's bloodshot eyes turned toward the New Frontier Group building.

This had once been his kingdom.

Here, he had commanded respect, basking in the admiration of his subordinates.

"This is mine... all of it!"

"Too bad you were too stupid to keep it," Lily taunted. "Stella Valentine took it all back. Otherwise, you'd still be living in luxury."

Just then, Stella emerged from the building, carrying a laptop.

Her tailored business suit accentuated her elegance with every movement.

Lily leaned close to Victor, her voice dripping with malice. "See that? A single piece of her jewelry could feed you for months. That watch, those earrings, those shoes... take them, and you'll never have to worry again."

Victor's breathing turned ragged, his eyes wild with desperation.

"She stole all of that from you," Lily goaded. "Go on—rip it off her. Take back what's yours!"

With a feral roar, Victor charged at Stella.

Lily excitedly raised her phone, ready to capture the spectacle—

A hand knocked the phone from her grasp.

She whirled around, fury twisting her face—until she saw who stood before her. Her entire body trembled. "M-Mr. Atlante..."

The man's icy gaze could cut through steel.

Lily stammered, "Mr. Atlante, this wasn't my fault! We agreed to deal with Stella together—why are you backing out now?"

Silence. The air around him turned frigid.

Lily paled. "I-I'll try again tomorrow! I'll make Stella hand over her shares! Just... please don't send me back to prison..."

A familiar figure approached. "Boss, we've got him restrained."

"Send him to the psychiatric ward."

"Yes, sir."

"And her?"

"Already in the car. Guards are watching her discreetly."

"Don’t let her notice."

"Understood."

Lily's pupils shrank in realization. "You're not Vincent Atlante... You're—"

Adrian Roland didn't even glance at her. "Clean this up," he ordered Vincent Astor.

Vincent bowed. "Yes, sir."

A wheelchair was brought over, and Vincent carefully helped Adrian into it. "Rest in the car, sir. We'll handle this quickly."

Adrian frowned. "Make it swift."

"Understood."

Only then did Lily realize she was surrounded.

"What are you doing?" Her voice shook.

Vincent smirked. "The boss said to be 'swift.' As long as you're alive, Mrs. Roland will never have peace."

"Vincent Atlante forced me into this! Go after him!"

"He won't escape either." Vincent cracked his knuckles. "Lily Savigny, those four extra years were a gift. Time to pay it back."

"You wouldn't dare! We're in public!"

Vincent signaled the bodyguards. "We're law-abiding citizens. Everything will be done legally."

Lily was forced to the ground, shrieking. "Let me go! Vincent will save me! Ugh—"

A rag was shoved into her mouth. "Too noisy," Vincent muttered in disgust.

As the guards hauled her into a car, Vincent climbed in last. "To the police station."

One of his men hesitated. "Vincent Atlante might bail her out."

Vincent stared out the window at the passing scenery. Softly, he said, "That's why the boss said... to be 'swift.'"
###Chapter 446: The Mother of New Frontier Group's Future Heir

A ceramic cup whizzed past Stella Valentine's hair the moment she stepped into the magazine office.

"Watch out!" The assistant secretary yanked her aside just in time.

The cup shattered against the wall, sending fragments flying.

Heated arguments spilled from the conference room, the soundproof glass failing to contain the tension.

Stella tightened her grip on the design drafts in her hand. She could've emailed them to Editor-in-Chief Jessica Blanchet, but the production department's urgent deadline forced her to make this trip.

"Chief Editor, Ms. Valentine is here," the secretary announced loudly while knocking.

The shouting ceased abruptly.

The door swung open to reveal a potbellied man blocking the entrance. His keychain jingled against his belt buckle as he glared at Stella with hostility.

"Get lost! Can't you see we're in a meeting?"

The secretary shrugged helplessly. "Ms. Valentine, perhaps you could wait in the lounge—"

"Come in," Jessica's voice called from inside.

The man barred Stella's path. "Who the hell are you? If you breathe a word about what you heard today, you'll regret it!"

Stella smiled faintly. "Are you threatening me?"

"Hugo!" Jessica rushed over, shielding Stella. "This is Mrs. Roland—the mother of New Frontier Group's future heir!"

The man's face froze.

"A-Adrian Roland?" His voice trembled.

Seizing the moment, Jessica dashed back into the conference room, signed the divorce papers with furious strokes, and flung them at the man's face. "See you at the civil registry tomorrow!"

The man fled, his jangling keys marking his retreat down the hallway.

Silence finally returned to the office.

"Sorry you had to witness that." Jessica wiped her face. "I owe you one—that bastard wouldn't have backed off otherwise."

Stella gave a wry smile. "In the end, I still had to use his name."

"When Mr. Roland acquired companies back then, who in Houston didn't fear him?" Jessica handed her a steaming cup of tea. "But... you weren't in the country at the time?"

Stella lowered her eyes as steam curled between them.

The secretary burst in suddenly. "Chief Editor! Mr. Roland's car just pulled up downstairs!"

Jessica shot Stella a meaningful look. "Seems someone's worried about you."

Stella's fingers absently traced the rim of her cup. Three years had passed. She'd believed herself strong enough now, yet that man's shadow still clung to her like a second skin.
###Chapter 447: She Can Do Whatever She Wants

"What do you mean?"

"No wonder Mr. Roland seemed like a completely different person during that time. He was gloomy all day, and everyone in the company was too scared to speak loudly."

Stella recalled Penny mentioning how Adrian's office had practically become a forbidden zone back then. Even seasoned secretaries couldn't handle the pressure and resigned one after another.

"Now everything's fine. Your relationship is stable, and the kids are adorable." Editor-in-Chief Jessica teased with a smile. "Mr. Roland even supports your career—that's what a real man looks like. Unlike some men who feel threatened if their wives outshine them."

Stella pressed her lips together, smiling faintly.

Adrian had never interfered with her career. On the contrary, he always supported her quietly.

She remembered discussing this with him when they were younger. Back then, she worried she wouldn’t be able to manage a company well, and Adrian reassured her, "Just do your best. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll be here."

At that time, Adrian was barely in his twenties but already making waves in the business world. Meanwhile, she was still a spoiled princess who relied on him for everything.

She’d ask him for help with homework, poster designs, even English dictation. Looking back, she had been so willful.

"That smile is so sweet. What are you thinking about?"

Stella snapped out of her thoughts, cheeks warming. "Nothing."

"You're legally married. Why be shy?"

Legally married?

Stella lowered her gaze. Strictly speaking, they were divorced now—living together wasn’t even legal.

"By the way, where are the designs?"

Stella opened her phone gallery. "Here."

"Hand-drawn sketches?" Jessica sounded surprised. "Hardly anyone does that these days."

"Force of habit."

Jessica studied the designs closely. "The style is unique—not overly lavish, but full of charm. Like jewelry from an aristocratic young lady’s boudoir."

"Most oriental-inspired jewelry on the market is too ornate for daily wear," Stella explained. "I want to create pieces that embody Eastern aesthetics while being practical for everyday life."

"That makes sense." Jessica’s eyes lit up. "And with lower production costs, it’s perfect for Brilliant Star Group’s current situation."

Stella nodded. "I want jewelry to be accessible, not just an unattainable luxury."

They hit it off immediately and finalized the collaboration on the spot.

Before leaving, Jessica couldn’t resist asking, "With Mr. Roland’s resources, funding shouldn’t be an issue, right?"

Stella shook her head gently.

Adrian hadn’t offered, and she hadn’t asked. Both understood that money would only complicate things between them.

After wrapping up work at the office, Stella’s phone rang—it was Joy.

"Stella! Get downstairs now!"

"What’s going on?"

"There’s something you have to see! I’m outside your building—hurry!"

Stella rushed downstairs and barely settled into the car before Joy slammed the accelerator, making an illegal U-turn.

Unnoticed by them, two men exchanged resigned looks from a nearby car.

Adrian rubbed his temples. "Your girlfriend needs to retake her driving test. That illegal U-turn just cost her three points."

Julian sighed. "She’s draining my license dry with all these violations."

"When are you getting married?"

"Why don’t we make it a double wedding?"

Adrian’s smile faded.

Julian turned serious. "What’s really on your mind? It’s obvious Stella cares about you."

"She has unresolved feelings." Adrian gazed out the window. "I don’t know if what she feels for me is love or just familiarity."

"Does it matter, as long as you’re together?"

"I won’t force her again." Adrian’s voice was quiet but firm. "Let her do what she wants. I’ll be here, watching over her."

"And what about you?"

"It doesn’t matter." Adrian murmured, "As long as she’s happy."
###Chapter 448 If There Were a Choice

Julian Valois tapped the desk with his slender fingers, producing crisp sounds. "So you're just going to stay like this?"

Adrian Roland lowered his gaze, a bitter smile tugging at his lips. "This is fine. She has her world, and I'll keep to my place."

"Going back to being 'Mr. Alistair' again?"

"That was the closest I've ever been to happiness."

Julian couldn't help but laugh. "Two emotionally constipated people in a relationship—what a perfect match."

Adrian looked up. "Did Joy send you to stall me?"

Julian spread his hands. "Since you've seen through it, just play along. I can't stand women making a scene."

Adrian's eyes fell to his legs. "In this state, where could I even go?"

Julian's expression softened. "It takes time to heal broken bones. Consider it a forced vacation. Vincent is just a puppet on paper—the company's real power is still in your hands."

"Hmm."

"You've dealt with Lily, Victor, and Mr. Xavier. What about Vincent?"

Adrian was silent for a moment. "He's still Roland blood."

"Letting him go?"

"I'll think about it."

Stella Valentine nearly twisted her ankle when Joy Fairsprene yanked her into the car.

The red sports car sped down the highway as Stella clutched the seatbelt, her knuckles turning white.

"Joy, slow down!"

Joy ignored her, flooring the accelerator.

The scenery outside grew increasingly desolate until they stopped before a gray-white building.

"Where is this?"

Joy lowered her voice mysteriously. "Taking you to see something interesting."

Walking through the heavily guarded corridor, Stella suddenly realized where they were.

"Which cell is Lily in?" Joy stopped a guard.

"308. Hurry—you only have twenty minutes."

The door opened, revealing a room split in two by a cold glass partition.

Joy patted her shoulder. "Settle your debts. I'll wait outside."

As the door closed, Stella heard the violent pounding of her own heart.

Clang—

The sound of the iron door opening was especially jarring.

Lily Savigny shuffled in, ankle chains dragging, her orange prison uniform hanging loosely. She looked up and grinned when she saw Stella.

"Here for one last look?" Her voice was rough as sandpaper.

Stella studied the woman who had once been radiant. The purple dresses and flawless makeup were gone, replaced by hollow cheeks and bruised arms.

"Nothing to say?" Lily tilted her head. "Here to laugh at me?"

"I just wanted to see what kind of demon could destroy so many lives."

Lily burst into laughter, the sound echoing in the empty room. "Four lives for two—worth it!"

"Those were real people!"

"So what?" Lily pressed closer to the glass, madness gleaming in her eyes. "You know the funniest part? Adrian hated you to the core, yet he still became 'Mr. Alistair' to protect you. And me? I wasn't even good enough to be a stand-in."

Stella clenched her fists. "That child—"

"Ha!" Lily slammed her palm against the glass. "You actually believed that lie? Didn't Joy tell you? I've been infertile for years!"
###Chapter 449: The Cage of Milan

Stella's fingers tightened slightly.

Lily's laughter was shrill and piercing. "Men are such simple creatures. The car accident plan worked perfectly—you two really fell apart. I approached him as planned, but he wouldn't even touch me."

"I tried everything, even drugging him. Nothing worked."

"In the end, I had to use sleeping pills. The next day, I told him we'd slept together and that I was pregnant. And he actually believed me."

Stella's lashes trembled.

"The funny part? After learning about the baby, he grew even more distant. Did you think his kindness was love? It was just obligation."

"He only agreed to marry me for the child, and even then, it took my mother pressuring him for ages. It wasn’t until Martha died that he finally gave in."

Stella's breath hitched.

So all that coldness, that desperate rush to marry—it was all for a child that never existed?

"But he said he took you traveling the world..."

"Traveling the world?" Lily's smile twisted. "In his eyes, the entire world was just one city—Milan."

"Milan?"

"We were trapped there for a whole year. A dull little town, explored in a week, with terrible restaurants."

Milan...

Stella's mind flashed to the campus fountain.

That was where she had studied. At twenty, she'd abandoned her education to return home and marry, only to have her world turned upside down.

One more year, and she would have graduated under the name "Star," stepping into the jewelry design world with the glory of "Stellar Melody."

All her dreams had ended abruptly in that upheaval.

So his idea of traveling the world was staying in Milan for a year?

"He..."

Lily suddenly shrieked, "Why are you so lucky? I gave everything, and all I got was a death sentence!"

Stella replied calmly, "It's lethal injection now."

"How would you know?"

"Because I was almost the one executed."

Lily gritted her teeth. "If not for your pregnancy..."

"You and your mother schemed your whole lives," Stella cut in. "Schemed against me, against the Roland and Valentine families. But justice always finds a way."

"What are you saying?"

"You really think you could tamper with the car alone? Hide evidence for five years?"

Lily's face paled. "Someone used me?"

"He wanted the same thing you did, but he never got his hands dirty. Legally, he's innocent."

"That's not fair!" Lily shot to her feet. "He was the mastermind!"

"Where's the proof?"

Lily fell silent.

"To him, you were just a pathetic joke."

Lily slammed her fists against the glass. "Who was it? Tell me!"

Stella glanced at the clock. "Three minutes left."

Lily collapsed into the chair, her gaze vacant.

Stella stood, exhaling slowly. "My father, the Roland elders, Martha, my son... For years, I wanted to kill you with my own hands."

"But now, I just feel... peace."

"Crimes always come to light. These four years were stolen time."

She turned to leave.

"Stella!" Lily suddenly begged. "One last request."

"The child?"

"Could you...?"

"No." Stella's voice was final.

"You love children, don’t you? Just adopt another—"

Stella closed her eyes briefly, pushed open the door, and walked away without looking back.
###Chapter 450 Love and Hate

Joy Fairsprene paced anxiously outside the police station. When Stella Valentine emerged, she rushed forward. "That was quick! I thought you'd have a huge fight."

Stella remained calm. "Let's go."

"Already?" Joy's eyes widened. "Aren't you staying to watch her execution? After all the lives she ruined, she's getting off easy!"

Stella shook her head gently. "The law will deliver justice."

As Joy was pulled toward the car, she persisted. "Really not staying? I took time off just so you could witness this moment."

Stella extended her hand. "Give me the keys."

"What keys?"

"The car keys."

Joy blinked in surprise. "You can drive now? When did you learn?"

"Since you're so reluctant to leave, maybe I should go first."

Joy finally laughed and handed over the keys. "Fine, no watching. It's not like she can escape anyway."

Once inside the car, Joy kept stealing glances at Stella while buckling her seatbelt.

Stella pretended not to notice, closing her eyes to rest.

"Stella..."

"Hmm?"

"What did you say to Lily Savigny? I thought you'd tear into her."

"Hate." Stella opened her eyes. "She killed my father and Martha. How could I not hate her?"

"Then why are you so... composed?"

"Because hate changes nothing. She'll pay for her crimes, but the living must keep moving forward."

On the drive back, Joy drove more carefully than before. "Stella, do you still love Adrian Roland?"

Stella's lashes trembled slightly, but she didn't answer.

"You've changed these past six months," Joy hesitated. "You used to be strong, but you always relied on others for hope. Now... you stand on your own."

Stella murmured, "Everyone must learn to get back up."

"But isn't it lonely to shut out love completely?"

Stella turned to her. "Did Julian Valois put you up to this?"

"What? No—"

"Then it was Adrian."

Joy smacked the steering wheel in frustration. "I hate how you smart people see through everything! I just don't get why this counts as matchmaking!"

Stella chuckled. "Love and hate aren't black and white. Some things aren't about forgiveness... Never mind. Play a song."

"Which one?"

"Love and Hate."

The melancholic melody filled the car, a weathered female voice singing:

Love and hate entwined
Like shadows in the snow
How to piece together shattered dreams...

Joy listened thoughtfully to the lyrics.

When they parked outside Brilliant Star Group, Joy glanced around.

"Looking for something?" Stella asked.

"Nothing. Just checking parking spots."

Stella unbuckled her seatbelt. "Head back before rush hour."

"How will you get home tonight?"

"Taxi."

Joy suggested, "Get a driver's license. It's more convenient."

After a pause, Stella nodded. "Alright. I'll register tomorrow."

Joy brightened. "Really? That's great!"

Before exiting, Stella said meaningfully, "Tell Julian he doesn't need to hide. And... thank him for me."

Joy's eyes widened. "How did you—"

"With your driving skills, he'd never let you come alone." Stella smiled faintly. "Besides, Adrian's in the car too, isn't he?"
###Chapter 451: I Know You Know

The night was deep when Stella Valentine pushed open the heavy doors of the Roland family estate, exhaustion weighing on her shoulders.

Benjamin Langley hurried forward, pressing a finger to his lips. "The children are asleep."

Stella glanced at her watch. The hour hand pointed to ten.

"Have you eaten?" Benjamin whispered.

She shook her head. "I'll manage something quick."

"That won't do." He frowned. "There's food waiting in the kitchen."

Not wanting to wake the children, Stella hesitated. "It's fine, I—"

"No trouble at all." Benjamin smiled, cutting her off. "Everything's prepared. Just needs reheating."

Assuming the chef had left dinner for her, Stella nodded. "You should rest. I can handle it."

Benjamin yawned, his gaze flickering toward the study on the second floor where the light flickered intermittently. A knowing smile touched his lips. "Very well. Don't stay up too late."

In the kitchen, the refrigerator held neatly arranged dishes—crisp blanched greens, golden shrimp with corn, glazed ribs glistening red, and a clear winter melon soup.

Stella froze. The food looked freshly made, untouched.

The microwave hummed, filling the air with savory warmth. She devoured the meal quickly, then crept upstairs.

A sliver of warm light spilled from beneath the study door.

Adrian Roland sat in his wheelchair, a book open across his lap. Without looking up, he asked, "Did you eat?"

"Yes."

Silence thickened between them.

"The food tonight..." Stella broke the quiet. "It tasted different."

"Did it?"

"Not like before." She paused. "Almost... like how I make it."

Adrian turned a page. "As long as it suited you."

Her fingers tightened around her sleeve. "I'm going to shower."

The rush of water filled the bathroom, steam curling in the air. When she emerged, towel-drying her hair, the study was dark. Only a nightlight glowed in the bedroom, illuminating Adrian's still form turned away from her, his breathing even.

As she switched off the light, a sigh cut through the darkness.

"Did I wake you?"

"No."

"Have you been... sleeping poorly?"

"Dry your hair properly."

Stella frowned. "I did."

"Forgot your last cold already?"

"That was because you rode too fast—"

"The wind never bothered me."

"You've always had stronger immunity."

Adrian's voice softened unexpectedly. "Little Star... I can't dry it for you now."

Her fingers stilled. That nickname, that tone—it felt like another lifetime.

The hair dryer's drone filled the room, the scent of jasmine blooming in the dark.

"I saw Lily Savigny today," she said abruptly.

"I know."

"I know you know."

Adrian chuckled. "What do you want to ask?"

"Doesn't it... hurt you?"

"Should it?"

She bit her lip. "After everything..."

"If I'd known the truth sooner," his voice turned icy, "I wouldn't have spared her a glance."

Silence stretched between them.

"She said..." Stella gathered her courage. "That year in Milan."

"Hmm."

"Milan isn't that big..."

"I wanted to see where you'd lived." Adrian laughed bitterly. "Pathetic, isn't it? Hating you while trailing after your shadow like some obsessed stalker."

###Chapter 452 I Will Agree to Your Request.

The bedroom was so quiet they could hear each other's breathing.

The nightlight had gone out unnoticed. Not a single star shone through the window. Thick clouds blanketed the night sky, refusing to let even moonlight seep through.

Darkness sharpened their senses.

Stella Valentine could distinctly hear Adrian Roland's breathing, even feel the rise and fall of his chest. The realization made her pulse quicken.

In her memory, Adrian had always been that steady, reliable older brother figure. Even after they became lovers, he remained unflappable. But now, she clearly detected the rapid thud of his heartbeat.

"We..." She bit her lower lip. "We agreed to go back to how things were before. Let's just leave the unpleasantness behind."

"Yes," Adrian's voice was soft. "Back to before."

Stella suddenly asked, "Did you shower today?"

"I did."

"Was it Vincent or Benjamin who helped you?"

"I can manage on my own." He paused. "Benjamin just wheeled me to the bathroom."

Her gaze fell on his legs beneath the thin blanket. "Does it still hurt?"

"A little."

"Your arm?" She looked toward the pitch-black window. "The weather's changing."

Adrian flexed his left arm, surprised. "Actually, it barely hurts today."

"That's good."

In the darkness, his hand found the ends of her hair. Still warm from drying, the strands carried the scent of jasmine, soft against his fingers.

"Little Star..."

"There's something I need to tell you." Stella spoke first.

Adrian withdrew his hand with a quiet "Hmm?"

"Your injuries have mostly healed, and you're handling work fine. My company's been keeping me really busy lately, so..."

"Just say it." Adrian chuckled. "The Stella I knew never hesitated. You used to order me around like a queen."

The mention of their past made her cheeks burn.

She was three years younger than Adrian. During their school days, that gap felt like a chasm. She'd always seen him as an untouchable senior—until that afternoon he cornered her in an empty classroom, refusing to let her leave until she agreed to be his girlfriend.

After that, Adrian spoiled her rotten. He carried her backpack, tutored her homework, even delivered lunch to her classroom. The envious stares from other girls went to her head, and she began bossing him around with increasing boldness, especially in crowded places.

Adrian always played along with the "henpecked boyfriend" act perfectly—until her father grounded her for neglecting studies. But not even that stopped the determined teenager from climbing walls to see her. Those secret rendezvous became the most vivid memories of her youth.

Stella took a deep breath. "The estate is too far, and I don't drive. Commuting is difficult. I was thinking..."

She wanted to move out.

If they were going back to before, they might as well go all the way.

"I've been having strange issues with my designs lately," she chose her words carefully. "Finished drafts keep getting altered overnight. The changes are good, but they're obviously your style. The whole industry knows you're helping me. It's...not fair."

Adrian gave a soft laugh. "Understood. I won't touch your designs anymore."

The old Stella would've slammed the table by now. This cautiousness was his doing.

"I'm not blaming you," she hurried to explain. "I just want to try standing on my own. Things kept interrupting before. This time, I want to focus on building the company properly."

"Okay." Adrian considered for a moment. "I'll have Penny—"

"No need. I've already found a place."

His expression stiffened momentarily. "All arranged?"

"Jessica has a vacant apartment near my office. She's going through a divorce and could use the company."

"Is moving out necessary?" Adrian asked quietly.

"...Yes." Stella nodded hesitantly. "Is that alright?"

Adrian sighed. "When have I ever refused you anything?"

Relief washed over her.

"What about the children?" Adrian suddenly asked.
###Chapter 453: No Cilantro, Extra Crispy Soybeans

"I can do this." Stella Valentine's voice was resolute.

Adrian Roland frowned slightly. "You're taking all three children?"

She had agonized over this decision. Each child was a piece of her heart—leaving any behind would torment her. What was the point of moving out if she kept running back to the Roland estate?

"I raised all three alone overseas," she said firmly. "Besides, my mother will help. The Roland estate isn't her home—she'd feel out of place."

Adrian saw through her excuse but didn't call her out.

He understood. When they'd been consumed by hatred, things were simpler. Now with misunderstandings cleared, their tangled emotions left her floundering. Moving out was her escape from this messy love.

As a father, Adrian had no right to object. He'd only cared for Luna briefly as a baby—the rest of the time, he'd failed them. Forcing the children to stay while their mother left? Unthinkable.

After a long silence, he relented. "Where's Jessica's apartment? How's the security?"

"Skyline Garden. One stop from the office, 24-hour security." She recited the details like a mantra.

"Skyline Garden?" The name rang familiar.

Stella reminded him, "Below that Spicy Rice Noodles place I loved."

Adrian's eyes lit up. "No cilantro, extra crispy soybeans."

"...Yes."

"When are you moving?"

"This weekend."

"Next week." He compromised. "Give me one more weekend with them."

Stella knew when to yield. "Alright."

"I ordered a car arriving this weekend. Check it out."

She remembered his rainbow-hued sports car collection—all sold off for her sake. The garage must feel cavernous now.

"You're the car expert. If you approve, it's fine."

"Good performance, compact for female drivers. You'll like it."

Stella blinked. "For me?"

"Learn to drive. It'll help." Adrian paused. "With three kids—Ethan starting elementary school, Luna and Celeste in preschool—you can't rely on taxis. No child seats, too dangerous."

For the children, Stella gritted her teeth. "Fine."

"Don't worry. Driving's easy." His voice softened. "Like bumper cars, just follow traffic rules. I'll teach you."

She eyed his cast-encased leg and arm. "You?"

"I'll coach from the passenger seat. No limbs required."

Remembering Joy Fairsprene's reckless speeding, Stella chose Adrian without hesitation.

——

Weekend sunlight streamed through the trees.

Benjamin Langley took the children picnicking, thoughtfully inviting Grace Laurent. The trio buzzed with excitement, departing at dawn.

Stella sat white-knuckled behind the wheel.

"Turn the wheel hard...good, now reverse..." Adrian guided patiently.

She stepped out to find the rear tires over the line.

By noon, she still couldn't parallel park. Defeat weighed heavy.

"New car jitters. Try again," Adrian encouraged.

Second attempt: failure.
Third attempt: same result.

Rubbing his temples, Adrian suggested, "Maybe...don't move out? We have chauffeurs. Once my leg heals, I'll drive you."

Stella jutted her chin. "One more try."

By Saturday's end, she barely mastered parking. The thought of hill starts and perpendicular parking made her legs quiver.

That night, Adrian hobbled into the bedroom to find her collapsed on the mattress.

"Rest tomorrow?" he asked gently.

"No." She forced herself up, grabbing pajamas. "I'm fine."

Her phone lit up—"Jessica Blanchet" flashing onscreen.

Shower water cascaded in the bathroom.

After a hesitation, Adrian answered.

"Stella! Magazine sales skyrocketed tenfold! Your oriental jewelry trended! We're rolling in it! Hugo's jaw dropped! Career women rule! So...what did Mr. Roland say?"

"..."

"Hello?"

"I'm happy for her." His tone was warm.

A beat. "Mr. Roland?"

"Yes." Sincerity laced his words. "Jessica, thank you for looking after my Stella. If you ever need anything, just ask."
###Chapter 454: If the Mountain Won't Come to Me

The sound of running water in the bathroom stopped.

Stella Valentine stepped out, drying her damp hair. She noticed Adrian Roland was still awake, bathed in the soft glow of the bedside lamp as he intently read The Little Prince.

"Why that book all of a sudden?" she asked casually.

Adrian closed the book, fingertips brushing its gilded cover. "Business has been slow lately. Rare free time."

She turned to fetch the hairdryer when his voice stopped her. "The children are growing up. They shouldn't only hear fairy tales. I want to find stories with more depth."

Her movements stilled.

"They'll move to Skyline Garden with you tomorrow." His voice softened. "In my current condition... visiting them isn't convenient. I'll prepare more stories for when..."

He left the sentence unfinished, but Stella understood.

She knew this man too well. As a legendary negotiator in the business world, Adrian excelled at reading people. Years ago when teaching her negotiation tactics, he'd emphasized targeting what mattered most to the other party.

Now, he'd precisely struck her weakest spot—their children.

A rainy night four years ago flashed through her mind. That Adrian had used the same gentle tone to deliver the most piercing words. After all this time, he could still see through every defense she erected.

If the mountain won't come to me, then I must go to the mountain. The saying surfaced inexplicably in her thoughts.

The hairdryer's hum drowned out reflection. By the time she finished and lay down, Adrian had turned off the lamp, the book placed aside.

At dawn, Stella headed early to Skyline Garden. After cleaning the apartment with Editor-in-Chief Jessica Blanchet and stocking up on supplies, she prepared to return for the children at dusk. But Penny Anderson arrived first with the three kids and Benjamin Langley in tow.

Benjamin's eyes were red-rimmed as he held Ethan's hand, repeating, "Take good care of your sisters. Call Grandpa if anything happens..."

Penny approached quietly. "Mr. Roland said this SUV has child safety seats. Use it for now. We can switch if it's uncomfortable."

Stella nodded at the understated black vehicle.

"How's your driver's test going?"

"Passed the written exam. Road test and maneuvers are scheduled tomorrow."

Penny frowned. "Should I handle school runs this week?"

After consideration, Stella agreed. Tomorrow was Monday—the children couldn't miss school.

The Skyline Garden duplex, though smaller than a house, comfortably accommodated two adults and three children. Stella chose the upstairs bedroom, leaving the more convenient ground floor for Jessica.

When she descended after settling the kids, Jessica still sat hunched over her laptop, black-framed glasses reflecting screen light. Her teacup stood empty, fingers flying across the keyboard.

"These people can't even handle reprint procedures..." Rubbing her temples, Jessica drained the fresh tea Stella offered.

Stella sat opposite. "Trouble at work?"

"Magazine sales keep dropping. Advertisers are fleeing." Jessica suddenly smiled. "But working overtime feels good now."

"Had an epiphany?"

"Mm. Used to obsess over winning Hugo back. Focusing on work now, I realize..." She shrugged. "Divorce is oddly freeing."

Stella studied her teacup pensively.

Jessica leaned forward abruptly. "Why aren't you pushing Production to work overtime? That jewelry set is in high demand! Multiple celebrities have inquired."

"No rush." Stella sipped her tea.

"No rush?" Jessica's eyes widened. "This could revive Shi's Jewelry!"

"Influencer trends are fleeting." Stella set down her cup. "I'm building a legacy brand, not chasing viral fads. Strictly two hundred sets—no overproduction."

Jessica gasped in realization. "You want word-of-mouth prestige?"

"I want the Shi name remembered." Stella gazed at the darkening skyline, her resolute reflection superimposed on the glass.
###Chapter 455: Pure Luck

Stella Valentine's Oriental jewelry collection sparked a buying frenzy the moment it launched.

All two hundred limited-edition pieces sold out instantly. Countless disappointed customers lamented on social media. Scalpers quickly resold them at twenty times the original price, yet demand still outstripped supply.

Daily calls flooded in asking about restocks. The reputation of Shi's Jewelry soared overnight.

Seizing the momentum, Stella unveiled her second Oriental-inspired line. Unlike the first collection's minimalist elegance, this one featured vibrant "Four Noble Flowers" motifs, brilliantly capturing Eastern aesthetics.

At a time when Western jewelry favored exaggerated designs, her work stood apart. Each piece balanced artistry with wearability, ensuring the wearer became the center of attention.

To thank Editor Jessica Blanchet for her support, Stella innovated the sales model—tying purchase eligibility to magazine codes. Every issue carried an equal chance, guaranteeing fairness.

This sparked another frenzy. Magazine sales skyrocketed, with celebrities buying thousands of copies just for a chance. Jessica couldn't stop smiling, and Shi's Jewelry earned praise for its transparent system.

"No insider tricks, just pure luck" became the hottest topic.

Stella reserved several sets as gifts: the plum blossom design for Joy Fairsprene, the orchid for Penny Anderson, and bamboo for Jessica. The final chrysanthemum set was displayed in the company lobby as a signature masterpiece.

Within two weeks, the name "Star Designer" became renowned in jewelry circles. Everyone eagerly awaited her third collection.

"When's the next line coming?" Jessica pressed impatiently.

Stella, checking her son's homework, smiled. "Patience. I just got my driver's license and need to adjust to school runs. Luna and Celeste should start kindergarten soon—I have to arrange everything first."

......

Mornings in the children's room were always chaotic.

"Ethan, as the big brother, set an example," Stella said softly, drawing the curtains. Sunlight spilled over the three children's blankets.

Ethan scrambled up, dressed himself, then went to wake Luna. "Five more minutes," Luna mumbled into her pillow.

"Last time you said 'one more episode' and watched three," Ethan retorted mercilessly. Luna pouted but got up.

Meanwhile, Celeste clung to Stella's neck. "Mommy, I don’t want kindergarten. Can I stay home with you?"

"Little sleepyhead." Stella booped her nose and carried her to the bathroom. She was always gentler with her fragile youngest.

"But I want to play with Ethan and Luna!" Celeste puffed her cheeks like a pufferfish.

"Then you must go to school," Stella said, braiding her hair. "Otherwise, when they start elementary school, you'll still be in kindergarten and see them even less."

Luna immediately straightened up. "Mommy, I'll study hard!" She grabbed her toothbrush with newfound determination.

Watching them, Stella suddenly thought of Adrian Roland. Did he ever refuse to get up as a child? With his stubbornness, no one could’ve made him.

She shook her head, pushing the thought away. These hectic two weeks had left little room for memories of him.

Had his leg injury healed?

"Stella, breakfast is ready," Grace Laurent called, entering with two children. "Go eat—I'll handle them."

"It's fine, Mom. Almost done." Clutching a hair tie between her teeth, Stella struggled with Celeste's braids while squeezing toothpaste for Luna.

Ethan finished washing up and volunteered, "Grandma, help Mommy. I'll do Luna's hair. I watched Daddy do it—I know how."

"Adrian can style girls' hair?" Grace asked, surprised.
###Chapter 456: Genetic Traits

Luna bounced her pigtails, her voice sweet and proud. "Grandma Grace, look! Daddy tied these ribbons for me!"

Grace Laurent suppressed a chuckle at her granddaughter's lopsided hairstyle. "Since when did Adrian learn to do this?"

"He practiced for days!" Luna lifted her chin triumphantly.

Stella Valentine kept her eyes on her porridge, pretending not to hear.

Grace watched her daughter's evasive expression and sighed inwardly. After all these years of separation, the couple still seemed to dance around each other.

Since moving out, Adrian called daily, his words cautious and measured. His assistants, Penny and Vincent, practically wore their loyalty on their sleeves.

"Grandma, let me brush my sister's hair," Ethan suddenly offered.

Grace smiled. "Boys don't usually do that."

"Daddy's a boy," Ethan reasoned. "I can learn."

Warmth flooded Stella's chest at her son's determination. She clenched her fists silently. She could take care of this family—with or without Adrian.

After breakfast, she reached for the dishes, but Grace had already slipped on rubber gloves. "I'll handle these."

"Mom, since when did you become so domestic?" Stella blinked in surprise.

Water cascaded over the plates as Grace turned on the faucet. "Independence is necessary. Your father spoiled me—now I know relying on others is foolish."

Tears pricked Stella's eyes. She embraced her mother. "Just give me time. I'll make everything right."

"Mom, we're ready!" Ethan stood by the door, backpack secured, his sisters behind him.

Stella checked each child's appearance, repeating safety reminders until they reached Ethan's school. Only then did she remember the parent-teacher meeting.

"Do I look presentable?" She nervously smoothed her hair.

Ethan grinned. "You're the prettiest! My classmates say you look like a movie star."

"Where did you learn such flattery?"

"It's genetics." He shrugged. "Daddy says it's a family trait."

Stella laughed. "Your father was never this smooth."

"That's because he saves his sweet talk for you." Ethan tilted his head. "I've seen him kiss you goodnight when he thinks you're asleep."

Stella choked on air. "Y-you saw that?"

"When I got up to use the bathroom." His expression remained innocent. "Daddy said they're goodnight kisses and told me not to wake you."

Scarlet flooded Stella's cheeks. She fumbled with the car door. "G-go inside! You'll be late!"
###Chapter 457: Mr. Roland's Little Scheme

"Mommy, I saw you and Daddy hugging last night!" Ethan blinked his innocent large eyes. "On your bedroom balcony."

Stella Valentine nearly dropped her water glass.

She forced composure as she set the cup down, though the tips of her ears turned pink. "Ethan, sweetheart, we pretend we didn't see things like that, okay?"

The boy tilted his head thoughtfully before nodding with partial understanding.

Stella took her son's hand as they walked toward the teacher's office, her heels clicking rhythmically against the tiled floor. The homeroom teacher looked up from organizing lesson plans, her face brightening at their arrival.

"Ms. Valentine, you look even younger than at last semester's parent-teacher conference." The teacher greeted them warmly. "No wonder Ethan excels—he clearly inherited your wonderful genes."

Stella smiled politely while scanning the wall displaying outstanding students' photos. Ethan's beaming face stood out among them, his sunny grin subtly mirroring Adrian Roland's features.

"I actually wanted to discuss something important." The teacher produced an embossed invitation. "The National Youth Math Olympiad—our school only has one nomination slot."

Ethan's eyes instantly sparkled.

Stella accepted the gilded letter, fingertips tracing the raised font. The competition would be held in the capital, coinciding with her company's quarterly review.

"Mommy..." Ethan tugged her sleeve, voice brimming with hope.

The teacher added helpfully, "Three faculty members will accompany the students throughout the trip. All accommodations and meals are covered by the organizers."

Stella met her son's eager gaze, recalling Adrian's words from last night: "Stella, stop stretching yourself so thin."

"Of course you're going." She ruffled Ethan's hair. "Mommy's so proud of you."

As they left the school building, Ethan suddenly stopped. "Mommy, if you're too busy, I can—"

"Don't even think it." Stella crouched to his eye level. "Nothing matters more than you. Ever."

Ethan nodded vigorously before throwing his arms around her.

At the office building, the elevator was packed with employees rushing to clock in. Stella checked her watch—three minutes left.

"Coming through!" A familiar voice called from behind the crowd. Penny Anderson maneuvered through the throng with an armload of files, stopping beside Stella.

"Stella!" Penny grinned ear to ear. "Surprise! I'm your new secretary!"

Stella arched an eyebrow. "Does Adrian know?"

"Don't mention that penny-pincher!" Penny waved dramatically. "He even cuts budgets for afternoon tea. Your company's snack room has imported chocolates!"

Stella suppressed a laugh. She knew Adrian too well—this was clearly his roundabout way of placing a "spy" beside her.

"So," she feigned sternness, "you're here for the snacks?"

Penny winked. "Mostly conquered by your irresistible charm."

They shared a knowing smile. Warmth flooded Stella's chest—that man couldn't even show concern without scheming.
###Chapter 458: Overtime Pay Guaranteed

"Stella, my loyalty to you is as steadfast as the sun and moon!" Penny dodged the topic, clinging to Stella's arm with playful affection. Her transparent evasion only solidified Stella's suspicions.

The mountain of files on the desk screamed urgency. Stella chuckled softly and withdrew her hand. "Alright, I believe you. The company's just starting out—if you don't mind the workload, stay and help. Today won't be easy."

Years of training at Roland Group kicked in. Penny rolled up her sleeves. "Consider it done!" She snapped into focus, her efficiency so startling it accelerated Stella's own pace.

As the sun dipped low, Stella was deep in revising a proposal when a knock interrupted.

"Stella, it's time to pick up the kids," Penny reminded, peeking through the door.

Stella jerked her head up, checked the time, and scrambled for her bag. "Oh no!"

Her heels tapped a frantic rhythm down the hallway. Penny called after her, "What about these files?"

"Your problem now!" Stella had already reached the elevator. "The top one needs client confirmation. Overtime pay included."

She never skimped on employee benefits.

Penny mentally calculated the overtime rate, barely suppressing a cheer. But the descending elevator numbers gave her pause. "Maybe you should handle it tomorrow? I might botch the client call."

At Roland Group, she'd mostly done administrative work. Client relations were uncharted territory.

Stella's lips curved. "I trust you."

Penny might fail, but Adrian wouldn't.

Penny forced a laugh, realizing her act had been seen through.

"His kindness is noted." Stella pressed the elevator button. "Once the company stabilizes, you can go back."

Panic flashed across Penny's face. "Stella, I'm yours for life!"

Before this assignment, Adrian and Vincent had drilled her on severing ties with Roland Group. She'd hesitated then: "Stella's too sharp for this. Shouldn't Mr. Roland fire me first?"

Vincent had massaged his temples. "We're not in a soap opera."

Adrian, reviewing documents at his desk, had said without looking up, "She'll see through it."

"So what do I do?" Penny had panicked.

"Be yourself." Adrian's pen paused. "She won't reject you. Even if she rejects me, she won't jeopardize the company."

Now, as the elevator doors slid open, Stella's words mirrored his prediction exactly: "Relax, I won't take it out on you."

Penny exhaled. "Then the work—"

"Just like when you reported my whereabouts to him, consult him if you're unsure." Stella stepped inside, eyes glinting mischievously. "Tell him overtime pay is guaranteed."

Before the doors closed, she winked. "See you tomorrow."

Shaking her head with a wry smile, Penny returned to the office and dialed.

Adrian answered instantly. "What did she say?"

"Mr. Roland," Penny stifled a laugh, "Stella says you'll be paid overtime."
###Chapter 459: She's Still the Same

Adrian Roland glanced at his wristwatch, a tender smile flickering in his eyes. "She must have gone to pick up the kids by now?"

"Right, Stella just left." Penny Anderson, his secretary and confidante, was accustomed to handling these trivial matters for Stella. She discreetly studied Adrian's expression, noting how his stern demeanor always softened at the mention of Stella.

The double salary made the extra workload more than worth it—she even enjoyed it.

Adrian tapped the desk with his slender fingers, his tone laced with amusement. "So now I'm her personal firefighter?"

"Pretty much." Penny suppressed a laugh before adding, "But the projects Stella hands over to you are all high-profile clients. It means she trusts you the most."

The remark visibly pleased him. A low chuckle escaped his lips. "She's still as lazy as ever, banking on me never refusing her."

Ever since their school days, Stella had always tossed her toughest problems his way. Even after all these years, that little habit hadn't changed.

While swiftly scanning and emailing documents, Penny mustered the courage to tease him. "But you don’t mind, do you? The 'blame' from the lady boss is in a league of its own. The files are in your inbox now."

She was the only one in the company bold enough to joke with Adrian this way. Everyone knew the feared "Ice-faced CEO" was utterly defenseless when it came to his ex-wife.

A notification chimed. Adrian opened the email and skimmed through it, admiration flashing in his eyes. "This is her standard—this client is as good as secured. Tell her the proposal is flawless."

Penny's eyes sparkled mischievously. "Mr. Roland, wouldn’t it be better if you told Stella that yourself?"

As an outsider, she saw the lingering feelings between them clearer than anyone.

Adrian's gaze darkened briefly before he half-jokingly threatened, "Keep gossiping, and I’ll deduct your bonus."

Stella's grip on the steering wheel was still a bit unsteady, but she’d improved since first getting her license. After picking up Ethan from elementary school, she hurried to the kindergarten.

"Mommy!" Luna and Celeste rushed into her arms like excited little birds.

Stella kissed each of their foreheads apologetically. "Sorry I’m late."

Ethan checked his watch with mock seriousness. "Only six minutes." He blinked. "But if you buy us ice cream, we’ll forgive you."

The two girls immediately cheered in agreement. Stella couldn’t help but laugh as she settled them in and fastened their seatbelts. "One cone each—no bargaining."

"Yay! Mommy’s the best!" The car filled with laughter and chatter.

Watching their innocent, joyful faces in the rearview mirror, Stella suddenly found the traffic less frustrating. If only the adult world could be as simple as a child’s.

Luna and Celeste played finger games in the backseat, giggling like wind chimes as they poked and tickled each other.

"I win!" Celeste raised her tiny hand triumphantly.

Luna pouted. "This game isn’t fair! Let’s play house instead!"

Ethan, sitting protectively beside them, reached into his backpack for toys, every bit the responsible big brother.

Listening to their lively chatter, Stella’s lips curved upward. "Did you have fun at school today? Make any new friends?"

"I helped a classmate solve a problem!" Ethan puffed out his chest. "Just like you taught me."

"Good job." She turned to the girls. "What about you, Luna and Celeste?"

"We built a castle together!" Luna gestured excitedly.

Celeste suddenly remembered something. "Oh! Mommy, the teacher said there’s a fun game with parents this weekend!"

"Parents?" Stella froze.

At a red light, she quickly checked the kindergarten group chat. Amid a flood of "Received" replies, a cheerful announcement stood out:

"Dear parents, this weekend’s 'Happy Little Sprouts' family event is coming! Fun games to strengthen bonds, plus a mystery prize! Please join us! ❤️❤️"

The teacher’s playful message made Stella’s smile falter.
###Chapter 460 The Uncrossable Chasm

"Luna, Celeste, how about Grandma Grace and I take Ethan with you to the parent-child event?" Stella forced a cheerful tone.

Celeste immediately pouted. "Mommy, where's Daddy? Teacher said both parents should come." She counted on her fingers, "There's even a daddies' competition. Daddy would definitely win!"

"Yeah!" Luna's eyes sparkled like stars. "Daddy's the strongest superhero in the world!"

The children hadn't seen Adrian Roland in months. As the eldest, Ethan hid his longing well. But the twins wore their hearts on their sleeves, terrified their parents might never reconcile.

Stella had considered that very possibility, though she couldn't bring herself to tell them. Their hopeful gazes pierced her heart like needles.

"Daddy's leg injury hasn't fully healed," she explained softly. "When he can walk properly, we'll all go to the amusement park together, okay?"

Though Adrian no longer needed a wheelchair, he still relied on crutches. Participating in kindergarten athletic events remained impossible.

Ethan squeezed his sisters' hands. "I'll go with you. I promise to win every prize!"

The twins mumbled reluctant "okays," their drooping postures twisting Stella's heart.

Grandma Grace had dinner ready when they returned. Noticing the girls' gloom, she quietly learned the reason and sighed. "They just miss their father."

Stella smiled bitterly. Didn't she know?

But that emotional chasm between them seemed uncrossable.

Changing the subject, she took the tableware toward the dining room. "Wash your hands before eating!"

Grace spared her daughter further pain. After dinner, she volunteered for homework duty. "Go handle your work. I can manage elementary school assignments."

"Remember—one ice cream cone each. No more."

In her study, Stella immersed herself in work. Though she'd delegated some decisions to Penny Anderson, the company remained hers to steer.

Besides, she couldn't count on Adrian's assistance.

A sync notification popped up. Opening it, she froze at the meticulously revised documents—far beyond Penny's capabilities.

Those familiar editing marks belonged unmistakably to Adrian.

She silently checked off completed tasks and opened her inbox. Shockingly, the once-overflowing unread emails had been cleared.

As she reached for the history log, her phone vibrated.

That long-absent name on the screen stole her breath.

[All handled. Get some rest.]
###Chapter 461: The Secret of the Password

The tone and delivery of this text message instantly transported Stella back to the days of the rose garden.

In the Roland family villa, Adrian reclined in his office chair and let out a long sigh. Ever since helping Stella with her work, his heart had been unsettled. He worried she might be angry if she discovered he had accessed her email, and feared his efforts might not meet her expectations.

The last time he had felt this anxious was when he pursued her as a student. Now, with Ethan already in elementary school, he found himself reliving the nervousness of his youth.

His phone vibrated. Stella replied: How did you get into my email?

He didn’t answer immediately.

Minutes later, a string of numbers appeared: 08261231

It was a combination of their birthdays.

She had used it for years.

Later, when she considered changing the password, she discovered "Mr. Alistair" also shared the birthday of 1231, so she kept it.

Another message arrived: The password wasn’t compromised—even Penny doesn’t know it. If you’re worried, you can change it.

Stella’s mind flashed to the image of a younger Adrian—domineering yet shameless.

He had deleted every confession text sent to her by boys, scowling as he lectured her: "You’re too young to be dating!"

Caught red-handed, she shrank guiltily. "Adrian, I’m not dating anyone. They sent those messages on their own—I’m innocent!"

Back then, Adrian wore a white dress shirt, his tie loosened in frustration. He stared down at the girl who was blossoming into a beauty, radiant enough to make any boy restless.

"How did they get your number?"

"I don’t know..."

Seeing her pout, it was clear she had no interest in those boys. Adrian secretly relaxed but still inspected her phone thoroughly.

"I’ll let it slide this time." He returned the phone with a stern expression. "Stay away from them from now on."

"You’re the best, Adrian! I’ll focus on studying!"

"Ask me anytime if you don’t understand something."

He tapped on her phone. "I changed the password. Don’t lend your phone to anyone."

"What’s the new password?"

"08261231."

"0826 is my birthday. What’s 1231?"

Adrian nearly jumped in frustration. "Figure it out yourself!"

She hadn’t even known his birthday.

Eventually, he succeeded in bringing his little rabbit home. It wasn’t until high school that Stella finally realized, her cheeks flushing as she mumbled, "So you liked me that early..."

No longer pretending to be proper, Adrian kissed her triumphantly. "After we get married, we’ll use this for our bank account too. Each of us holds half—how romantic."

Time had passed, and now she could smile at those memories. Staring at the option to change her password, she hesitated.

Adrian was right. As a company executive, password security mattered. But what should the new one be? The kids’ birthdays weren’t secure enough, and every important date in her life was intertwined with Adrian.

In the end, she didn’t change it, returning instead to her design revisions. The company’s legal team wasn’t for show—if anything happened, the other party would be at fault.

Adrian waited at his computer for half an hour, each second dragging. When he logged out and back in, finding the old password still worked, he nearly laughed aloud.
###Chapter 462: Please

Joy faded into endless emptiness.

The password remained unchanged—perhaps just force of habit.

He once believed himself to be the one who knew her best. Now, that confidence lay shattered.

He didn’t even have the right to understand her anymore.

The smiling faces of Ethan and Luna surfaced in his mind, and the corners of his lips lifted slightly. After years navigating the ruthless tides of business, he never claimed to be a gentleman. But now, he wanted to be shameless—just this once.

To use their children to keep her.

A self-deprecating smile tugged at his lips as he leaned back in his chair, his gaze softening on the screen.

While working, he inexplicably opened her email history.

They were both sentimental. The email accounts from their student days were still in use, even for work correspondence.

Ever since she moved out of the villa, he had drowned himself in memories. Her diary lay by his pillow, and he couldn’t sleep without reading a few pages. By now, he had memorized every word, yet he still revisited it nightly.

The emails offered new solace. Their exchanges traced the arc of their love—from youthful innocence to burning passion, then to ruin.

He scrolled backward. The first one that caught his eye was her desperate plea for help.

"Are you there? Emergency! I haven’t finished tomorrow’s assignment—please send answers! I promise I’ll do it myself next time!"

Just a few lines, but her panic from back then leaped off the screen.

His lips curved unconsciously. He clicked on his reply—the attachment had expired, but it reminded him of that frantic afternoon. To spare her from reprimand, he’d spent three hours scanning the test papers.

Later, they grew wiser. Doing homework together was more efficient—and gave them an excuse to stay close.

The next email was her whining for late-night snacks.

"Mom and Dad keep saying street food is dirty, but it’s so good! Bring me grilled squid when you pick me up tonight—the stall by the park entrance, extra sauce! Love you~"

During their honeymoon phase, the emails were endless. Dozens in a single night. Who would’ve thought two top students would treat email like texting, their combined word count surpassing any essay?

His fingertips brushed the screen, as if he could reach through time and touch her younger self.

Happiness was always fleeting. Further down, the emails grew sparse. Misunderstandings piled up, and distance seeped into every word.

He opened his own inbox to compare, then froze—remembering the foolish thing he’d done.

In the arrogance of youth, he’d deleted every email connected to her, believing it would erase the memories.

"Turns out I was even stupider back then," he muttered, closing the tab with a bitter smile.

His inbox was packed, expanded twice yet still constantly full. But in that ocean of data, her traces had vanished.

At least fate granted him this chance to reread her old messages. He took a deep breath and opened her final emails.

"Adrian, please reply. Your phone’s off—just give me one chance to explain."

"It’s really important. Come home. If you don’t, I’ll keep waiting."

"I never thought we’d end like this. Even if it’s over, tell me to my face."

She’d sent countless emails, even read receipts. But he never knew—he’d deleted every one unread.

Blinded by rage, he missed her final, desperate message. Just three words:

"Please."
###Chapter 463: Family Day

Morning light filtered through the curtains as Stella Valentine stood before her closet selecting an outfit. She chose a soft blue sundress—casual yet polished.

"Mommy!" Luna Roland burst in clutching a hair accessory box, her little face scrunched in distress. "I can't decide between the bunny and strawberry clips!"

Stella knelt, smoothing her daughter's silky hair. "Sweetheart, we can wear one on each side. That way both friends can come with you."

Celeste Roland dashed in barefoot, waving a storybook. "Mommy, I want this princess hairstyle!"

"Of course." Stella took the book, her fingers weaving deftly through Celeste's hair. The mirror reflected their matching smiles.

Ethan Valentine stood by the door adjusting his backpack. He carefully arranged his sisters' water bottles and counted their snacks.

"Mom, I packed band-aids and wet wipes." His serious expression mirrored an adult's responsibility.

Warmth flooded Stella's chest as she ruffled his hair. "You're amazing, Ethan. My dependable little man."

Grace Laurent entered with breakfast, admiring the children's excitement. "My darlings look absolutely radiant today!"

"Grandma!" The girls nearly toppled her milk glass in their enthusiastic hug.

Stella rescued the tray. "Mom, you should rest. Let me handle this."

Grace waved her off. "Nonsense. Are you sure you can manage all three alone? I could come—"

"They're perfect angels." Stella distributed plates with practiced ease.

At the doorway, Grace called after them. "Take lots of pictures!"

"We will!" Three voices chorused back.

Colorful banners fluttered outside the kindergarten to cheerful music. Celeste tugged Stella's hand. "Look, Mommy! Balloons!"

Luna pointed at the rainbow archway. "It's like a fairy tale castle!"

At the check-in table, a young teacher beamed. "Welcome to Family Day!"

She handed them a vibrant card. "This is your activity passport with a map. Earn stamps and prizes at each station!"

As Stella thanked her, the teacher glanced around. "Is Dad parking the car? Some games require both parents."

The air stilled. Celeste fidgeted with her skirt hem. Luna's eyes grew shiny.

Ethan stepped forward. "I'll be the dad! I'm tall enough."

The teacher gave Stella an apologetic look. "Certain activities do need an adult male participant..."

Stella squeezed their small hands, her voice steady. "We'll enjoy the other wonderful games together."

Kneeling to their level, she met each child's gaze. "What matters most is our special day as a family, right?"

Ethan nodded fiercely, distributing candy from his backpack. "We'll collect every stamp we can!"

Watching their renewed excitement, Stella's heart ached and swelled simultaneously. She inhaled deeply, clasping their hands.

"Adventure awaits!"
###Chapter 464: A Lone Tree Can't Form a Forest

The sun shone brightly on Family Day at the kindergarten, with colorful flags fluttering in the breeze. Every game designed by the school required participation from both parents.

Stella Valentine stood at the entrance, her fingers tightening slightly as the teacher explained the activities. She looked down at the three pairs of eager eyes and forced a smile. "Thank you, we'll just join the simpler games."

"Participation is what matters," the teacher reassured her, glancing at the empty space behind Stella.

Laughter and cheers filled the air. Stella held Ethan's hand while Luna and Celeste clung to her sleeves. Her gaze swept across the playground, lingering briefly on a hopscotch game that required parents to lift their child together before she quickly looked away.

"Mommy!" Celeste suddenly pointed toward the sandpit. "Can we play that one?"

A treasure hunt sign stood by the sandpit. The PE teacher greeted them warmly. "This game needs two adults to—" His eyes searched behind Stella. "Where's their father?"

"I can manage alone," Stella said firmly.

Once the game started, she realized her mistake. The obstacle course was designed to be tricky, and the bucket of marbles in her mouth wobbled precariously. Halfway through, the marbles spilled across the ground.

"Go, Mommy!" The children's voices cheered from below.

Stella clenched her jaw, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. By the time she finished, her shirt was soaked through.

"It's okay," she said, accepting the handkerchiefs the children offered. "Let's go get some snacks."

Under the shade of a tree, Stella handed out cupcakes. Nearby, excited shouts from the basketball court caught their attention. A little girl in a frilly dress was effortlessly lifted by her parents to score a basket.

"That's Lily," Luna whispered. "Her daddy picks her up every week."

Stella's throat tightened. Seeing the longing in her children's eyes, she stood abruptly. "Let's go play!"

"No, Mommy," Celeste shook her head. "You're already tired."

As the awkward silence stretched, a basketball rolled to their feet. A boy named Daniel chased after it, stopping short when he saw them. "Huh? You don't have a dad?"

Ethan immediately stepped in front of his sisters. "Our dad is hurt!"

"Liar!" Daniel pointed to the court. "My dad came even with a broken arm! Your dad just doesn't love you!"

Luna's eyes welled up instantly. Stella pulled her children close, her nails digging into her palms.
###Chapter 465: Come at Me Instead

Stella Valentine was adjusting Luna's hair bow when a shrill taunt pierced the air.

"Look! Those are the kids without a dad!"

Her head snapped up. A stocky boy stood by the basketball court, pointing and laughing at Luna and Celeste. His parents flanked him—a man with a cast on his right arm, and a woman stamping their son's activity card.

Celeste bristled like an angry kitten. "That's not true! Our daddy loves us!"

The boy stuck out his tongue. "Nah-nah! At least I have both parents here. You're just unwanted!"

Stella's chest constricted. Luna's eyes welled up instantly, fat tears rolling down her cheeks.

"Don't cry, sweetheart." Stella knelt to wipe her daughter's face, fingers trembling. Bringing them to this family event had been a mistake.

Celeste's face flushed crimson. "Take it back!"

"Make me!" The boy hurled a basketball at her.

The ball grazed Celeste's sleeve. She retaliated by throwing it back.

Before Stella could intervene, Ethan lunged forward. Known for his calm demeanor at school, he now gripped the boy's collar with uncharacteristic fury.

"Let go of my son!" The mother shrieked, charging toward them.

Chaos erupted. The father, despite his injured arm, bellowed: "Wild brats with no upbringing!"

Stella shielded her children, voice quivering. "We'll apologize if your son does the same."

"Dream on!" The woman pointed at a scratch on her son's cheek. "My boy's Harvard material! You think you can afford to ruin his face?"

Celeste peeked out. "It's not like he was cute to begin with—"

"Celeste!" Stella clamped a hand over her mouth.

The woman exploded. "Ten thousand! Pay up or make your brats kneel in apology!"

The father eyed Stella's lone-parent status with disdain. "Just a housewife, huh? Bet your husband doesn't know you're wasting his money."

Her nails dug into her palms. Then a tall figure stepped between them and the hostile family.

The man's voice cut through the tension like ice. "If you have a problem," he said, "come at me instead."
###Chapter 466: Feeling Better Now?

"Uncle Vincent!" Ethan's eyes lit up as he bounded over like an excited fawn.

Luna and Celeste immediately swarmed around him, tiny hands clutching at Vincent's jacket hem. "They were mean to Mommy!" they piped in unison, their voices sweet with childish indignation.

Stella's pupils contracted slightly at the sight. "Vincent?"

Understanding dawned quickly.

This was Adrian's doing.

Vincent rubbed his nose awkwardly. "Mr. Roland was concerned you might need backup."

His gaze sharpened as he turned to the aggressive couple. "I'm the executive assistant to the CEO of New Frontier Group, authorized to handle this matter."

Mrs. Richter took an involuntary step back under his piercing stare but quickly puffed her chest. "Either apologize or pay up!"

"Ten thousand dollars," Mr. Richter added, greed flickering in his eyes.

Vincent smirked, pulling a checkbook from his inner pocket. The pen scratched decisively across paper. "Here."

The Richters froze.

They hadn't expected such immediate compliance.

"This..." Mrs. Richter's fingers trembled slightly around the check.

Vincent looked down at them. "Let's not have a repeat performance."

His quiet tone carried unshakable authority.

Stella gathered the children close. "They want to play the shooting game."

Vincent hesitated. "Madam, I'm not sure—"

"For their sake," she murmured. "I won't have them whispered about."

Seeing the kids' hopeful faces, Vincent relented. "Very well."

On the court, Ethan moved like a nimble monkey, sinking shot after shot with Stella and Vincent's help.

"Perfect score!" The teacher announced in surprise. "Current first place!"

Luna and Celeste clapped gleefully. "Ethan's amazing!"

Stella knelt to their level. "Having fun now?"

Celeste suddenly stuck her tongue out toward Daniel. "Crybaby tattletale!"

Daniel's face flushed crimson.

Ethan swiftly shoved a milk carton into his sister's hands. "Drink."

Obediently clamping her lips around the straw, Celeste continued blinking triumphantly.
###Chapter 467 If It Were Him

The game session ended with the three children dominating through teamwork. Ethan's leadership, Luna's keen observation, and Celeste's cheerful energy helped them break multiple records. The podium was nearly swept clean by their victories.

"These kids are truly impressive," a young female teacher remarked while organizing the prizes. "Thank goodness their father arrived in time."

Vincent nearly snapped his neck shaking his head. "Misunderstanding—I'm Mr. Roland's assistant. Just here for work today."

"Oh?" The teacher flushed with embarrassment. "My apologies, I'm still new..."

Stella quickly smoothed things over. "No worries. Kids, say goodbye to your teacher."

The trio obediently bid farewell, diffusing the awkward moment. In the parking lot, the trunk overflowed with their haul as the children cheered excitedly.

"Let Uncle Vincent organize everything first," Stella said gently. "You can play with them at home."

Ethan opened the car door, instinctively letting his sisters enter first. Luna suddenly tugged Vincent's sleeve. "Uncle, can I have that Ultraman?"

Surprised, he handed it over. After thanking him, Luna clutched the toy and dashed back toward the kindergarten.

Stella hurried after her, with Ethan and Celeste close behind. Vincent stayed behind to finish packing.

Luna intercepted Daniel at the entrance. The boy stood empty-handed, scowling. "Here to gloat?"

"I came to make up," Luna said, holding out the Ultraman. "Mom says it's normal for kids to argue, but we should always make peace."

From a distance, Stella nodded approvingly at Ethan and Celeste. "Learn from your sister."

Daniel froze, scratching his head in confusion. Luna stepped closer. "Hitting wasn't right. This is for you. Let's be friends."

The boy took the toy, silent. Luna's eyes curved like crescents. "Accepting means we're okay now! My dad's as strong as Ultraman—I'll introduce you someday."

Returning to her family, Luna took Stella's hand. "Mom, let's go home."

"Well done." Stella lightly pinched her daughter's cheek.

Celeste pouted. "Why give him your toy?"

"Mom says kindness wins people over," Luna declared seriously. "Daniel's the strongest in class. We can't beat him."

"But you have Mom and Uncle Vincent!" Celeste argued.

Ethan spoke up. "We have school. Adults have work. Making peace is smartest."

Vincent gaped. "Madam, did you teach them this?"

"They figured it out themselves." Pride glimmered in Stella's eyes. The earlier conflict with Daniel's parents had made her consider transferring schools—now she felt at ease.

Vincent marveled. "Mr. Roland always says Luna's the most innocent. Never realized how wise she is."

Celeste nodded obediently while Ethan pulled strawberry milk from his backpack. "Drink this before we leave."

Watching their sweet interactions, Stella's lips lifted unconsciously.

Then, for a fleeting moment, Adrian's image surfaced in her mind.

If it were him here—what would he do?

At twenty-three, Adrian would've thrown punches without hesitation.

At twenty-eight, he might've coldly asked, "Still want to stay in Houston?"

And now...
###Chapter 468: I Wish She Were More Vulnerable

Memories blurred like watercolor paintings soaked in rain. Stella Valentine struggled to piece together the complete picture, but only vague color blocks remained.

The once sharp-edged man had been smoothed by time.

The last time she saw him was the day she moved out of the Roland mansion. Penny Anderson was busy loading luggage into the car while the children sat obediently inside. For some reason, Stella suddenly turned to look at the second floor.

Behind the floor-to-ceiling window, a figure hastily retreated behind the curtains.

But the cane left visible silently declared—he was no longer the proud and ambitious Adrian Roland of the past.

"Miss Stella, shall I take you back to the Roland residence?" Vincent Astor's voice pulled her back to reality. "The old house has plenty of empty rooms..."

"No need," she interrupted. "My mother is waiting at home to help."

Vincent took the hint and bid farewell, turning to report back to Adrian.

In the study, Adrian set down a document, listening intently as Vincent recounted the kindergarten incident. When he heard the children had been bullied, his grip on the cane tightened abruptly.

"Contact the principal," his voice strained.

Vincent quickly stopped him. "It's already resolved. We just used your $10,000 check..."

"Reimburse it from my personal account." Adrian's knuckles whitened before slowly relaxing. "How is... little Stella?"

"Mrs. Roland handled it perfectly."

Adrian's lips twitched. "I wish she hadn't handled it so perfectly."

He remembered the Stella who used to whine and act spoiled around him, like a feisty little kitten. Now, she had become a self-reliant mother.

"Luna gave her Ultraman to the child who bullied her," Vincent suddenly added.

Adrian froze. His youngest daughter, who always hid in his arms begging to be carried, had learned to repay cruelty with kindness?

"Celeste was even more impressive," Vincent chuckled. "That child didn't even blink while putting the bully in his place."

A phone vibrated. In the photo Vincent sent, three children held hands, with Ethan standing tall in the middle like a slender poplar.

Adrian's fingertips lightly traced the screen. They would grow into better people than he ever was.

The thought filled him with both warmth and sorrow.
###Chapter 469: Just Seeing Her Shadow Is Enough

Adrian Roland's fingers trembled slightly as his phone screen lit up.

The photo showed Stella Valentine crouching to tie Ethan's shoelaces. Sunlight filtered through leaves, dancing along her hair with a soft golden glow.

"Mr. Roland, this was taken at last week's kindergarten family event," Vincent Astor leaned in, pointing at the screen. "Mrs. Valentine played tag with the kids. They were having so much fun."

Adrian zoomed in and out three times before saving the image.

"I don't deserve to be their father."

Vincent scratched his head. "You shouldn't say that. Most wealthy fathers don't care half as much as—"

"Care?" Adrian's lips twisted bitterly. "I can't even have dinner with them."

His thumb hovered over her contact countless times, always retreating before dialing. Afraid of hearing exhaustion in her voice. More afraid of polite small talk.

"Mrs. Valentine's been glowing lately," Vincent suddenly whispered. "Yesterday she baked cookies for the kids. The whole floor smelled like vanilla."

Adrian's throat moved. "She..."

"Oh!" Vincent slapped his thigh. "One parent asked if I was the dad! I immediately—"

The office temperature plummeted.

Vincent belatedly covered his mouth. "She only touched my wrist! And I corrected them right away!"

Adrian slowly twirled his pen.

"Look at this instead!" Vincent hastily pulled up a tablet. "Shi's Jewelry's new emerald collection sold out instantly. At the launch event, Mrs. Valentine—"

The pen clattered onto documents.

Vincent gulped. "Should I request a transfer to the South Africa branch?"

"Unnecessary." Adrian pushed away the personnel transfer form. "Send the new project manager."

His thumb absently traced the phone's edge. The lockscreen showed Stella's silhouette bending to retrieve a kite.

Vincent sighed. "Mr. Roland, you clearly—"

"Vincent." Adrian cut him off. "Know what's most pathetic?"

Floor-to-ceiling windows reflected his red-rimmed eyes.

"I don't even have the right to be jealous."

The filing cabinet's glass mirrored his slumped shoulders. The ruthless negotiator now looked like a lost child.

"When Mrs. Valentine saw your photo—"

"She looked at my photo?" Adrian's head snapped up.

Vincent nodded. "Last week while organizing albums. She stared at that picture of you with the kids for a long time."

Ink bloomed where the pen tip pressed into paper.

"She..." Adrian's voice cracked. "What did she say?"

"Nothing." Vincent softened his tone. "But when Luna said she missed you, Mrs. Valentine's eyes turned red."

Adrian abruptly stood and walked to the window.

From the 23rd floor, Shi Corporation's glass facade glowed gold in the sunset.

"Ever been in love?" he asked suddenly.

Vincent blinked. "In college—"

"Real love," Adrian pressed a hand to his aching chest, "is something you'd work yourself to death for and still remember."

He'd tried drowning in work. Yet at 3 AM, his computer screen always morphed into her smile.

"Sometimes I think..." Adrian gave a bitter laugh. "Just watching from afar is enough."

At least she still existed in his world.
###Chapter 470 Maybe a Lifetime Like This Isn't So Bad

The rift between Adrian and Stella was far more complicated than Vincent's petty relationship squabbles. Years of accumulated misunderstandings had formed an impassable chasm.

Vincent looked bewildered. "Mr. Roland, what do you plan to do? You can't keep dragging this out. I'm afraid—"

"I don't know." Adrian's voice was rough, like sandpaper. The memory of Stella walking away that day sent a dull ache through his chest. "Unless she says she's ready to accept me, I won't push her. This...is fine for now."

At least he could still watch her from afar.

Meanwhile, the Valentine residence glowed with warm light. Stella had just finished dinner with Grace and the children, sorting through today's carnival prizes in the living room.

"The plush toys go on your beds, and the model goes on Ethan's bookshelf, okay?" She crouched to meet the children's eyes.

Celeste studied the building blocks before tugging Stella's sleeve. "Mommy, can I trade my elephant for Ethan's blocks?"

"Here." Ethan handed them over without hesitation. "Dad already got me better ones anyway."

Stella's smile froze. She thought she'd built an impenetrable wall, but traces of him still seeped through the cracks.

Grace gave her shoulder a gentle pat. "Go work. I've got the kids."

Stella fled to the study. The computer screen flickered to life, but she stared blankly at spreadsheets until Penny's call snapped her out of it.

"Stella!" Penny's voice bubbled with excitement. "The operations team pulled an all-nighter—the numbers are incredible!"

A genuine smile finally surfaced. Reviving Shi's Jewelry had demanded every ounce of her strength. Endless coffee cups and sleepless nights had dragged the company back from bankruptcy's edge.

"That major client you personally handled—" Penny's voice shook. "We got it!"

"Really?!" Stella shot up, nearly knocking over the monitor. Her hands trembled as she opened her inbox. "Send me the details now!"

This project was her long-game masterstroke. Securing it would open the affordable luxury jewelry market, propelling Shi's back to industry dominance.

The client's email contained frustratingly sparse requirements: matching rings, interconnected heart design concept. Nothing else.

"These specs..." Stella massaged her temples. "Clearly targeting couples."

Her analysis crystallized: urban professionals, minimalist yet distinctive, suitable for daily wear...

This customer profiling method was something Adrian had taught her.

Stella slammed the laptop shut.
###Chapter 471: The Weight of Longing

The aroma of coffee filled the study. Stella Valentine rubbed her sore wrist. The final flourish on the wedding ring design glowed on her computer screen. She clicked save, then opened the quarterly financial report.

Outside, the night was ink-black. Only the study light remained on. Tomorrow was the group meeting—every figure had to be perfect.

A knock shattered the silence.

"Stella, still awake?" Grace Laurent's voice floated through the door.

"Come in, Mom." Stella didn't look up from her spreadsheets.

Grace entered with a steaming glass of milk. Seeing the empty coffee cup, she frowned. "Coffee hurts your stomach. Drink this instead."

"Thanks." The warmth seeped into Stella's fingers, easing her tension. Just then, the report loaded—a beautiful upward curve.

Grace peered over her shoulder. Her voice cracked. "These numbers... just like when your father started the company."

Stella looked up to see her mother wiping tears. The milk's steam blurred her own vision. Her throat tightened.

"I told you I could do it," she said lightly.

Grace turned, eyes red. "All those people said you shouldn't take over... Let them choke on their words now."

Stella set down the glass and grasped her mother's trembling hand. "Dad's watching. He'd be proud."

"Silly girl." Grace cupped Stella's gaunt face. "You've always been our pride—with or without the company. Look how thin you've gotten."

"I inherited your good genes." Stella winked.

Grace sighed. "I just worry. It's late—you should rest."

"Almost done." Stella gestured to the screen. "This project is crucial."

"If only I could help..." Guilt laced Grace's voice.

Pattering feet interrupted them.

Luna Roland burst in clutching a doll, tear-streaks on her cheeks. "Mommy! I had a bad dream!"

Stella opened her arms. "I'm here, sweetheart."

"A monster... in my dream..." Luna hiccuped.

Grace smoothed her granddaughter's hair. "Let Grandma tuck you in. Preschool tomorrow."

Luna suddenly went still, tiny fists gripping Stella's sleeve.

"What is it?" Stella whispered.

The child looked up, eyes glistening. "Mommy... I miss Daddy. Could Daddy beat the monster?"

The words struck like a dull blade. Stella held her tighter, the weight in her chest crushing.
###Chapter 472: The Intimacy and Distance Between Husband and Wife

Stella Valentine's heart melted at the sight of her daughter's tear-filled eyes. Luna clung to her doll, her little face flushed from crying. "Mommy, I'm scared..."

She knelt down and gently wiped the tears from Luna's cheeks. "Don't be afraid, sweetheart. How about Mommy sends you and Ethan to stay with Daddy for a few days tomorrow? He'll protect you."

"Really?" Luna sniffled. "Will you come too?"

Stella froze.

"If Mommy doesn't go, I won't go either." Luna suddenly wrapped her arms around Stella's neck. "I want to stay with you."

Grace Laurent sighed from the sidelines. "This child knows exactly how to tug at heartstrings."

"Grandma!" Luna pouted in protest. "I really am scared. And..." She leaned in to whisper in Stella's ear, "Mommy hasn't smiled lately. I want Daddy to make you happy again."

Stella didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Who taught you that?"

"Ethan said it's called 'putting on a brave face.'" Luna lifted her chin proudly. "Like the fairy in the storybook."

Grace chuckled. "This one's too clever for her own good."

"So will you promise, Mommy?" Luna held out her pinky finger. "Pinky swear! A hundred years, no take-backs!"

Stella gazed into her daughter's hopeful eyes and finally hooked her own finger around the tiny one. "Alright, I'll go with you. But you have to behave at school tomorrow. We'll visit Daddy after you're done."

Luna cheered and ran off, her earlier fear completely forgotten.

Grace watched her daughter with concern. "Stella..."

"Mom, I'm fine." Stella forced a smile. "What about you? Want to come along?"

"I've already made plans to travel with some old friends." Grace patted her hand. "It'll be good for you four to have some family time."

Stella's eyes grew warm. Her mother always put her first.

"Come, let me tell you a story." Grace led her to sit down. "About your father when he was young."

"Dad?" Stella was surprised.

"You only know him as the devoted husband, but he had a sweetheart before me." Grace's eyes grew distant with memory. "A girl with the surname Wen."

Stella's eyes widened. "He never mentioned her."

"Why would he?" Grace countered. "The intimacy and distance between husband and wife—some truths only cause pain. He kept it from me because he knew I'd overthink it."

Stella fell silent, thoughtful.

"When I found out, I made quite a scene." Grace laughed. "But look at us—we still loved each other for a lifetime."

"Mom..." Stella's voice trembled.

Grace took her daughter's hands. "Stella, I just need to ask you one thing. Does Adrian still love you?"
###Chapter 473: Dry Weather, Watch Your Temper

Stella Valentine lifted her gaze.

She nodded slowly.

"You know better than anyone how much he loves you."

"Mom..."

"I understand." Grace Laurent stroked her daughter's hair. "I know the barriers in your heart."

Stella buried her face in her mother's warm embrace. "It's not about forgiveness. I just don't know how to face him. We've both changed. There's too much unresolved between us—even being together feels like walking on eggshells."

"But you helped bathe him earlier?"

"That was..."

"Why?"

"He got hurt protecting me. I couldn't abandon him."

Grace's fingers combed through Stella's long hair. "I only want your happiness."

"..."

"Let the past stay in the past. You're still young. If you still love each other, why torture yourself?"

Stella pressed deeper into her mother's arms.

"Go to bed now."

She mumbled an agreement.

Warm light spilled through the study door onto the hallway.

Two small figures crouched by the corner eavesdropping. Celeste nearly jumped with excitement upon hearing they'd see their father tomorrow. "Yay!"

Ethan hastily covered her mouth.

The lights flicked on.

The siblings flushed, caught red-handed.

"We came to check on Luna," Ethan fidgeted with his fingers.

"Big sister had a nightmare and ran out," Celeste stuck out her tongue, hiding behind her brother.

Grace set Luna down. "Take your sisters to bed."

Ethan's eyes sparkled as he looked at Stella. "Mom, can we wake up early tomorrow? Visit Dad before school?"

Three pairs of hopeful eyes left her no room for refusal.

"Fine. But if anyone sleeps in..." She made tickling motions.

The children shrieked and scattered.

Silence reclaimed the study.

Stella gazed at the empty hallway, her smile fading. She always felt she wasn't doing enough.

At dawn, all three children miraculously woke early.

Stella took a cab to the Roland estate. Benjamin Langley rushed out in delight the moment she stepped out. "Madame is home!"

His shout echoed through the mansion.

In the study, Vincent Astor waited for Adrian Roland to sign documents. Both men turned toward the window.

Stella stood in the courtyard, the children chattering around her.

Vincent glanced at his boss's frozen stare and teased, "Not going down?"

"Unnecessary." Adrian's refusal contradicted his locked gaze.

As Benjamin ushered the family inside, Vincent suddenly gasped. "Madame, watch out!"

Adrian shot up. "What happened?!"

Everyone below looked up.

He abandoned his cane, stumbling to the staircase—only to find Stella perfectly unharmed.

Their eyes met. Both froze.

Vincent's mutter floated from behind. "Dry weather, watch your temper..."

Stella frowned in confusion.

Adrian turned to glare—but Vincent had already slipped downstairs. "Madame, let me brew some throat-soothing tea!"
###Chapter 474: Within Reach

Stella Valentine was adjusting the children's collars when Vincent suddenly announced, "I'll make tea," and vanished in an instant.

Adrian Roland's figure flickered past the second-floor railing.

She averted her gaze and turned to Benjamin. "The kids have been begging to see Grandpa Benjamin. Today, they finally got their wish."

Benjamin's eyes crinkled with laughter. "What's so special about this old man? But young master..." He lowered his voice. "He often smokes alone on the balcony in the middle of the night."

Stella's fingers twitched.

When she looked up again, the second floor was empty.

"Still struggling with sleep?" She feigned nonchalance. "No matter how busy work gets, he should rest."

The words died on her lips. Some concerns crossed boundaries if voiced too often.

"Young master claims insomnia," Benjamin sighed, then brightened. "I heard Shi's Jewelry is doing well lately?"

At the mention of the company, Stella relaxed slightly. "Just starting to recover. But it'll keep improving."

"Wonderful, wonderful." Benjamin's wrinkles deepened with his smile. "This warms my heart more than honey."

"Celeste!" Stella raised her voice. "Slow down! Did you forget last time you fell?"

Ethan immediately herded his sisters like a protective hen. "Listen to Mom."

Luna tilted her small face. "Where's Daddy? Still sleeping?"

"Young master started working before dawn," Benjamin glanced upstairs meaningfully. "Perhaps..."

Stella interrupted. "Let's go inside first. Don't keep Grandpa Benjamin standing."

The three children raced hand-in-hand toward the living room, their little shoes tapping against the floor. Benjamin trailed behind, then suddenly slapped his forehead. "Oh! I forgot to tell young master you're here!"

"No need for special announcements." Stella smoothed her skirt, eyes downcast.

"Young master's old injuries have been acting up, and these old legs can't climb stairs." Benjamin gave her a pointed look. "Perhaps..."

"Mom should call Daddy!" Celeste tugged her sleeve insistently.

Luna blinked with starry eyes. "Daddy must miss us."

Stella turned to her eldest. "Ethan..."

"The girls say they're hungry." Ethan took each sister's hand. "I'll take them to the kitchen with Grandpa Benjamin."

In a blink, the living room stood empty.

Stella stared at the spiral staircase, fingers unconsciously twisting her purse strap.

Upstairs, Adrian had been staring at untouched documents for ten minutes.

Vincent entered with a tea tray. "Madam's favorite Lu'an Melon Seed—"

"Coffee."

Three minutes later, steaming Blue Mountain coffee sat on the desk. As Adrian reached for it, Vincent opened his mouth to warn him—

"Adrian." A soft knock accompanied the familiar voice. "Are you free now?"

The porcelain cup crashed onto the papers, dark liquid spreading rapidly across the surface.
###Chapter 475: Pretend It Never Happened

When was the last time he heard Stella Valentine's voice? Adrian Roland's memory blurred. His fingers twitched, and the scalding coffee cup toppled over.

Vincent Astor lunged forward but was a second too late. The dark liquid splashed across Adrian's trousers as the porcelain shattered on the floor.

The loud crash startled Stella outside. She pushed the door open, her pupils contracting. "What happened?"

"Mrs. Roland." Vincent forced a smile.

Stella's gaze bypassed him entirely, landing on Adrian. "Are you alright?"

She stepped carefully around the mess, reaching for his soaked pants. Adrian caught her wrist. "I'll handle it."

Her brows knitted. The moment her fingertips brushed the damp fabric, her expression changed. "This is boiling hot!" Her voice trembled slightly. "We need to treat this now."

"No need." Adrian's eyes hungrily traced her features. She'd lost weight—her jawline sharper, faint shadows beneath her eyes.

"Vincent." Stella turned to the assistant.

Vincent had been staring blankly at the ceiling. He startled. "Huh?"

"Fetch fresh trousers and burn ointment." She was already clearing the desk with efficient motions. "I'll take care of this."

Vincent practically fled, nearly colliding with the doorframe in his haste.

The study fell silent enough to hear breathing.

"How...have you been?" Adrian's voice was rough.

"I'm fine." Stella pressed her lips together. "But you—"

Her fingers moved to unbuckle his belt. He stopped her again.

"I can manage," he insisted.

Stella inhaled deeply. "Adrian, your leg injury hasn't healed. This isn't the time for stubbornness."

Adrian said nothing. He remembered shielding her effortlessly from stray soccer balls during their campus walks. Now he couldn't even dodge a coffee cup.

"Not your fault," he murmured. "Don't force yourself."

Releasing her hand, he turned his face away. "It's just...I'm only wearing one pair today."

The moment the words left his mouth, both froze. Stella's ears turned scarlet. Adrian's throat bobbed.

The air thickened for several heartbeats.

"Pretend...this never happened," Adrian ground out.

But his movements were visibly sluggish. Stella couldn't bear it any longer—she reached over and unclasped his belt herself.
###Chapter 476: Burns and Heartaches

Adrian Roland's pupils constricted abruptly.

He hadn't expected Stella Valentine to reach out so suddenly.

"Little Star..." His voice trembled slightly.

Stella didn't respond, focusing solely on unbuckling his belt.

The motion felt achingly familiar.

During their passionate days, Adrian would always guide her hands to his waistband. At first, he taught her how to undo it—later, he'd simply close his eyes and savor her touch...

The memory made her movements more efficient.

With a soft click, the belt slid free and draped over the chairback.

She tugged his shirt hem loose, transforming the usually immaculate CEO into someone casually disheveled.

"Vincent said you took the kids to their kindergarten event?" Adrian attempted small talk.

"Mhm." Her hands remained gentle, careful to avoid his healing leg. "Does it hurt?"

"No."

His answer came too quickly—a telltale lie.

Stella yanked the pant leg down decisively, then froze at the sight of scalded skin.

The thin summer fabric had offered no protection against the boiling coffee.

She blotted the area with tissue, her fingertips brushing surgical scars with featherlight caution.

"Really no pain?"

"...Really."

Her half-formed smile vanished. She strode toward the door. "I'll get you fresh pants."

Outside, Vincent Astor scrambled away from eavesdropping.

In the bedroom, Stella retrieved lightweight shorts. The children's laughter floated from the living room where Benjamin Langley served snacks.

"Mommy's helping Daddy find something," the old butler explained.

"Are they making up?" Celeste Roland's eyes sparkled.

Ethan Valentine analyzed pragmatically: "They need more time."

The two younger girls already cheered.

Back in the study, Adrian clutched his untucked shirt with white-knuckled grip.

"I can manage," he muttered, ears burning crimson.

Stella suddenly recognized the role reversal.

He'd always been the one in control—their first kiss, skipping classes, those blush-inducing nights...

Even during their transactional evening, he'd held all the power.

A cool breeze dissipated the heated memories.

She efficiently swapped his pants. "Still hurting?"

Adrian stared at her proximity, words failing him.

A timely knock interrupted.

"Mr. Roland, Mrs. Roland—found the burn ointment!" Vincent's voice carried through the door.
###Chapter 477: Did He Dare to Hope?

Adrian's ears flushed pink as he stole furtive glances at Stella.

Seeing her expression remain calm as still water, the smile on his lips froze momentarily.

"The bandages are changed," he said in a low voice. "Just waiting for your burn ointment."

Vincent finally sauntered into the study, clutching a handful of medicinal creams.

"Madam, will any of these work?" He scratched his head. "I'm not very familiar with medications."

From anti-inflammatory creams to eczema ointments, he had brought everything imaginable.

Adrian's eye twitched imperceptibly.

An Ivy League graduate couldn't distinguish between basic ointments?

This was clearly deliberate stalling.

"Leave them," he said flatly.

Stella accepted the assortment, her fingertips lightly tapping two tubes. "This one for burns will suffice."

"Madam is amazing," Vincent said, eyes brightening.

"Vincent." Stella sighed. "Speak normally."

The assistant gave an embarrassed chuckle before suddenly thrusting the ointments toward her. "You should do it—I'm all thumbs."

Adrian turned his face away, pretending not to hear.

"It's simple." Stella pushed the tubes back. "Twice daily. You can manage."

She turned to Adrian. "Remember dietary restrictions."

"Little Star—"

The words caught in his throat.

Stella paused mid-step, then walked away without looking back.

Vincent leaned in. "Boss, Madam clearly—"

"Enough." Adrian lowered his gaze.

Whether she cared or not—it wasn't something he could presume to hope for anymore.

Downstairs, the children were feeding koi in the backyard.

Benjamin approached. "Is the young master badly injured?"

"Second-degree thigh burns. Not serious." Stella's tone softened slightly. "Please ensure he applies the medication properly."

"That stubborn boy." The old steward chuckled. "He won't escape my nagging."

An image flashed through Stella's mind—Adrian as a teenager with a fractured arm.

The tide of memories rose, and she swiftly severed the thought.
###Chapter 478: Rain Check

Seeing the situation turning precarious, Stella Valentine immediately stood up to leave. "Benjamin, I'm entrusting the children to you. There's an urgent matter at the company—I must go now."

She grabbed her purse and made a dash for the door, only to be stopped by Benjamin's firm grip.

"What's the rush?" He blocked her path with a plate of freshly baked cookies. "I made these especially for you—didn't even share them with the kids. Have some with hot chocolate."

As he headed toward the kitchen, he muttered under his breath: Why hasn't the young master come down yet? If he doesn't show up soon, she'll slip away.

"Really, I'm fine," Stella insisted, inching toward the exit. "I already had breakfast."

Her eyes kept darting to her watch, terrified the children might suddenly burst in from the backyard. If those three little ones latched onto her, escaping today would be impossible.

Benjamin's eyes gleamed with mischief. "At least say goodbye to them? I can't handle their tantrums if you disappear."

"Ethan will take care of his sisters." A confident smile touched her lips. "He's very responsible."

Benjamin faltered but refused to concede. "Then at least come for dinner tonight. I'll have the kitchen prepare your favorite sweet-and-sour ribs."

Stella froze.

"My mother is expecting me..." she hedged. "Besides, it's not a special occasion..."

"Since when do we need an occasion to eat?" Benjamin scowled. "Look how thin you've gotten! You're coming tonight, or I'll start packing the children's bags right now!"

Stella recoiled at the sudden threat.

"Maybe... another time?" she ventured.

Benjamin snorted. "Don't try that with me! This old man isn't senile enough to fall for your tricks!"

As precious seconds ticked by, Stella finally surrendered. "Alright, alright. I'll come after work."

"That's more like it." His stern expression melted into a grin. "Don't be late."

Relieved, Stella reached for the door—just as Vincent Astor came barreling down the stairs.

"Mrs. Roland! Your bag!"

She gasped, realizing she'd left her handbag upstairs.

"Thank you." Her fingers trembled slightly as she took it.

Vincent smiled. "Mr. Roland noticed it. He specifically asked me to bring it down immediately."

Stella's breath hitched. Her gaze flew to the second floor, but the hallway stood empty—only the curtains swayed gently.

"Please thank him for me." The words tumbled out as she bolted through the door without looking back.

Upstairs, Adrian Roland stood silently by his study window, watching her retreating figure until it vanished from sight.

Stella sprinted all the way to the office, barely making it through the doors before the clock struck nine.

"Stella?" Penny Anderson blinked at her, arms laden with files. "Since when does the boss punch in?"

"Bosses should lead by example." Stella steadied her breathing. "What's on the agenda today?"

Penny flipped open her tablet. "Sales just landed a major client. This afternoon, we're meeting with the runway coordinator about custom heritage jewelry."

Stella's eyes lit up. "Let me see the details."

"Here. They're interested in last season's Oriental Collection." Penny handed over the tablet. "The show's theme is 'Celestial Silhouettes.'"

Skimming through the materials, Stella's lips curved. "Perfect timing to debut our new cloisonné technique."
###Chapter 479: The Test of a Top Agent

After taking over Shi's Jewelry, Stella Valentine decisively abandoned her father's conservative business strategies and devoted herself to developing fusion jewelry. Within months, her unique designs attracted a flood of orders.

Penny Anderson flipped through the latest sales reports, impressed. "I was nervous when you announced the rebranding. But these pieces are dominating the market."

Stella chuckled at her awed expression. "Keep praising me and I'll get a big head. So, who's our contact for this project?"

The upcoming fashion show was a golden opportunity. Securing it would elevate the brand's reputation in the industry.

"It's Wendy Evans—the legendary agent who launched several supermodels before turning thirty-four," Penny said, pulling up her profile. "Jessica Blanchet made the introduction."

The woman in the photo had sharp eyes and a no-nonsense bob, radiating authority.

Stella tapped her desk thoughtfully. "An agent handling this personally? This show must be special." She closed the file. "Let's prepare thoroughly. We're meeting Wendy this afternoon."

Backstage buzzed with activity. Wendy immediately clasped Stella's hand. "I've heard so much about you. You're even more impressive in person."

Stella had chosen a beige suit—professional yet approachable. "You're too kind. I wouldn't dare show off in front of your models."

"Well said." Approval flashed in Wendy's eyes as she led the tour. "This collection needs to resonate with everyday audiences."

The outfits blended modern cuts with traditional motifs. Stella studied them before requesting, "Could we do a test styling? I have an idea."

Wendy summoned a newcomer. "Vivian, work with Ms. Valentine."

At twenty, Vivian had the delicate grace of a classical painting. Stella styled her hair into an elegant updo, applied subtle makeup, and finished with gold leaf floral accents on her forehead.

"Stunning!" Vivian gasped at her reflection. "You're better than professional stylists."

Stella smiled. "Different expertise. But..." She winked. "Once they see my jewelry, they'll be following my lead."

Her confidence was justified—Vivian now resembled a timeless beauty, the hairpins and forehead adornment harmonizing perfectly.

When Stella unveiled her jewelry case, Wendy's eyes lit up. "No wonder Jessica raved about you. These designs are extraordinary."

"All patented originals." Stella traced a jade hairpin. "Would you like to try one?"

The backstage erupted in excitement as models clustered around the collection. Stella moved among them, offering advice while Penny gave her a discreet thumbs-up—this showcase was theirs.
###Chapter 480: Too Much Wit Brings Sorrow, Too Deep Love Shortens Life

"This design is truly remarkable." Wendy Evans traced the jewelry's surface with her fingertips, the agate's smooth texture catching her eye. "The crystal's refraction effect is breathtaking."

She turned to watch the models strutting down the runway, nostalgia flickering in her gaze. "The organizers used similar materials during last season's fashion week. The visual impact was extraordinary."

Penny Anderson immediately understood. Her fingers flew across the tablet as she sent an urgent message to the legal department. The contract template needed to arrive tonight.

Stella Valentine noticed Wendy's lingering gaze on the models' accessories. "The finished pieces require time for polishing," she suggested softly. "Would you like to try them on first?"

"Me?" Wendy touched her short hair in surprise. "That wouldn't be appropriate. Where's Vivian?"

"Vivian's changing into her performance outfit," the makeup artist replied without looking up. "The lighting director needs to test effects."

Stella had already guided Wendy to the chair. "Short hair can make a striking statement." She studied the reflection in the mirror. "Your elegance suits classical styles perfectly."

As makeup brushes swept across Wendy's face, Stella retrieved materials from her kit. Silver threads danced between her fingers, transforming into minimalist hair clips within moments.

When the final accessory was secured, the mirror revealed a woman who seemed to have stepped through time. Wendy stared at her reflection, fingertips trembling as they brushed a tear at her eyelid.

"I'd forgotten..." Her voice cracked. "That I could still look like this."

Stella handed her a tissue. "Career and beauty aren't mutually exclusive."

"But what about love?" Wendy gave a bitter smile. "I don't even have time for dates anymore."

"Too much wit brings sorrow, too deep love shortens life." Stella's voice softened. "Betting everything on romance is dangerous."

Wendy nodded thoughtfully. "Like your designs—each one's a labor of love?"

"At least they don't make my hair fall out." Stella reached into her bag with a laugh when a candy packet suddenly tumbled out.

The rainbow-hued wrappers glittered under the lights. Wendy gasped. "Star Candy? These were discontinued years ago!"

Stella stared at the candy in her palm as memories came flooding back.
###Chapter 481: Memories of Star Candy

Stella Valentine froze when her fingertips brushed against the familiar wrapper.

Star Candy.

This long-discontinued treat had been the sweetest memory of her school days. Whenever her blood sugar dropped, Adrian Roland would magically produce one from his pocket.

"Isn't this..." Wendy Evans picked up a piece, examining it under the light. "My favorite candy from college?"

The dressing room buzzed with excitement. Stella shared the candies, watching nostalgic smiles bloom on everyone's faces.

Penny Anderson eagerly unwrapped hers. "If I could redo my youth, I'd memorize lottery numbers first!"

"I thought you'd say 'study harder.'" Stella chuckled.

"How boring!" Penny stuck out her tongue. "Don't you have anything you'd redo, Stella?"

Her smile faltered. While searching for tissues, her fingers grazed something cold and metallic.

A signature diamond-shaped jewelry box from New Frontier Group.

"What's wrong?" Penny leaned in curiously.

Stella snapped her bag shut, but the box tumbled out. Penny caught it deftly. "Wow! Isn't this our company's jewelry box?"

Wendy gave a knowing smile. "Mr. Roland certainly pays attention to detail."

Stella's ears burned. She knew exactly how these candies appeared—she'd left her bag in the study this morning. Adrian must have...

"Stella, you're blushing!" Penny teased.

"Nonsense." She forced composure. "It's just... warm in here."

Good-natured laughter filled the room. Stella clenched the jewelry box until its edges bit into her palm.

Just like her tangled emotions.

"Truth is..." Wendy said suddenly serious, "I've been through something similar. Some relationships defy outsiders' understanding."

Stella looked up into Wendy's perceptive gaze.

"Life is lived from the inside." Wendy patted her hand. "No one else tastes its sweetness or bitterness."

Stella stared at the candy dissolving on her tongue—sweet yet inexplicably bitter.

Like every piece Adrian had ever pressed into her palm.

"I should prepare for my next meeting." She stood abruptly, shoving the box into her bag.

As she turned, a single tear fell onto the candy wrapper, leaving a tiny damp circle.
###Chapter 482 The Approaching Storm

"Stella, are you still thinking about that woman from the news?" Wendy handed her a cup of hot tea, her fingers lightly tracing the rim. "Gossip like that is fleeting. I can't even remember what she looked like."

Penny stomped her foot in frustration. "Stella, that child has nothing to do with Mr. Roland! That woman just saw how wealthy the Roland Group is and wanted to extort money!"

Stella's fingers paused, sending ripples through the tea. "It's all in the past."

Wendy noticed the shift in her expression and quickly changed the subject. "Last month, one of my models gave up an international runway show for her childhood sweetheart. I was so angry I couldn't eat for three days." She chuckled. "But yesterday, I saw on her social media that they opened a cozy little inn in the countryside. They look happier than anyone."

"From school uniforms to wedding dresses!" Penny clasped her hands together, eyes sparkling. "That's the kind of love I dream about!"

Watching the falling leaves outside the window, Wendy murmured, "Back in school, I always wore my hair in a ponytail and was too shy to even accept love letters from boys in the next class. How silly that seems now."

Stella's lashes trembled, casting shadows under her eyes. "Sometimes meeting too soon isn't necessarily a good thing."

Penny nearly jumped out of her seat. "Stella! Love doesn't have a timeline! Giving up for that reason would be such a waste!"

"Just a passing thought." Stella set down her cup and spread out the papers on the table. "Even though the model is on leave, the designs can't wait. Wendy, would you prefer a unified jewelry style or custom pieces tailored to each outfit?"

Wendy's eyes lit up. "Custom designs would be amazing! But is there enough time?" She ran her fingers over the hair clip Stella had just made. "The craftsmanship is even finer than I expected."

"No problem." Stella pulled out her phone. "I'll take some close-ups of the outfits first. Silver base with agate and crystal accents—something they can wear daily after the show."

Penny's fingers flew across her tablet as she revised the contract. Just as the printer hummed to life, Stella's phone vibrated.

The name "Adrian Roland" burned into her vision like a brand.

[Weather Alert: Severe thunderstorm warning. Take shelter immediately...]

Stella shot to her feet. Outside, dark clouds loomed over the rooftops.

"A storm is coming." She grabbed her bag as the damp wind tousled her hair. "Wendy, let's discuss the details another day."

Penny scrambled to gather the design sketches as the first raindrop hit the window.
###Chapter 483 Thank You

"No way?" Penny Anderson hurried to the window, where a thin layer of condensation had already formed on the glass. "It didn't look like rain earlier."

Wendy Evans set down her design sketches, her expression serious. "The drainage system in the old district is outdated. A heavy downpour will cause flooding. Your office is so far—if you get stuck in traffic, it'll be a nightmare."

Stella Valentine glanced at her watch. The hour hand pointed to four. Remembering her promise to Benjamin Langley, she began gathering her files. "We should head out now. Feel free to reach out if anything comes up."

Their planned dinner would have to wait. Wendy laughed warmly. "Safety first. We'll celebrate after the fashion show wraps up."

"Absolutely." Stella nodded. "The models are in great form. This show will be a success."

Ten minutes later, their convoy left the studio. The sky darkened abruptly, heavy clouds pressing down as if night had fallen early.

Penny stared at the increasingly gloomy view outside, clicking her tongue. "That weather forecast was spot-on. What app do you use, Stella? Mine didn't give any alerts."

"Someone forwarded it to me," Stella replied casually, though her fingers absently traced the edge of her phone.

"Was it Mr. Roland?" Penny's eyes lit up. "It had to be him!"

Stella didn't deny it.

"He's thinking about you!" Penny smacked the car seat excitedly. "He tracked down those impossible-to-find Star Candies—why can't he just say what's on his mind?"

"Focus on work," Stella cut her off. "The show orders are critical for the company's survival. We need to act fast once we're back."

Penny straightened immediately. "I've already notified the group chat. Do we need to increase raw material orders?"

"Wait until I've inspected the samples." Stella flipped open her notebook. "I'll finalize the hairpin base designs tonight. Make sure production is ready."

Under the strong runway lights, intricate hairpin details would be lost. Stella decided to simplify the patterns to meet the deadline.

"Does the design team need to step in?" Penny asked, taking notes.

"I'll handle the initial phase. Everyone can contribute later." Stella's gaze was resolute. "Shi's Jewelry must become an industry benchmark—not just rely on one person."

Penny marveled silently at her ambition, though she knew the immense pressure it carried.

Their convoy crawled through the torrential rain. By the time they reached the office, visibility had dropped to less than five meters.

The driver wiped rainwater from his face. "Good thing we left early. The main roads are gridlocked now."

Penny gasped as she scrolled through news alerts. "The old district's traffic is paralyzed! Police are redirecting vehicles."

Stella stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, watching the city blur behind the downpour. She pulled out her phone and sent two words to a familiar number: [Thank you]

Raindrops hammered against the glass, echoing the unspoken emotions of a certain someone.
###Chapter 484: Divide and Conquer

The sky outside darkened abruptly, heavy clouds hanging oppressively low.

Stella Valentine was absorbed in refining the floral details on her jewelry design, fingers dancing across the keyboard. Only when a blinding lightning bolt split the sky did she realize the approaching storm.

Her phone screen flickered with a lone notification—a reminder message from Adrian Roland.

"Stella!" Penny Anderson burst in, arms laden with files. "The weather bureau just issued a red alert. This rain won't let up anytime soon."

Stella turned to the window. Torrential rain submerged the city in mist, droplets hammering against the glass like ominous drumbeats.

"Contact Benjamin for me," she massaged her temples. "Tell him tonight's dinner is canceled."

Penny's eyes widened. "But the kids are waiting at the Roland estate! Ethan just texted asking when you'll arrive."

A thunderclap shook the office, making the water glass on her desk tremble.

Stella's fingers stilled. She remembered Celeste clinging to her neck that morning, chirping about their promised hot pot dinner.

"It's too dangerous to drive in this weather," she heard herself say.

As Penny reached for her phone, Stella's device rang. Vincent Astor's name flashed on the screen.

"Mrs. Roland," came Vincent's voice, distorted by rainfall. "Grace has arrived at the estate. The children were thrilled to see their grandmother—Luna keeps asking for you."

Stella clenched her phone. She should've known—Adrian always planned three steps ahead.

"How did Mother—"

"Mr. Roland said you'd worry about Grace being home alone," Vincent chuckled. "So he sent me to fetch her first. The hot pot ingredients are all prepared now."

Penny whispered beside her, "All company cars are flooded. Taxis have a two-hour wait..."

The rain intensified against the windows.

Stella closed her eyes. She could see the children gathered around the steaming pot, her mother's gentle smile, and... that silent figure lurking in the shadows.

"Stella," Penny leaned in suddenly, "some things need to be said face-to-face."

The words pierced like a needle. Stella scoffed, "Tell Vincent I'm avoiding spicy food lately."

"What?" Penny blinked. "But yesterday you promised the kids—"

"Ask him," Stella pushed the phone away. "Who warned me about dry weather this morning?"

The office fell silent except for the raging storm outside.

Both Penny and Vincent went quiet.
###Chapter 485: Who's Lying?

The call ended abruptly, leaving Penny Anderson and Vincent Astor frozen in place.

"Stella said no, and that's final!" Stella Valentine snapped her phone shut, eyes glistening with unshed tears. "If you're here to speak for Adrian Roland again, you can leave right now!"

Penny raised her hands in surrender. "I'm sorry, Stella! I won't mention it again!"

She scurried back to her desk like a startled rabbit, sighing at her computer screen. Dealing with this stubborn couple was harder than negotiating a multinational merger.

Vincent stared at his overheated phone, watching raindrops thicken against the window. The CEO had truly messed up this time. When Mrs. Roland dug her heels in, not even a team of wild horses could change her mind.

The dial tone mocked his attempt to call back.

"Benjamin," Vincent massaged his temples. "Initiate Plan B. I'm out of my depth."

Rain drummed against the car window when Stella's phone lit up again. "I told you I'm not—"

"Stella!" Benjamin Langley's panicked voice cut through. "Celeste fell down the stairs!"

Files slipped from Stella's grasp, scattering across the floor.

"She won't stop crying for you," Benjamin's voice trembled. "The doctor says it's not serious, but she's terrified—"

"I'm coming!"

Stella grabbed her coat with shaking hands. Celeste's heart surgery was only six months ago. Any accident could trigger complications.

Penny jumped as the office door slammed open. "Stella?"

"Celeste's hurt!" Stella's voice cracked. "Get Vincent to drive!"

Each descending elevator floor felt like torture. Stella kept redialing, but Benjamin's line stayed busy.

The car barely stopped before Stella plunged into the downpour.

"Stella! Your umbrella!" Penny chased after her, catching only icy raindrops.

The Roland residence blazed with light. Soaked to the bone, Stella burst through the door, water darkening the foyer rug.

"Where's Celeste?"

Giggles floated from the children's room before she finished speaking.

On the living room couch, Adrian Roland had become a human jungle gym for three children. Celeste perched on his shoulders, waving a toy sword—not a trace of injury in sight.

Stella's clenched fists slowly uncurled.

She wiped rainwater from her face, eyes sharp as daggers. "Adrian. You taught our child to lie?"
###Chapter 486: Children Shouldn't Be Spoiled

"What idea?" Adrian frowned slightly, his gaze shifting between Benjamin and Stella. He genuinely didn't know the old butler's plan, only sensing that something had been arranged.

The three children clung to Adrian the moment they returned from school. Luna and Celeste hugged his arms on either side while Ethan sat on his lap, all three chattering nonstop, too excited to even watch cartoons.

Stella stood at the staircase, gripping the railing tightly. Her eyes were red-rimmed, her voice trembling with suppressed anger. "Using a child's injury to trick me—do you think that's funny? Don't you understand what Celeste means to me?"

Adrian was stunned by her sudden outburst. It had been a long time since he'd seen Stella so visibly upset. Instinctively, he softened his tone. "I'm sorry, I—"

He gently patted Luna and Celeste's backs. "Daddy needs to get Mommy a towel. Play with your brother for a bit, okay?"

"No!" Celeste tightened her grip on his arm and looked up at Stella. "Mommy, we want to stay with you."

Luna climbed onto Adrian's back like a koala, refusing to let go.

Stella took a deep breath. Already furious about the deception, she grew even more irritated by the children's lack of discipline. "Get down from Daddy right now. How many times have I told you not to be so rude?"

The girls flinched at her sharp tone and immediately slid off Adrian, nervously twisting their fingers together.

Ethan quickly stepped forward. "Mom, it's my fault for not watching them. Please don't be mad."

Seeing their timid expressions, Stella's anger faded slightly.

Adrian pulled the children close. "It's fine to relax at home. Even if you tear the roof down, Daddy will fix it."

"Children shouldn't be spoiled." Stella frowned. "Rules are important. I know you want to make it up to them, but there have to be boundaries."

Luna and Celeste hung their heads, hands clasped tightly. "Mommy, we're sorry..."

Adrian ruffled their hair. "Mommy just wants what's best for you..."

Watching the four of them, Stella suddenly felt like the villain. She turned and headed upstairs. "I'm going to change."

Her old belongings were still neatly arranged in their original places at the Roland residence. She quickly found fresh clothes and changed. When she came back downstairs, Grace had already arrived.

"Stella," Grace greeted warmly, "I heard the kids were staying here tonight, so I came over. Did you get caught in the rain?"

"No, Vincent drove me." Not wanting to worry her mother, Stella changed the subject. "How did you get here so fast?"

Grace smiled. "Benjamin said we're having hot pot tonight, so I came to help. The bone broth is ready, and there's corn and ribs in the mild side. Have a bowl later."

"It smells amazing!" Penny poked her head out from the kitchen like a cat drawn to fish. "This double-flavored pot is incredible!"

The chef brought out a steaming copper pot, the rich aroma making everyone's mouths water.

Benjamin cheerfully directed, "Kids sit on the mild side, everyone else can choose. Miss Anderson, be careful—it's hot."

"Got it!" Penny eagerly dropped beef balls into the spicy broth. "These need more time to soak up the flavor."

Vincent rolled his eyes and added cabbage to the mild side. "Don't just eat spicy food. Have some soup to warm your stomach."

"Pfft, I can handle extreme spice!" Penny stuck out her tongue, making everyone laugh.

The atmosphere grew lively. When they gathered around the table, Stella noticed the only empty seat was beside Adrian.

"Mom," she turned to Grace, "why don't you eat first? I'll take care of the kids."

Grace shook her head with a smile. "Benjamin can help. Sit down and eat."

Reluctantly, Stella took her seat. Adrian wordlessly pushed a warm bowl of soup toward her. "Have some first."

"...Thanks."
###Chapter 487 Hidden Agendas

Stella's porcelain spoon paused mid-air as the warm broth slid down her throat, dispelling the lingering chill. Only then did she notice her clothes still carried the dampness from the rain, sending a shiver down her spine.

At the other end of the table, Penny and Vincent were locked in a heated battle over the last beef meatball.

"I saw it first!" Penny glared at the bubbling pot, chopsticks poised like weapons.

Vincent swiftly intercepted with his own chopsticks. "Finders keepers."

"That's cheating!" Penny stomped her foot. "We agreed to split them evenly!"

The three children watched the spectacle with glee, their giggles punctuating the argument. Ethan even set down his utensils, propping his chin in his hands to enjoy the show.

Stella sighed and used serving chopsticks to give each combatant a meatball. "You're setting a bad example for the kids."

Ethan immediately straightened, mimicking adult seriousness. "Exactly. You should share."

Vincent reluctantly released the contested meatball into Penny's bowl. "Ladies first."

Penny took a triumphant bite, exaggerating her enjoyment. "Delicious!"

Adrian observed the scene, the tension in his shoulders easing slightly. Through the rising steam of the hot pot, he murmured to Stella, "Mr. Langley... meant no harm."

"I know." She lowered her gaze, stirring her bowl absently.

"After Grandfather passed, the house became too quiet." Adrian's voice was barely audible. "The children... they brought life back to this place."

Stella's fingers stilled, but she offered no reply.

As the lively dinner wound down, Penny suggested playing Gomoku. After three consecutive losses, her face turned stormy.

"Just admit defeat." Vincent smirked. "Even the kids could beat you."

Penny's eyes darted toward the window. "The rain stopped! I need to feed my cat!" She grabbed her purse and fled, leaving Vincent bewildered.

Stella looked outside at the freshly washed night sky. Rising with quiet relief, she said, "Mom, we should go."

Grace glanced at the children. "What about them?"

Stella crouched to their eye level. "Sweethearts, do you want to come home with Mommy or stay with Daddy a little longer?"

Luna tugged her sleeve. "Can't you stay, Mommy?"

"Mommy has work tomorrow." Stella smoothed her daughter's hair.

Celeste immediately clung to her arm. "We'll go with you! We can visit Daddy tomorrow!"

The innocent declaration drew soft laughter from the adults. Adrian lowered himself carefully with his cane. "Daddy's door is always open."

He helped the children into their coats and instructed Vincent to see them home. His every movement was measured, polite—so unlike the Adrian she once knew.

"Next weekend..." Stella hesitated. "I'll bring them over again."

Adrian's eyes brightened, his lips curving unconsciously. "Good. My leg should be better by then. I can play with them properly."

Something fluttered in Stella's chest, but words failed her. She nodded slightly. As she turned away, she caught the faintest sigh behind her.
###Chapter 488: How to Prove Innocence?

These days, Stella Valentine and Adrian Roland maintained a tacit distance. All necessary communications were handled through brief text messages. From coordinating child pickups to confirming business collaboration details, they operated with seamless efficiency.

Each message was strictly professional, devoid of any personal sentiment. Ironically, this arrangement boosted their productivity.

One afternoon, Stella was absorbed in revising design drafts in her office when Penny Anderson burst in, her face flushed with anger. "Stella, have you seen what these reporters wrote? It's outrageous!"

"More rumors about Shi's Jewelry?" Stella set down her pen, brows knitting slightly. "We won't tolerate it this time."

Since Shi's successful collaboration with Wendy Evans' modeling team, envy had festered in the industry. Some had resorted to spreading baseless plagiarism accusations, their tactics growing increasingly underhanded.

Penny nodded vehemently. "They need to pay for this!"

But when Stella scanned the news article on the tablet, her expression shifted subtly. She exhaled softly. "This is what upset you?"

"Of course!" Penny blinked in confusion. "Stella, why aren't you angry?"

A faint smile touched Stella's lips. "The reporters stated facts—no fabrication, no defamation. They merely speculated based on available information. Why waste energy on such gossip?"

She picked up her design again, noticing Penny still hovering. "Instead of fuming, focus on preparing for this afternoon's client meeting. Are the materials ready?"

"They're ready." Penny hesitated. "But these rumors are spreading like wildfire. Everyone believes them..."

Lately, Stella and Adrian had indeed avoided public appearances together. Combined with her sudden solo leadership of Shi's Jewelry, speculation about their impending divorce had exploded. Opportunistic journalists had pounced, dissecting their relationship with salacious "insights" and dredged-up history.

The article quickly topped entertainment headlines.

At first, Stella found it absurd. They weren't celebrities—why the scrutiny?

Then came the weary realization.

Blame Adrian's prominence. His every move swayed New Frontier Group's stock prices. Allies and rivals alike watched him relentlessly.

Meanwhile, Adrian received the same news. His expression darkened as he summoned Vincent Astor. "Identify the media outlet. Have Legal handle it."

The air around him turned glacial.

"Understood, sir." Vincent mentally pitied the publication. "Should we demand a retraction or issue a clarification?"

Clarification?

What could they possibly clarify in their current situation?

Adrian's chest tightened. He waved a dismissive hand. "...Just get it taken down first."
###Chapter 489: An Unexpected Invitation

Stella Valentine pushed the café incident to the back of her mind, focusing on organizing the documents in her hands. The meeting with the European client was today's main event.

The glass door of the café swung open, and a young man with blond hair and blue eyes walked in. His tailored navy-blue suit exuded the elegance of a European gentleman.

"William Aldridge." He extended his hand, introducing himself in fluent Mandarin. "Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Valentine."

Stella shook his hand, slightly surprised. "I didn't expect you to be so young."

William chuckled warmly. "I was just transferred from London to the Milan headquarters. This negotiation is my initiation test."

Penny Anderson, sitting nearby, discreetly eyed the handsome client and nearly choked on her coffee. Stella swiftly steadied her cup and murmured, "Careful, it's hot."

"Sorry." Penny blushed as she dropped two sugar cubes into her coffee.

William's gaze lingered on Stella for a moment before he smiled. "The espresso here is authentic—reminds me of cafés in Milan."

"Absolutely." Stella's eyes brightened. "When I studied there, I loved the old shop near the central station."

"You've been there?" William leaned forward, delighted. "Their tiramisu is divine."

They quickly found common ground. Stella reminisced about her student days in Milan, while William shared amusing anecdotes from his work in London.

"London's tea is truly exceptional." Stella's lips curved into a faint smile as a memory surfaced. "But their experimental cuisine..."

William laughed knowingly. "As terrifying as pineapple on pizza!"

Stella recalled an awkward experience years ago with Adrian Roland in London. They had eagerly ordered a dish called "Starry Sky," only to be served a plate of charred sesame cakes.

"If you'd like, I could take you for a proper English afternoon tea sometime." William's blue eyes sparkled with anticipation. "Together?"

The sudden invitation caught Stella off guard. She noticed the way he looked at her—it wasn't just the gaze of a business partner.
###Chapter 490: Boss, Someone's Trying to Steal Your Girl!

The café was filled with rich aromatic scents.

Stella Valentine and William Aldridge's conversation gradually shifted from business collaboration to European culture, their discussion flowing effortlessly. Penny Anderson sat nearby, already on her second cup of coffee.

"These are my latest designs." Stella pulled several sketches and an exquisite velvet flower sample from her bag.

William's eyes lit up. "Magnificent! Exactly the Eastern aesthetic I've been searching for."

With a faint smile, Stella swiped open a runway video on her tablet. "This is our collection for Fashion Week."

"Each piece is one-of-a-kind?" William traced the velvet petals.

"Mass production ensures better efficiency," Stella explained. "Runways demand uniqueness, but the market values consistent quality."

William promptly produced a pen. "Let's sign the contract then."

The terms were far more generous than expected. Stella's eyes sparkled as she signed with practiced ease. Penny discreetly gave a thumbs-up.

"How about dinner tonight?" William suddenly proposed, emerald eyes gleaming.

Stella declined politely. "Apologies, I need to pick up my children."

"Your...children?" His expression froze.

"Three of them." She checked her watch. "The coffee's on me."

As William insisted on paying, Penny already had her phone out.

The atmosphere in New Frontier Group's executive office turned glacial.

Vincent Astor cautiously asked, "Bad day, Mr. Roland?"

"Would you be cheerful?" Penny rolled her eyes. "That William guy was practically undressing Stella with his eyes. Even asked her to dinner."

"You didn't stop him?" Vincent's voice rose an octave.

"Stella used the kids as an excuse." Penny shrugged. "But that guy looked determined."

Thirty minutes later, Stella's phone buzzed incessantly.

Adrian Roland had sent over twenty texts.

The first contained William's complete dossier.

The second meticulously listed all his ex-girlfriends.

From the third onward came detailed psychological analyses of William's character flaws.

Stella replied with a single question mark before stepping into the elevator.

In the underground garage, a statuesque woman blocked her path. "Miss Star?"
###Chapter 491 The Official Girlfriend

"It's me." Stella Valentine nodded slightly, her eyes flickering with confusion. She was certain she'd never met this woman before.

The woman appeared to be in her early twenties, yet carried an air of quiet maturity. Her delicate features were accentuated by striking almond-shaped eyes that tilted slightly upward, giving her a radiant charm. Stella found herself studying the woman's face.

"Can I help you?" Stella broke the silence.

The woman smiled warmly. "Actually, I have a favor to ask." Her voice was as clear as a mountain spring. "I came because I admire your work. This earring—it's one of your designs, isn't it?"

She tucked a strand of dark hair behind her ear, revealing a crabapple-shaped earring. The delicate fringe swayed with her movement, catching the light.

Stella's eyes brightened in recognition. It was a piece she'd originally designed, later refined by Adrian Roland.

"Thank you for appreciating it," Stella said sincerely.

"Would you join me for dinner?" The woman's eyes sparkled with anticipation. "There's a lovely restaurant nearby with a peaceful atmosphere."

After a brief hesitation, Stella agreed. "Give me a moment to make a call."

She stepped aside and dialed Penny Anderson. "Could you pick up the kids for me? A client requested an impromptu meeting."

"Male or female?" Penny's tone turned alert.

"Relax, it's a female client who admires our designs."

"Good." Penny exhaled in relief. "Consider it done."

Hanging up, Stella returned with an apologetic smile. "Sorry for the wait."

"Perfect timing." The woman's smile remained gracious. "Mind if I ride with you?"

Their conversation flowed effortlessly during the drive, ranging from classical design aesthetics to current fashion trends. An unexpected camaraderie blossomed between them.

At the restaurant, the woman took a sip of lemon water. "Miss Valentine lives up to her reputation. No wonder William speaks so highly of you."

Stella's fork paused mid-air over her pasta.

"William?"

"My boyfriend." A rosy blush tinted the woman's cheeks. "He mentions you often. I specifically came to meet you."

Stella set down her utensils. Her pulse quickened.

So this wasn't a casual client meeting.

This was an ambush.
###Chapter 492: Even Heroes Fall for Beauty

"Are you alright?" The woman frowned slightly, her tone probing.

"I'm fine." Stella Valentine took a sip of coffee, her gaze lingering on the delicate earrings the woman wore. "I just didn't expect you to be so interested in oriental-inspired jewelry. William seems more inclined toward British styles."

A sweet smile curved the woman's lips. "Love is about compromise. He's willing to explore oriental culture for me—even collaborating with your company. That's what matters."

"He must care deeply for you," Stella replied politely.

A blush tinted the woman's cheeks. "Sorry I'm late. I hope I didn't disrupt your meeting."

"Not at all." Stella assumed she was here for the design discussion. "We just signed the contract. The sketches haven't started yet."

The woman's eyes brightened. "Perfect. Men lack an eye for detail, especially with cross-cultural designs. I worried he might have overlooked something."

Stella's smile faded slightly. "William strikes me as quite astute. I doubt he'd make such mistakes."

"You'd be surprised." The woman chuckled meaningfully. "British men don't understand our saying—'Even heroes fall for beauty.' Don't you agree?"

The implication finally clicked.

This wasn't about jewelry. It was a territorial claim.

Irritation simmered in Stella's chest. Since when did business meetings involve entertaining clients' girlfriends?

"Could I see the design direction?" the woman pressed.

Suppressing her annoyance, Stella nodded. "Of course."

The woman flipped through the documents with feigned interest. "Balancing oriental elements with European tastes is crucial."

"Indeed." Stella's tone turned icy.

Abruptly, the woman shifted topics. "I felt a connection with you the moment we met. William can be... impulsive. If he's done anything inappropriate, I apologize on his behalf. He treats everyone that way—nothing personal."

"We only met today," Stella said bluntly. "His assistant handled all prior communications."

The woman sipped her tea gracefully. "Of course. William always maintains boundaries."

The air grew thick with tension. Stella stirred her coffee, willing the conversation to end.

"Oh," the woman added suddenly, "our anniversary is coming up. Any gift suggestions?"

Stella shook her head. "I barely know William. I can't advise you."

"Right." The woman sighed. "Some girls misinterpret his kindness."

Stella nearly laughed. "Maybe he should wear a wedding band? Our company designs excellent couples' rings."

It was the politest jab she could muster.

The woman's smile stiffened. She signaled for the check. "So many misunderstandings today. This coffee is on me."

Stella didn't argue. As she reached for her phone, she froze—over a dozen missed calls from Penny Anderson.

Her stomach dropped. She was about to call back when the phone rang again.

"Stella!" Penny's voice trembled. "The kindergarten said a woman picked up the kids! Where are you?"
###Chapter 493: Don't You Trust Me?

"Who picked them up? When?" Stella's fingers trembled, barely gripping her phone. She forced herself to stay composed. "I've been at the restaurant this whole time. I never left."

Penny's voice cracked with panic. "They were taken right before I arrived. What should we do?"

"Stay calm." Stella took a deep breath. "Ethan knows better than to go with strangers. Let me check with his teacher first."

The homeroom teacher sounded relieved when she answered. "A middle-aged woman came for him. He seemed happy to see her, so I assumed she was family."

Stella's racing heart slowed slightly. She massaged her temples. "My apologies. It must have been my mother."

She immediately called Grace. "Mom, are the kids home?"

"What?" Grace's voice rose sharply. "Aren't they with you? When you didn't come back, I thought—" She suddenly went silent, breathing unevenly. "Stella, tell me they're not—"

"It's fine!" Stella cut in. "Adrian took them. I assumed he'd bring them home."

Grace sounded doubtful. "Are you sure?"

"Of course." Cold sweat coated Stella's palm. "I just didn't want to deal with him."

She hung up and dialed Adrian's number. Each ring stretched endlessly.

"Yes?" His deep voice finally answered.

"Did you send someone for the children?" she demanded.

Adrian remained calm. "We'll talk when you get here."

"What's going on?" Her voice tightened. "A stranger took our kids!"

A quiet sigh came through the line. "Stella, don't you trust me?"

Those words acted like a sedative. Her tense muscles relaxed slightly as she hailed a cab to the Roland estate.

Benjamin waited at the gates, hurrying forward when she arrived. "Miss Stella, the young master said you'd come. I almost didn't believe him."

"Where are they?" She rushed inside.

"In the living room," Benjamin said, leading the way. "The master said it was too complicated to explain over—"

Ethan came barreling down the hallway before he could finish. "Mom!"

Luna and Celeste abandoned their crayons on the coffee table and toddled over. The impact of their small bodies nearly knocked Stella backward, her eyes burning.

She scanned the room. "What on earth...?"
###Chapter 494: Like a Lifetime Ago

The children gathered around her unharmed—no injuries, no fright. This should have been a relief.

But the bizarre turn of events left her struggling to process it all.

Benjamin was about to explain when a familiar figure approached. The woman bent down and spoke gently to the children, "The steamed buns are ready, but only one each. Too many will spoil your dinner."

She was a middle-aged woman dressed simply yet neatly. Her round face, hair coiled in a bun, and kind eyes radiated warmth.

Stella's pupils contracted. "Martha?!"

Memories flooded back—the night Mr. Alistair's car crashed, Mr. Xavier's life-threatening ultimatum, her forced exile overseas...

Martha had believed they were leaving as planned, unaware of the turmoil that followed. She beamed. "You look even more radiant than before, Miss Stella."

The years of managing Shi's Jewelry had stripped away her time for vanity but honed her into a poised career woman.

"Motherhood teaches independence," Stella deflected lightly, her gaze sweeping the empty living room before settling on the study upstairs.

Benjamin seized the chance to excuse himself, vanishing toward the kitchen.

Ethan bounded to Martha's side, eyes sparkling. "Martha, are we having cola chicken wings tonight? And your chicken wonton soup?"

The usually composed boy transformed into an eager little foodie. Martha chuckled. "Wontons, yes. Chicken wings tomorrow. Or your tummy won't have room."

Stella pinched her son's cheek playfully. "No bedtime stories if you overeat."

"I don't need them!" Ethan puffed his chest before dutifully taking his sisters' hands. "Homework time."

Once they were gone, Stella turned to Martha. "Did Adrian bring you back?"

"Only recently did I learn from the news that 'Mr. Alistair' was actually CEO Roland." Martha glowed with approval. "Such a blessed match—he treats you so well, and the children are brilliant..."

Stella's smile faltered. She too had once been oblivious to her husband's dual identity.

Martha suddenly looked contrite. "My apologies about fetching the children without notice."

Stella's breath caught. Adrian's calm demeanor earlier now made sense.

"When did you return? Will you stay?"

"Just arrived today." Martha sighed. "My daughter-in-law and I don't get along, and my son's always absent. Better to work than stew. When Mr. Roland called, I came straightaway!"

So Adrian had been searching for a nanny all along. Stella's nose tingled. During those dark years, Martha's kindness had been as precious as Mr. Alistair's solace.

"Stay, just like before."

"Gladly!" Martha wiped her hands cheerfully. "Your favorite wontons are simmering—let me check them."

As she hurried off, the study door creaked open. Penny gasped, "Stella? How—"
###Chapter 495: I'm Jealous

Stella Valentine paused at the stairwell corner, spotting Penny Anderson standing in the living room, bowing nervously to Adrian Roland. Her steps faltered as an inexplicable anger surged within her.

"Stella!" Penny jumped like a startled rabbit upon seeing her. "I swear it wasn't my idea! Mr. Roland said Martha took the kids and made me keep it from you—"

Stella's lips curled into a cold smile. "So you helped him lie to me?"

Penny stomped her foot in frustration. "I was terrified! I almost called the police! If Mr. Roland hadn't called when he did—"

"Enough." Stella cut her off. "Where is he?"

"In... in the study." Penny shrank back. "Please don't be angry. He must have had his reasons..."

Ignoring her, Stella marched upstairs. She needed answers—why did he always use the children as an excuse to lure her here?

Just as she reached the study door, it swung open.

Adrian stood in the doorway, leaning on his cane, his gaze intense. "I heard everything."

Stella turned her face away. "Good. Saves me repeating myself."

"I'm sorry." His voice was low. "I didn't think it through."

She bit her lip, the accusations she'd prepared dissolving at the sight of his pale complexion and the cane in his hand.

"I heard you met with William Aldridge."

Her head snapped up. "Are you having me followed?"

"No." He gave a bitter smile. "Vincent happened to see you. Stella, that man—"

"My clients are none of your concern." Her tone was icy.

Adrian's eyes darkened. "I know. I just... I'm jealous."

The word hit her like a physical blow.

"In school, I intercepted every love letter those boys wrote you." His laugh was self-deprecating. "Some habits never change."

Her heart skipped. So that was why no one had pursued her in high school.

"William is far more dangerous than those schoolboys." Adrian's voice tightened. "I'm afraid you—"

"Afraid of what?" she challenged. "That I'll be fooled? Adrian, I'm not that naive girl anymore."

"I know." His voice softened. "But I can't help it."

The raw vulnerability in his eyes—something the once-confident Adrian would never have shown—struck her deeply.

"I asked Martha to take the kids because she missed them." He paused. "And because... I wanted to see you."

Her breath caught. Such directness left her unprepared.

Children's laughter floated up from downstairs, making the silence between them heavier. Suddenly, Stella realized her anger had faded.

"Don't do it again." That was all she said before turning toward the stairs.

Watching her go, Adrian allowed himself a small smile. He knew—she'd forgiven him.
###Chapter 496: Consider Me First

Stella Valentine whirled around, her pupils dilating slightly.

Adrian Roland immediately fumbled for words. "I didn't mean to—I would never force you. I just wanted... to look at you a little longer. I promise I won't use the children as an excuse to bring you here again."

This version of Adrian was unfamiliar to her.

From the moment they'd met, he had always been composed and strategic. Even when Vincent Atlante had suddenly appeared to disrupt their lives, Adrian had methodically countered every move. When had he ever been this vulnerable?

The few times he'd miscalculated had all been for her sake.

"I know," Stella said softly. "You don't need to explain. I understand."

Seeing she wasn't angry, the tension in Adrian's shoulders eased slightly. "I'd already decided not to disturb you anymore. You're free to go wherever you want, live however you please. I thought if I didn't see you, maybe the pain would lessen. But then you came back, moving into the old house under the pretense of taking care of the children..."

"Vincent escaping justice was my fault," Stella bit her lip. "I was afraid you'd be angry..."

"Yes, I was furious. After all these years, how could you not recognize me? But what hurt most was that you could tell us apart—yet you still helped him. I know you hate me, but that doesn't make it any less painful."

"Have you been drinking?"

"No."

"...You're talking a lot tonight."

Adrian lowered his head with a quiet laugh. "I know. Annoying, isn't it?"

"That's not what I meant."

"It doesn't matter. Nothing does anymore. I just thought... since I finally have this chance to speak with you alone, I might as well say what's in my heart. Better than tiptoeing around you every day."

Stella stayed silent.

"Little Star, you already know what I want to say. Today, I just want you to know this—the world is vast. Fly wherever you wish. I won't stop you, and I won't chain you down. But if you ever grow tired and need a harbor..." His voice trembled slightly. "Could you... consider me first?"

Stella's nose stung.

"You don't have to answer. I've said my piece, and you've heard it. That's enough." Adrian gently changed the subject. "Martha's wontons are almost ready. If you're upset, eat a little more."

By her estimate, the wontons should be done.

They descended the stairs one after the other. Stella walked ahead but couldn't resist glancing back to ensure he made it down safely.

In the dining room, Martha was waiting anxiously. "Mr. Roland, Miss Valentine, come quickly! The wontons are ready! I also made some side dishes you love, Miss Valentine!"

The children, hearing their favorite wontons were served, cheered and rushed toward the table—until Penny Anderson swiftly herded them to wash their hands.

Watching the children's lively antics lifted Stella's mood slightly. She didn't want to dampen Martha's spirits with a cold expression. "It's been so long since I've had wontons this delicious. I can never get the flavor right when I make them."

"It's not hard—just takes patience with the broth," Martha beamed, delighted to discuss cooking. "If you'd like to learn, I can teach you later."

"I've been too busy lately... Maybe another time." Stella hedged.

Learning to make wontons tonight would mean staying over again.

This time, she waited until Penny returned with the children before taking her seat, deliberately positioning herself between them. But Adrian sat directly across from her.

Now every time she reached for a dish, she met his gaze. Stella kept her head down, eating mechanically—even her beloved chicken wonton soup tasted bland.

Martha, assuming the couple was just having a minor spat, cheerfully set out utensils. "Miss Valentine, try these—I added nourishing ingredients. Very good for your health."

"Thank you." Stella used the motion of ladling soup to avoid his eyes. The hot broth warmed her from within. "Still as delicious as ever."

Martha grinned. "Eat more! There's plenty in the fridge—pork filling, shrimp filling. And I've got chicken broth simmering on the stove. Perfect for noodles too."

As Martha chattered, memories of warmth from the Rose Garden days flooded Stella's mind, gradually lifting her spirits.

"Ah, Miss Valentine, you're too thin—you need proper nourishment," Martha suddenly sighed. "Celeste mentioned wanting a baby brother. You'll need to build up your strength first. A woman's postpartum recovery is crucial—neglect it, and the consequences can last a lifetime..."

"Cough—!"
###Chapter 497: Easily Flustered

Stella Valentine had just lifted a spoonful of hot soup when Adrian Roland's words nearly made her choke. She coughed violently as a tissue appeared before her.

"Thanks." She took it without looking up, assuming Penny Anderson had handed it to her.

"You're welcome."

That familiar deep voice made her head snap up. Adrian's amused eyes met hers, and she realized the tissue had come from him. Her ears burned instantly.

"I was thanking Penny," she said stiffly.

Adrian withdrew his hand unfazed. "Just didn't want you choking. Need another tissue?"

Little Celeste focused on her wontons, cheeks puffed like a chipmunk. Ethan, sensing tension, swiftly popped a cherry tomato into Luna's mouth before she could ask questions.

"Yes." Stella snatched the tissue from his hand and ducked her head to continue eating under everyone's puzzled stares.

Martha Clementson gave Penny a questioning look, but the secretary subtly shook her head in warning.

"Come, try my pear soup!" Benjamin Langley's booming voice broke the silence as he carried in a steaming pot. "This dry weather calls for something moisturizing—"

He froze when both Stella and Adrian's expressions turned rigid.

Pear soup.

Memories of that night flooded back simultaneously.

They lowered their heads in unison, suddenly very interested in their wontons.

Benjamin belatedly realized his blunder. "It's just plain pear soup! Nothing else added, I swear!"

Stella forced a laugh, wishing she could vanish into her bowl.

The three children exchanged confused glances, curiosity shining in six wide eyes.

"Does Mommy not like the fritillary in pear soup?" Celeste piped up. "It's so bitter!" She held out her bowl eagerly. "Grandpa Ben, can I try?"

Adrian cleared his throat, catching Stella's crimson ears from the corner of his eye. His lips curved involuntarily.

Still so easily flustered.

Oblivious, Benjamin cheerfully lifted the ladle. "Of course!"

"Wait." Martha eyed the pot suspiciously. "You really only used pears?"

"Naturally!" Benjamin puffed his chest. "Excellent for clearing heat and moistening lungs."

Adrian spoke suddenly. "Did you consult a chef?"

"Well..." Benjamin scratched his head. "It's just pear soup. How complicated could it be?"

Martha swiftly took the pot. "Let me handle this. It needs tremella and wolfberries to taste good. Everyone wait—dessert's coming after dinner."

The children cheered. Stella and Adrian accidentally locked eyes before quickly looking away.

Adrian's quiet chuckle earned him a glare from Stella.

Dinner concluded in awkward silence. When Martha returned with the improved soup, Stella practically leaped up to help serve it.

"Mr. Roland should have some too," Martha said meaningfully. "You've been... irritable lately."

Adrian raised an eyebrow. "I'm not inflamed."

"Not that kind of heat." Martha winked. "You and Ms. Valentine haven't... Well, that look in your eyes earlier was downright predatory—"

Sputter!

Stella sprayed pear soup across the table. Fumbling with napkins, her voice shook. "T-too hot..."
###Chapter 498: Daddy Will Find a Chance to Apologize to Mommy

Martha smiled warmly as she added fuel to the fire. "Miss Stella, Mr. Roland's bowl is still empty. Why don't you serve him some too?"

Stella's fingers, clutching a tissue, paused slightly.

Adrian leaned on his cane, attempting to stand. "It's fine. I can help myself."

"Don't move." Stella frowned and pressed a hand on his shoulder. "Stop pushing yourself when your leg isn't healed yet."

Benjamin and Martha exchanged a glance, their lips curling into knowing smiles.

She ladled a bowl of pear soup and slid it toward him, her fingertips trembling faintly against the rim.

"Martha's cooking is as excellent as ever," Adrian remarked after taking a sip. "The tremella is perfectly tender, and the pears are refreshingly sweet. Perfect for this season."

Stella busied herself straightening the napkins. "Celeste, you never drink enough water. Have some more today."

"Mommy, this is way better than the soup at kindergarten!" Celeste gulped it down eagerly.

"Martha used to be a professional chef," Stella said, ruffling her daughter's hair.

Martha beamed, her eyes crinkling. "You flatter me, Miss Stella."

Stella gazed at the children's cheerful faces and murmured, "It really has been a long time since I last tasted your cooking."

"Come by more often, then! I'll cook for you every day!"

Stella gave a vague response.

After dinner, the children obediently settled down to do their homework. Ethan spread out his workbook to tackle math problems, Luna gripped her crayons with concentration, and Celeste brandished safety scissors excitedly. "Let's make a family portrait!"

"Isn't that too difficult?" Stella had just sat on the sofa when Adrian limped over with his cane.

"Daddy will help," he said gently.

Celeste clapped her hands in delight.

Stella stiffened before shoving the scissors into his hand. "I'll go help Martha in the kitchen."

She hurried away, leaving only a flustered silhouette behind.

Adrian sighed softly as he watched her retreating figure.

"Daddy," Luna looked up with innocent eyes, "did you make Mommy mad? Teacher says we should apologize when we do something wrong."

Celeste nodded vigorously. "Yeah! Daniel took my eraser last time, but after he said sorry, we became friends again!"

Adrian gave a wry smile and patted their heads. "Alright, Daddy will find a chance to apologize. For now, let's focus on the craft, okay?"

The two little girls snuggled against him, one on each side.

In the kitchen, Stella rolled up her sleeves to assist.

"No need, no need!" Martha waved her off. "Penny has already cleaned up."

Penny shrank into the corner, timid. "Stella, you're not here to scold me, are you?"

"Do I seem that scary?" Stella tapped her forehead lightly. "Just don't lie to me again."

As Martha washed strawberries, she suddenly remembered something. "Oh, when I came back this afternoon, I saw Mr. Roland sitting on the sofa, sighing heavily."

Stella's fingers twitched.

"Mr. Astor tried to console him for a long time, but it didn't help," Martha recalled. "Then Mr. Roland suddenly asked me how he's different from before."

Stella's head lifted instinctively.

"I searched for a while," Martha said quietly, "and finally found a single white hair at his temple."

The cloth in Stella's hand slipped into the sink.
###Chapter 499: The Older Bull Grazing on Young Grass

Vincent Astor had returned to the office to handle paperwork, while Benjamin Langley trimmed the garden hedges. Only Martha Clementson and Adrian Roland remained in the kitchen.

"Mr. Roland, you have a gray hair," Martha observed sharply.

Adrian immediately set down his teacup and strode to the mirror for closer inspection. His brow furrowed. "Martha, am I already going gray?"

"Just one strand," Martha replied honestly. "It's perfectly normal at your age. I once worked for an employer in his early twenties who had far more gray hairs than you."

Stella Valentine couldn't help but laugh at this. She glanced at Penny Anderson, who was already doubled over with laughter.

"How did he react?" Stella asked curiously.

Without hesitation, Adrian plucked out the offending strand.

Memories surfaced of Stella teasing him about their age difference. Those three years had felt significant during their youth—especially since she looked younger than her age, often mistaken for a middle schooler during their time in Milan.

Classmates used to whisper behind Adrian's back, calling him "the older bull grazing on young grass." Each time he overheard, his expression darkened like a storm cloud.

Sometimes Stella would deliberately point at him and say "older bull," then at herself with "young grass," sighing dramatically for effect.

Adrian would pull her into a crushing embrace, gritting his teeth. "Too late for regrets. You're stuck with me for life."

Back then, she'd shrug it off. "If you go first, I'll find some other old man to dance with at the park."

His response was always a searing kiss laced with quiet fury. "You wouldn't dare."

Martha gazed at Stella affectionately. "Miss Valentine, women your age are most sought after. I wouldn't be surprised if someone already has feelings for you."

"Who writes love letters these days?" Stella chuckled, shaking her head. "Besides, I barely received any in school."

"Impossible," Martha countered while arranging strawberries. "A girl like you must've had plenty of admirers."

Stella lowered her voice. "I wasn't the class beauty."

Truthfully, most boys had automatically excluded her from their romantic considerations—she'd already belonged to Adrian.

Penny gasped theatrically. "Stella, how stunning was your class beauty then?"

Stella recalled the girl's delicate features, reminiscent of a certain Hong Kong actress.

Martha steered the conversation back. "A woman of your caliber must have many secret admirers. That William asking you to dinner alone was highly inappropriate—clients don't do that."

Stella checked her reflection in the cupboard glass. "Don't I look like a mother of three?"

"William clearly didn't notice," Penny said earnestly. "He's definitely interested in you."

Martha nodded. "Men jump to conclusions too easily. You should recognize your own worth, Miss Valentine."

Stella sighed. "And he has such a beautiful girlfriend too."

Penny suddenly perked up with gossipy enthusiasm. "You said you barely got love letters—but did Mr. Roland ever write you one?"

Stella chose to answer the earlier question. "I never received romantic letters from suitors."

"So there were suitors?" Penny's eyes sparkled. "How did you turn them down?"

Stella's expression turned enigmatic. "...Actually, I'm not entirely sure."

She truly didn't know.

Because Adrian had always handled them.
###Chapter 500: Undercurrents of Emotion

Penny Anderson was about to press for answers when a familiar soft cough echoed from outside the kitchen.

She immediately fell silent and retreated to a corner, shrinking like a startled rabbit.

Adrian Roland entered carrying a crystal fruit bowl filled with glistening cherry tomatoes. He snorted. "Many have the intention, few dare to act."

Hiding behind the counter, Penny secretly gave a thumbs-up. The boss's intimidating aura never changed.

Stella Valentine's lips twitched. "What exactly did you do back then?"

Adrian's eyes cooled as he recalled those betrayals. "Nothing much. Just taught them the meaning of keeping one's word."

Those reckless youthful days now seemed both childish and thrilling. He unconsciously rotated his wrist, where an old scar remained.

"No wonder you always complain about wrist pain," Stella suddenly realized.

"Physics teacher said it best," he said solemnly. "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."

Stella suppressed a smile and popped a tomato into her mouth. The sweet-tart juice burst on her tongue like memories laced with both honey and vinegar.

Martha and Penny exchanged glances before quietly exiting with the fruit bowl.

"There was one who got away," Adrian suddenly admitted. "That slick-haired principal's son. Out of respect for the old man, I only used words, not fists."

Stella froze. She remembered that boy who always avoided her—apparently not out of dislike.

"How exactly did you 'educate' him?" She massaged her temples.

Adrian spread his hands innocently. "Just a few words. Who knew he'd be so easily frightened?"

Outside the door, eavesdropping Martha shook her head with a chuckle. "Ah, youth... Miss Stella is fortunate to have someone who protects her so fiercely."

Stella lowered her gaze. Without those misunderstandings, they could have been the couple everyone envied.

"Mommy! Daddy!" Luna came running with paper cutouts. "Teacher said this is family homework—we all have to do it together!"

Celeste added, "Big brother drew the hair. Daddy drew the face."

When Stella looked up, she met Adrian's smiling eyes. Resigned, she picked up a crayon and drew a happy face on the paper figure.

"Stella, I just remembered an unfinished proposal!" Penny grabbed her bag and bolted as if wolves were chasing her.

Just as Stella moved to follow, a hand caught her wrist.

"About William Aldridge," Adrian's voice turned low. "I know how men think. That dinner invitation? He definitely has ulterior motives."

As night deepened, Stella felt her cheeks grow warm. This jealous side of him hadn't changed one bit since their youth.
